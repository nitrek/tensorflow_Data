IMPORTANT

DEVELOPMENTS

MARKET REGULATION
During the past year, the Commission
undertook several actions of far-reaching
Importance to the seountres Industry, the
securities markets and the investing public. At the same time, the Congress
passed legislation enhancing and clarifyIng the Commission's
authority over the
securities
markets
and the securities
Industry
Perhaps the most significant
action
taken by the Commission was ItS adopnon of Securities
Exchange
Act Rule
19b-3 on January 23, 1975. That rule
required the elrrrunatron of fixed commission rates on exchange transactions as of
May 1, 1975--endlng
a practice which
had existed for over 175 years on the
nation's securities exchanges. The deersron to adopt Rule 19b-3 came after
nearly a decade of study by the Commission, the Congress and many others.
In adopting Rule 19b-3, the Commission
became the first federal requlatory agency
to substitute
competitive
pricing for a
previously
sanctioned
system of price
fixing within an Industry.
Among other things, the system of fixed
comrrussron rates was seen as hindering
progress toward the implementation
of
a national market system. The Comrrussron has continued ItS efforts toward the
development of such a system, including
progress toward the introduction
of a
consolidated tape for reporting securities
transactions
and a composite quotation
system.

The Commission and the Congress have
been acting together to take all necessary
and appropriate
steps to assure that
secuntres transactions are effected fairly
and efficiently at the best available price,
that competition
IS enhanced within the
secunties industry, and that information
with respect to quotations and transactions be made more fully available to
brokers, dealers and Investors. Much of
the Commission's work over the past year
has been directed toward the realization
of those goals.

The Securities Acts Amendments
of 1975
The Securities
Acts Amendments
of
19751, enacted June 4, 1975, significantly
revise and expand the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Among other things,
the Commission IS directed to facrtitate
the establishment
of a national market
system for securities
and a nationwide
system for the clearance and settlement
of securities
transactions,
clarify
and
strengthen
the Commission's
oversight
role with respect to self-regulatory
organizations, and provide for broad regulation of brokers, dealers,
and banks
trading In mumcrpal secuntres. The 1975
Amendments
further contain
new provisrons relating to fixed commrssron rates,
trading on national securities exchanges,
the payment for research services with
brokerage comrmssrons, and registration
and regulation of brokers and dealers 2
The National Market System The Com3

rmssion IS directed to facilitate the establishment of a national market system

systems, which will link all markets for

to foster ettrcrency, enhance competition,
Increase the information
available
to
brokers, dealers and Investors, tacrlrtate
the offsetting of Investors' orders and
contribute to best execution of such orders. To acrueve those objectives. the
Commission IS granted junsdrction over
persons who, by direct or indirect use of
the malls or any other instrumentality of
Interstate cornrnerce," are engaged In the
various stages of collecting, processing,
distributing
or publishing, on a current
and continuing basis, intorrnatron about
transactions In or quotations for any secunty (other than an exempted security)
Those persons, who are termed securities
information processors, and their acnvrtles
are subject to registratIOn and regulation
also
by the Commission. The cornmrssron
may prescribe rules and regulations relating to securities processing activities
by self-regulatory organizations, members
thereof, brokers or dealers which utrhze
any means of Interstate commerce
Certain new provisrons
require the
elimination of restrictive rules and practrees which either prevent brokers from
obtaining the best price for their customers or hinder market-making activities
within the national market system. Such
provrsions
as Sections
6(b),
11A(c),
15A(b), 19(b), 19(c), 19(e), and 23(a) seek
to prevent any unnecessary or inappropnate regulatory burden on competition
and to balance
the anti-competitive
rmplrcanons of any action by any selfregulatory organization or by the Comrnrssron with the purposes and considerations of the Exchange Act. Furthermore,
the 1975 Amendments expand the Commlssron's authority to regulate market
makers, specialists,
and other dealers
4

(including the authority to prohibit a firm
from acting both as a dealer and as a
broker In a security) to promote fair
competition
among such persons and
equal protection of all markets for qualrned securmes
and of all exchange
members, brokers and dealers.
The Commission IS directed to review
any and all rules of natronal secunties
exchanges which hrrut or condrtron the
ability of members to effect transactrons
otherwise than on such exIn securmes
changes and to report its conclusions to
Congress. Institution of proceedings
IS
required where any such rule Imposes a
burden upon competition
not necessary
or appropriate In furtherance of the Exchange Act.
The 1975 Amendments
also contain
certain powers which may be exercised
with respect to trading In listed securities
In the over-the-counter
markets. Addrtronally, the national secuntres exchanges
are permitted to commence trading in secuntres not otherwise listed by the issuer
on such exchanges after Commission
review and approval
Section 11A(d) requires the establishment of a National Market Advisory Board.
It IS to advise the commrssron on what
steps are appropriate to facilitate establishment of a national market system
and on significant
regulatory proposals
made by the Commission or any selfregulatory organization. It IS also directed
to study the possible need for a new selfregulatory
body, the National
Market
RegUlatory Board, which would administer the national market system, and to
report ItS conclusrons to Congress
Requletion of Clearing Agencies and
Transfer Agents. The 1975 Amendments
(Section 17A) establish a system of regulation extending to all facets of the secunnes handling process, designed to
promote prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactrons.
Clearing
agencies
must register
with
and report to the Commission, which Will
review the rules of such clearing agencies to determine whether they comply
with the statute's objectives. The primary
enforcement and inspection responsibilities over clearing
aqencres that are

banks IS assigned to whichever bank
regulatory agency is the appropriate regulatory
agency.
Rulemakmg
authority
concern 109 the safeguardmg of funds and
securities by bank clearing agencies IS
shared by the Commission and the appropriate bank regulatory agency.4
The Securities Exchange Act IS further
amended to require transfer agents, other
than banks, to register with the Commlssion. Bank transfer agents must register with the appropriate bank regulatory
agency. The Commission is granted broad
rulemaking power over all the aspects of
a transfer agent's activities. Nevertheless,
as with clearing aqencres, where a transfer agent IS a bank, mspecnon and enforcement responsibilities
are vested 10
the appropriate bank regulatory agency
and rulemakmg authority concern 109 the
safeguard 109 of funds and securities by
bank transfer agents IS shared by the
Commission
and the appropriate
bank
regulatory agency.
Section
17A(e) requires
the Commission to eliminate the physical movement of secunties certificates during the
settlement process. In addition, the Comrmssron IS directed, in Section 12(m), to
study the practice of registering securrties
10 "street name," i.e., 10 a name other

MUniCipal Securities.
New Section 15B
Initiates a comprehensive pattern for the
registration
and regulation
of brokers,
dealers and banks that buy, sell, or effect
10 municipal
securities as
transacnons
part of their regular business 10 other
than a fidUCiary capacity. Issuers of municipal securities contmue to be exempt
from the registration
provrsions of the
federal secuntres acts.
A MuniCIpal
Securities
Rulemakmg
Board is created to prescnbe rules regulatmg the acnvmes of brokers, dealers
and municipal securities dealers relatmg
10 mumclpal
secunnes,
to transactions
Its scope of authority and responsibility
IS defmed
in terms
of enumerated
purposes
and
standards.
Section
15B(b)(2)(K), for example, sets forth the
requirement that the Board establish the
terms and conditions
under which any

rnurucrpal secuntres
dealer may sell any
part of a new Issue of municipal securities
to a municipal securities investment portfolio durmg the underwriting period. The
Commission IS required to take affirmative action on rules proposed by the
Board and is authonzed
to abrogate,
add to, or delete from any Board rule.
The commrssron may directly regulate
fraudulent,
manipulative,
and deceptive
acts and practices pursuant to Sections
10(b) and 15(c) of the Exchange Act.
The Board Will be comprised of representatives of broker-dealers,
banks and
the public, mcludmg Issuers of and investors 10 muruclpat securities.
(Sec.
15B(b)(1).) The procedures
to be followed in the nomrnatron and election of
members of the Board are desrqned to
assure fair adrnmrstratron of the Board
and fair representation of all segments of
the municipal securities
industry (Sec.
15B(b)(2)(B). The Board IS authorized to
hire appropriate
staff and to assess
municipal
securities
dealers to cover
reasonable expenses (Secs. 15B(b) (2)(I) and (J).
The Board's rulemakmg
powers are
extensive
(Sec.
15B(b)(2)(AHK).)
The
purposes for which the Board can exercise its rulemaking
authority
include:
prevention of fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices; promotion of just and
equitable principles of trade; establishment of standards
for entry mto the
municipal sscuntles business: regulation
of selling
and underwntrnq
practices;
procedures for arbitration of intra-Industry
disputes; and deterrninatron of the frequency and scope of inspections
of
municipal securities dealers by the bank
requlatory
authorities
With respect to
banks and the NASD with respect to
secunnes firms.
The Board does not have any power to
conduct Inspections or to enforce its rules
Instead, the Securttles Exchange Act asto the NASD
signs these responsjblhtres
for securities firms which are members of
the NASD (Secs. 15A(b)(7) and 15B(c)(7).
Similarly, such responsibilities
are assigned to the bank regulatory agencies
for municipal securities
dealers wmcn
are banks (Secs. 15B(c)(5) and 17(b).

As of June 30, 1975, the Commission
had taken Initial steps to Implement the
statutory goals of Section 15B. On June
12, 1975, the Commission announced the
solicitation
of recommendations
of individuals for appointment to the Municrpal Securities
Rulemaklng Board.s The
Commission
plans to continue to work
toward the creation
of a registration
process for sscunnes firms and banks engaged In the murucipal securities Industry
as well as the establishment of cooperative
efforts with appropriate
bank regulatory
agencies
Brokers and dealers that buy, sell, or
effect transactions In municipal securities
and banks that buy and sell such secuntres as a part of a regular business
other than In a fiduciary
capacity are
required to register with the Commission
(Sec. 15B(a)(1). If a bank engages in the
business of trading murucipal securities
through a separately Identifiable department or divtsion, that department or division rather than the entire bank can
register
with
the Commission
(Secs
3(a)(30) and 15B(b)(2)(1I). Brokers and
dealers already registered with the Comrnrssron by reason of their general secuntres business
are not required
to
re-reqrster.
No person IS permitted
to
engage In the business of trading
In
rnumcipat
securities
unless
registered
With the Commission and the Commission
has the authority,
In accordance
With
specified
procedures,
to revoke
the
registration of any person found to be in
Violation of the Securities Exchange Act,
or any rule of the Commission
or the
Board (Sec. 15B(c)(2).
Commission
Rates. The 1975 Amendments prohibit
the Imposition
of any
schedule or fixing of rates of commissions, allowances,
discounts,
or other
fees by a national securities exchange to
be charged by ItS members for effecting
exchange
transactions
A
temporary
exemption
postpones
such prohibition
for odd-lot dealers or for a member acting
as broker on the floor of a national secunnes exchange for another member.
The Commission
may permit a national
securities exchange to Impose reasonable
fixed commissions (1) prior to November
6

1, 1976, If such fixed rates are found to
be in the publrc Interest, and (2) after
November
1, 1976, if the Commission
institutes a proceeding and makes ceras set forth In Sectain deterrrunatrons,
tion 6(e). Additional provisions, such as
Section 6(f) and Section 11A(c), grant
authority to the Commission to remedy
problems
affecting
the orderliness
of
trading on exchanges
The elimination
of fixed rates raised
questions for Investment managers who
may be required to pay a broker for related research services. To protect an investment
manager against a claim of
breach of fiduciary obligation if he paid
more than the lowest available price for
execution and research services, Section
28(e) permits him to pay a cornrrusston
for executing
a transaction
above the
lowest available price If he determines In
good faith that It was reasonable consrdering the value of the brokerage
and
research services provided. The legislative history of that provrsion makes It
clear that Section 28(e) applies only to
payments made by a money manager to
a member of a national securities exchange, broker, or dealer for services
rendered
by that
particular
member,
broker or dealer, and that It has no application
whatsoever
to a situation
In
which payment IS made by an Investment
manager to one broker or dealer for
services rendered by another broker or
dealer."
Brokers
and Dealers.
A Significant
amendment to Section 11(a) of the Exchange Act prohibits,
With certain excepnons,
any member
of a national
secuntres exchange from effecting
any
transaction on such exchange for its own
account, the account of an associated
person, or an account over which It or an
associated person thereof exercises investment discretion
For members of a
national securities exchange as of May 1,
1975, the proscriptions
do not apply
until May 1, 1978. The Commission
IS
authorized to regulate transactions executed off an exchange or otherwise not
prohibited.
The 1975 Amendments
expand the
scope of the Commission's authonty un-

der Section 15(a) to Include the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers who trade exclusively on a national
securities exchange. With respect to new
registrations of all brokers and dealers,
the Commission
IS required within 45
days either to Issue an order granting
such registration or institute a proceedIng to determine
whether
registration
should be denied. Among other sections
15(b) authorizes the
amended, secnon
Commission to adopt uniform standards
for persons engaged in the securities
industry.
Accounts and Records. Section 17 of
the Exchange Act has been expanded to
provide for record-keeping and reporting
requrrements
of the various new regulated entities and that certified tmancral
financial statements of brokers and dealers be filed with the Oommlssron
and
sent to their customers. Section 17(e)(2)
permits the adoption of rules prescribing
the form and content of financial statements filed pursuant to the Exchange Act
and the accounting principles and standards
employed
in their
preparation
Section 17(f) requires, in part, (1) the
Implementation of a system of reporting
information about missing, lost, counterfeit, or stolen sscunnes and (2) the fingerprinting of the partners, directors, officers,
and employees of every member of a
national
securities
exchange,
broker,
dealer, registered
transfer
agent, and
registered clearing agency.

ties exchange indicated that It would
comply With the Commission's request,
other national sscunnes exchanges indicated that they would not comply voluntarily With the Commission's request.
Consequently, the Commission proposed
Rules 19b-3 and 10b-22 under the Exchange
Act
for comment
and held
hearings to receive Views, data and arguments from interested persons on both
the proposed rules and the proposed
effective date of May 1, 1975.
.......As a result of the hearings, the Commission adopted Rule 19b-3 With modifications from the form first published for
comment Specifically, the required elimination of "floor brokerage"
rates was
delayed until May 1, 1976. The Commission determined not to adopt proposed
Rule 10b-22, which related to agreements
among exchange members for the setting
of brokerage rates. The Commission's
administrative
action has been legislatively affirmed In Section 6(e) of the 1975
Amendments.
V After carefu I consideration of all the
arguments advanced In the hearings on
Rule 19b-3, of the numerous studies made
concerrunq cornmlssron rates, and of the
recent experience of both the Commission and the securities
Industry With

ItS basic reason for the adoption of Rule

and registered national securities associations; and studying the Income, expenses, assets and liabilities of specialists
and the activity of certain stocks.
On May 2, 1975, the Oornmrssron
announced the adoption of Rule 17a-20

For the months of May and June, New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) brokerdealers Incurred a revenue loss from
cornrrussron rate discounts of approxrmately $42 million. Thrs revenue loss was
approximately
7.6 percent of total secunnes commission revenue and 4 percent of total revenue dunnq thiS period
lndivrdual customers paid slightly more
on small size orders and slightly less on
large orders. The net effect in June was
a decline averaging 1.5 to 2 percent In
the cornrnlssron rate charged on all indivrdual orders. Institutional
customers,
on the other hand, received discounts In
all order size categories and received
an average discount of 19 5 percent In the
month of June. The experience With competitive rates for non-NYSE firms durrnq
the May and June period was Similar to
that of NYSE member firms.
Based upon the preliminary
and incomplete
evidence
of
two
months'
experience (May-june,
1975) With com8

rates during a period of rising
trading volume, historical
trading

markets appear not to have
altered Similarly, the tmancral condition
of self-regulatory organizations does not
appear to have been materially affected.

Development of the National
Market System
Advisory Committee on the Implementation of a Central
Market
System.
As
descnbed In last year's Annual Report,13
the Commission established an Advisory
Committee on the Implementation
of a
Central Market System to assist It In connection With ItS proposals for a central
market system and to ensure that such a
system would meet the needs of the
nation's capital markets In the future,
consistent With the publrc Interest and the
protection of Investors.
Specrtrcalty, the Committee was asked
to study and to submit recommendations
to the Cornrnissron on such matters as:
a. The
appropriate
structure
for
regulatory supervrsron of the central
market system;
b The nature and scope of the
Oomrmssron's
role during the process
of Implementing
the central
market
system;
c. The ways in which a central market system should be structured
In
order effectively to meet the needs of
our capital markets, the public interest,
the protection
of investors and the
maintenance of fair and orderly markets
for securities;
d. The needs and perspectives of
users of a central market system, including
Issuers of and Investors In
securities, as well as securities protessronats: and
e. The appropriate
resolution
of
fundamental policy Issues relating to
the central market system's operations.
The Committee, composed of twelve
persons, eight of whom are from the securities Industry, was assisted by members of the Oommlssron's staff The staff
attempted to Identify for the Committee
a number of unresolved Issues which the

Committee
might
consider,
including
(1) the registration
requirements
and
caprtal standards appropriate for marketmakers granted access to the system,
(2) the responsibthtres
of market-makers
when acting as agents in the system;
and (3) the responstbtlrtles
of marketmakers acting as dealers In the system
Certain structural questions were also
raised: Whether lrrrut orders for pubuc
customers should be held In a consolidated limit order book and, If so, who
should be permitted access to the book,
whether
specialists
or market-makers
should be prohrbited from dealing directly
With public customers; and how the role
of transactions between customers would
be effected Without the use of brokers or
specialists In the central market system.
In addition, the staff suggested that the
Committee
consider
rules on auction
trading and priorities for public customers' orders in the new central market
system.
In a preliminary statement Issued December 11, 1974, 14 the Committee noted
that Its suggestions would be made Without regard to whether It was feasible to
utrhze exrstinq technology to Implement
ItS suggestIOns and that although
not
unanimous
its preliminary
views
did
reflect the sense of the Committee as a
whole. Particular
emphasis was placed
on auction-market
principles in a central
market system, which were considered
the most effective means of encouraging
competition
among buyers and sellers.
The preliminary
statement of the Committee
set forth
specific
conclusions
with respect to specialists'
net capital,
market oontinuity and public preferance
obligations, outlined the manner in which
limit
orders
entered
with
specialists
should be treated, and descnbed possible
trading
limitations
to be imposed
on
specialists.
Stressing the importance of
preserving the dealer function of brokers,
the Committee recognized the importance
of the role played by over-the-counter
dealers in the markets and the necessity
of providing an adequate opportunity and
Incentive for their continued participation
in a central market system.
On July 15, 1975, the Comrmttee sub-

mltted to the Commission, In preliminary
form, a Summary
Report of its final
conclusrons
The Summary Report reemphasized
that the views enunciated
were not unanimous or endorsed by all
members without reservation
The Summary Report defined the objectives of the central market system as
follows:
a To provide all Investors WIth the
maximum opporturnty to buy and sell
securitres at the best possrble price,
b To provide the depth and Irqutdrty
necessary to tacrlrtate
the ralsrnq of
capital by issuers; and
c To provide a mechanism for the
consurnrnanon
of transactions
at a
reasonable cost.
the
To accomplish
these objectrves,
Summary Report envlsioned that the central market system must include all transacuons In securities listed on exchanges
and permit access to all specrahsts,
qualified
market-makers
and qualified
broker-dealers
The
Committee
emphasized
that
auction-market
principles, including preference for all public orders, would be
essentral to the central market system
The system's
rules, according
to the
Summary Report, should provide that all
orders entered for the account of persons
other than brokers or dealers would have
preference over orders entered by protesstonals. Among system professionals,
however, the orders of specralrsts and
market-makers
would be permitted
to
displace orders of other broker-dealers
dealing for their own account
An Important role was recommended
for specialists
on the various
stock
exchanges. The Cornrruttee also recommended that the system permit participation of all market-makers,
including
those now dealing In the third market
(i.e , over-the-counter
trading In secunnes listed on exchanges).
The report
spelled out In some detau respcnsrbrlrnes
of specialists and market-makers
entering quotations in the system, including
their minimum net capital. The Summary
Report indicated
that there should be
trading and competition
among special9

IStS and market-makers dealing in the
same secuntres.
The Summary Report stated that both
specialists and market-makers should be
required to maintain continuous, fair and
orderly markets In those securities
In
which they are registered to deal. The
Committee, however, drew an Important
distinction between the two. specraltsts
would be assigned to deal In particular
secunues, so that at least one specialrst
would be responsible for maintaining a
market in every listed security; registered
market-makers would be permitted to select the secunties In which they dealt
Market-makers would also be permitted
to deal with all types of customers, while
specialrsts would be prohibited from dealIng directly with institutional
customers
and with insiders, officers and directors
of the Issuers of the securities In which
they made markets
Thrs restriction on speciausts' dealings
was seen to be directly related to their
role as agents for the limit orders of pubuc customers. The Committee envrsroned
that limit orders would be guaranteed
exposure to all transactions
In system
secunues only if they were placed with
specransts.
Although
market-makers
would be permitted to hold and execute
limit orders, they would guarantee exposure of such orders to all system transactions only by usmq a specialtst. The
Summary Report recognized "best execution" as the primary duty of brokers In the
system, detailing certain aspects of that
duty In the context of an operational
central
market system. The Summary
Report also indicated that the system
should maximize the opportunities
for
brokers to execute orders for their customers without
a specianst
or other
qualified
market-maker
participating
In
the transaction.
A central self-regulatory authority, with
the responsibility and authority to Impose
rules and regulations on all specrausts,
market-makers and broker-dealers tradIng In listed securities was deemed Important by the Committee. Early In ItS
consrderatron. the Committee had recommended that such a body be established
as soon as posstble, In view of the opera10

non of the consolidated
tape, the diSsemrnatron of quotations In listed secunnes and the unftxrnq of commission
rates. SUbsequently, however, the Committee recognized that creation of such
a board would be inappropriate so long
as the National Market Advisory Board,
called for by the seounnee Acts Amendments of 1975, was assiqned responsrbility to study the governance of the
central market system. Therefore, it urged
that the Board and the Oomrrussron
monitor the events taking place toward
the development
of a central market
system to Insure the existence of an appropriate regulatory framework.
The Committee believed the most efticrent and effective structure for governIng the central market system would be
provided
by the merger of presently
exrstrnq exchanges dealing In secuntrss
to be Included In the system. The Committee pointed out, however, that while a
true central market system Involves some
form of centralized control, a merger of
the exchanges would not be a prerequisrte
The Committee concluded ItS summary
report With a series of recommendations
for Oornrnlssron action. Included were
recommendations,
made early In the
Committee's deliberations, for Imposition
of rules dealing with short-seiling
and
minimum capital requirements for specralrsts and market-makers.
The Comrmssron has already taken action on these
matters.
In addition,
the Committee
recommended
that all specratlsts and
market-makers be required to maintain
bona fide, continuous and competitive
two-srded quotations for each security
In which they make a market and that
such quotations bear a reasonable relationship to the last sale in those secunnes.
The Committee
recognized
as particularly
important
ItS recommendation
that the New York Stock Exchange and
the American Stock Exchange be permitted to retain their present rules causIng members to bring all trades In
securities on those exchanges to the
respective trading floors. The Committee
recognized that such rules pertaining to
specmc market centers Will be map-

propriate in the central market system
but concluded that they should not be
eliminated until such time as a similar
rule can be imposed for the system as a
whole A system-wide rule was thought
to be appropriate
when a composite
quotation system was In operation, faCilitating members' efforts to achieve best
execution, and when a consolidated limit
order
book was established,
making
possible the execution of public orders
in all market places.
The Commission expects to receive a
final report, with dissenting Views, from
the Committee In the fall of 1975. It IS
anticipated that the work of the Committee
Will constitute
a beginning

deliberations by the new NatIOnal Market
System Advisory Board called for by the

Consolidated Tape
As previously reported.!" a plan for the
consolidated reporting of price and volume data, filed jorntly by the Amerrcan,
Midwest, Pacific, PBW and New York
Stock Exchanges and the National Association
of secunues
Oealers,
Inc.
("NASO"), was declared effective by the
Commission as of May 17, 1974.17 The
joint industry plan (the "Plan") provided
for a tape consisting of two separate
ticker
"networks,"
displayed
concurrently. Network A would report transactions In stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and Network
B, transactions
In stocks listed on the
American Stock Exchange ("Amex") and
certain stocks listed only on the participating regional exchanges. Both networks
would report all trades in their respective
stocks, regardless of whether they took
place on an exchange or In the so-called
"third market." In addition, Information
disseminated
over Networks A and B
would also be available
through
interrogation
devices, enabling investors
and market professionals to obtain the
most recent last sale price for any stock
covered by the system regardless of the
market of execution. The system was designed to be compatible With equipment
presently found in most brokerage offices.

The Plan contemplated that the consolidated tape would be put Into operation In two phases beglnnrng Within 20
weeks after Commission approval of the
Plan. The pilot phrase was to be a 20week period of experimental operation
covering a limited number of stocks, after
which full operation of the consolidated
tape would begin, by reporting and disseminating
last sale data of eligible
securities to be Included in Networks A
and B by means of a high-speed line.
Thrs would permit reception of reported
information on a current baSIS, regardless
of any delay In the dissemination of the
information
over Networks
A and B
caused by the servicrnq of interrogation

devices.
Actual Implementation of the consolidated tape lagged behind the 40-week
time period contemplated
by the Plan,
pnncipally because the Original estimate
was overly
optimistic
and failed
to
anticrpate
the technical
problems
inherent In the development of the new
computer system that was required. Also,
both the sponsors and the Commission
believed that certain
regUlatory problems should be addressed before the
Implementation of the consolidated tape.
Phase I of the consolidated tape system was Originally scheduled to commence on October 4, 1974. It was deferred
for a two-week period by the Commission,
In response to a request by the NYSE, to
permit resolution of certain mechanical
problems the NYSE believed would have
arisen as a result of the Commission's
amendments to ItS short sale rulesSecurities
Exchange Act Rules 3b-3,
10a--1, and 10a--218 The amendments to
the short sale rules had the effect of
prohibrtmq
short sales of a security
listed on an exchange at a price below
the last pnor sale (a "minus tick"), or at
the last sale price if the preceeding
different sale price had been at a higher
prrce (a "zero minus tick"), as reported
on the consolidated system. The amendments applied the Commission's
short
sale regUlation, for the first time, In a
uniform manner to all markets In which
transactions In listed securities occurred,
and were part of the Oornmrssron's efforts
11

to resolve certain regulatory
problems
before the Implementation
of the consolidated tape But after reviewing the
problems created by the uniform short
sale rule, the Commission determined to
suspend the operation of the amendments, and the pilot phase of the consolidated
system began operation
as
rescheduled on October 18,1974
Although full operation
of the consolidated
tape system was Originally
scheduled for February 21, 1975, It became obVIOUSto all the Plan participants
by mid-January

of the CTA with respect to the full implementation of the Plan. The CTA response
of March 26, 1975, to staff mqurries regarding the delay, which detailed descnptions
of the reasons for testing
delays, was released by the Oomrrussron
on May 1, 1975.20 The Oornmlssion issued

release specrtymq

displays on interroqauon systems,21 which helped resolve questions concerning

19, 1975, the Consolidated Tape Associa-

Between February and June 1975, the
Plan participants conducted an extensive

tion ("CTA"), the governing body for the
consolidated system, Informed the Commrssion
that, because of testing delays and recent problems with the Market
Data System of the NYSE, the CTA expected to be able to Implement only
certain elements on or before June 16,
1975.19 Specrncally, It expected that on
or before June 16, 1975' (1) last sale data
regarding transactions in all eligible secuntres required to be Included In Network A of the consolidated system would
be reported In accordance with the Plan
by all Plan participants (other than the
Amex) and by four other "reporting
parties" (r.e., the Boston Stock Exchange,
the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, the Detroit Stock Exchange, and the Institutional
Network Corporation ("Instinet"»
to the
Securities Industry Automation Corporation ("SIAC"),
the Plan processor, and
(2) such last reports would be transmitted
by SIAC to vendors of market information
on a low-speed basis. The CTA's letter
indicated that maximum effort was being
expended on making Network A operational as soon as possible, and that SIAC
was continuing
to program
for the
requirements
of Network
B and the
high-speed line.
On March 3, 1975, after indicating that
it would not object to the delay, the Commission stated that It was disappointed
by the delay but that It understood that
certain of the reasons for the delay were
beyond the control of the CTA. The Comrnissron also stated that the staff would
be making inquiry of the CTA as to the

test program to Insure the accuracy, reliability and integrity of programming for
Network A. Personnel from the various
exchanges, SIAC and the vendors subjected the system to a broad range of
Simulated market condiuons. All the tests
proved successful, and the CTA was able
to fully Implement Network A reporting
on a low-speed baSIS on June 16, 1975.
The CTA IS currently continuing work on
the remaining elements of the consolidated system-Network
B and the hlghspeed line. A final date, however, has
not yet been set for full implementation
of all elements of the consolidated system.
Implementation of Network A of the consolidated
tape, while not constituting
full Implementation
of the Plan, IS a
major step toward the eventual achievement of a central market system. Transactions executed In markets other than
on the floor of the NYSE are now appearIng on moving tickers for the first time.
Such transactions are Indicated on the
tape by an ampersand tollowrnq
the
symbol for the NYSE-listed stock The
ampersand, In turn, IS followed by a letter
that Identifies the specrnc market place.
Those letters are' M for Midwest; P
for Pacrnc: X for PBW; C for Cincinnati;
T for NASD (r.e., the third market); and
for Insllnet. The Boston Stock Exchange
-Identified
by the letter B--was added
to the consolidated tape on July 14, 1975,
and the Detroit Stock Exchange--Identifled by the letter D-IS expected to be
added to the system sometime In late
summer or early fall, 1975.

o

The inclusion of NYSE, regional and
third market transactions
on a single
consolidated
tape, even on the limited
scale currently In place, enables investors
to make more Informed Judgments regarding which market centers offer the most
advantageous price at a particular time.
Even though the Information presented on
the consolidated tape IS essentially histoncal information, i.e., prices at which
transactions
were effected In the past
rather than prices at which future transactions may be effected, such information
should be useful to Investors In indicating
general trends and temporary price disparities between market centers.
In addition to its benefits to Investors,
the consolidated tape represents a significant
technological
achievement
In
the processing of securities information.
The consoltdated tape IS not Just a mechanical merger of exrstinq ticker networks but a completely
new computer
system tying together all the nation's
market centers. Sophisticated and complex programs had to be developed to
Insure that the different equipment and
programs
of various
exchanges
and
the NASD could be accommodated, and,
perhaps more important, to Insure that all
last sale reports would be reported on the
consolidated
tape in the proper sequence. All the complex programming
changes were accomplished successfully,
and the CTA and the Commission are
presently looking forward to Implementation of the high-speed line, which for the
first time Will provide Investors with last
sale reports on a current baSIS, even In
the event of delays In ticker dissemination
due to mechanical limitations.

Composite Quotation System
When the Commission issued ItS first
proposed rule on composite transaction
reporting in March 1972, it also proposed
Exchange
a companion rule-e-Secuntles
Act Rule 17a-14-governlng
the development
of a composite
quotation
system.23
Rule 17a-14,
as Originally
proposed, would have required all national
securities
exchanges
to make
quotations of their registered specialists

available on a current and contmumq
baSIS to vendors of market Information.
Similarly, the NASD would have been
required to make available to such vendors on a current and continuing baSIS
quotations of market makers With respect
to over-the-counter
quotations
In secunties listed or traded on exchanges.
On August 14, 1974, the Commission
released for public comment a substantial revrsion to proposed Rule 17a-1424
as a result of the many comments which
had been received, the recommendations
of the Commission's Advisory Committee
on Market Disclosure regarding a composite quotation system, and the Commission's experience With Implementation
of a consolidated
transaction reporting
system under Rule 17a-15.
The major change In Rule 17a-14 from
the original proposal was that the revised
rule required the reporting of quotations
pursuant to a plan Similar to that required
by Rule 17a-15. Accordingly, Rule 17a-14,
as revised, would have required every
national
securities
exchange
and the
NASD to report to the Commission quotations of their market makers or specialists
In listed securities. The quotations were
to be available on a real-time, current
and continuing baSIS.
The Commission received many publiC
comments With respect to ItS August 1974
proposal. After considering all of the public comments, the Commission determined
to adopt a new approach desiqned to increase the availability
of quotation information without potentially burdensome
federal requlation. On March 11, 1975,
the Commission announced that It had
requested
all national
secuntrss
exchanges to effect changes in their rules
and practices to be effective on or before
May 1, 1975, to eliminate those which
restricted, or had the effect of restricting,
access to or use of quotation information
disseminated by such exchanges to any
quotation vendor.25 At the same time, the
Commission announced that It was deferring further consrderation
of proposed
Rule 17a-14 until It had had an opportunity to observe the effects of eliminating
restrictions on quotation drssemmatron.
In announcing ItS new approach, the
13

Oommrssron
reiterated ItS view that quotation information, such as that currently
provided by some exchanges to their
members, IS essential to broker-dealers,
whether members or not, In discharging
their duty of reasonable diligence In the
execution of customers' orders.26 By requesting
the elimination
of exchange
restrictions
on quotation drssernrnanon,
the Commission Intended that as a result
of competitive forces a composite quotation system would develop with a minimum of federal regulation.
On May 7, 1975, the Commission announced that It had received responses
(to ItS March 11, 1975 request) from all
national secuntres exchanges and that all
exchanges either had taken the acllon
requested by the Commission
or had
Informed the Commission that they did
not have any rules or practices which
restricted access to, or use of, such Intorrnatrcn.s" In making ItS announcement,
the Commission added that, In ItS View,
the actions taken by the various exchanges would tacrlrtate the establishment
of a central market system, as contemplated by the Market
Structure
Statement 2H and the PolIcy Statement,29
by
making possible the composite display of
quotation information for multiply traded
securities.

Short Sale Regulation
On March 6, 1974, the Commission
proposed amendments to Securrties Exchange Act Rules 3b-3, 10a-1 and 10a-2
In order to establish uniform short sale
rules, which were considered to be a
necessary element of the consolidated
reporting system.30 After analyzing the
comments
received
on the proposed
amendments and concluding that no serious objections had been raised, the Commission announced their adoption to be
effective October 4, 1974 (the "October
Amendments")."!
In a letter to the Comrrussron, dated October 11,1974, the New
York Stock Exchange asserted that the
October Amendments would create insurmountable technical, operational and
regulatory problems
In view of the problems noted by the
14

NYSE, the Commission temporarily suspended the effectiveness of the October
Amendments to Rules 10a-1 and 10a-2.32
The effect of that suspension was to leave
the regulallon of short sales on exchange
markets as it had existed before adoption
of the October Amendments, while the
Commission continued to study the most
efficient,
effective and fair manner to
achieve uniform short sale regulation In
a central market system.
On March 5, 1975, the Commission
published for comment additional
proposed amendments to Rule 10a-1, (the
"March Proposals").33 The Commission
noted that many persons believed that
short selling should not be regulated at
all, except to the extent It IS used as a
of
manipulative
devlce.34 Consrderatron
such arguments,
however,
had been
hampered by a lack of current statistical
studies of the pattern of short seiling in
today's markets, particularly on regional
securities
exchanges and In the third
market. In any event, the Commission
thought It would be premature to consider
elimination of short sale regulation (altogether or for any class of short sellers)
before additional progress was made toward the establishment
of a central
market system. Nevertheless, the Commrssron
specmcalty
encouraged
comments on the feasibility
and probable
effects of exempting from regulation short
sales by persons other than brokers and
dealers,
or of eliminating
short sale
regulation entirely.
The Commission acknowtedqed in the
announcement
of the March Proposals
that use of the proposed rules In the consolidated
system might
pose certain
operational problems for those exchange
ma'rkets which regularly experienced a
high volume In reported securities but
had not yet modernized their facilities so
that access to intormanon reported in a
consolidated system was not immediately
available on the floor of the exchange.
For that reason, the March Proposals
provided, as an alternative to the Commrssron's general rule, that any national
securities exchange, by rule, might prohibit short sales of reported sscunnes
In ItS own market (i) below the last sale

price on that exchange, or (ii) at the last
sale price, unless that price was above
the next preceding different sale price.
The March Proposals also provided that
short sa es of reported secuntres effected
on any exchange
having such a rule
would have to comply With that exchange's
rule and that such compliance
would
constitute compliance With paragraph (a)
of Rule 10a-1, as amended.
Network A of the consolidated
system
commenced operation on June 16, 1975.
In order to ensure comparable short sale
regulation of all transactions in reported
secuntres
In all markets reporting transactions to that system, the Commission
announced on June 12, 1975, the adoption of amendments to Rules 10a-1 and
10a-2 (effective June 16, 1975), which
were Identical, In all material respects, to
the March Proposals.35
Paragraph (a) of Rule 10a-1 will not
apply to short sales of any reported secunty until last sale information on that
security is made available to vendors of
market information on a real-time basis.
When such information
becomes available on a real-time basis, paragraph (a)
of Rule 10a-1 will govern short sales In
all markets (including
transactions
effected on national secuntres exchanges
and In the over-the-counter
market)
Additionally,
national
securities
exchanges will have an option either to
adopt their own short sale rules, subject
to the Commission's power under Section
19 of the Securities Exchange Act, or be
governed by paragraph (b) of Rule 10a-1,
the tradrnonal
form of the rule, which
applies only to short sales effected on
national securities exchanges.

Option Market Regulation
By the end of fiscal year 1975, the
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.
("CBOE"),
whose option plan were approved by the Commission In the preceding fiscal year, had 1,025 members and
listed call options on 67 stocks.36 The
average dally volume of options traded
on CBOE reached approximately
53,000
contracts, representing
5,300,000 shares
of the underlying stocks."

DUring the past fiscal year, the Commission declared effective option plans
of two other exchanges,
the American
Stock Exchange (Amex) and the PBW
Stock Exchange, Inc. ("PBW"). The Comrmssion declared the Amex option plan
effective In December 1974,38 and that
exchange began trading call options on
January 7, 1975. By the end of the fiscal
year, the Amex listed options
on 40
stocks, and had an average dally volume
of 17,016 contracts, representing 1,701,600
shares of underlying stock.
In May 1975, the Oomrrussron declared
PBW's option plan effective and that exchange began trading options on June
27,1975.39
In addition to the three exchanges With
effective option plans, the Pacrtrc Stock
Exchange ("PaCifiC") announced
ItS intention to initiate options trading and held
several discussions with the Oommrssron's
staff regarding ItS preliminary work on a
plan for such a program.
DUring the fiscal year, the CBOE, With
Commission
approval,
made numerous
changes In ItS option plan under Rule
9b-1. For example, In response to Commission and CBOE concern about emerging trading patterns in options where the
exercise
price had fallen substantrally
below
the
market
price,
the CBOE
restricted opening transactions
In such
options.w At the same time, the CBOE
prohibited
market makers from quoting
spreads In such options greater than Y4
to
of $1.41 It also adopted provrsions
tacrlrtate more orderly openings of tradIng and to eliminate
market-makers'
ability to gain priority over public orders
The CBOE also strengthened
ItS net
capital and margin rules.
The Arnex option plan, like that of the
CBOE, calls for trading In options on
stocks with a substantial
number
of
shares outstanding, Widely held and actively traded. Members of the Amex, at
the time ItS option plans were declared
effective,
automatically
obtained option
trading pnvileqes on that exchange. In
general,
the
Amex
applied
contract
standardization
methods
substantially
Identical to those used by the CBOEthat IS, options were made fungible by
15

limiting the contract variables such as
expiration months and the exercise, or
"striking", prices.
The Amex options generally are traded
In a manner very srrmlar to that for other
secuntres traded on that exchange. A rnajor difference between the Amex's program and the CBOE's IS that the Amex
uses, with certain modifications, a single
specralist both to make a market and to
handle agency limit orders In Its options,
while the CBOE splits the specrausts
functions
between
a
market-maker
(dealer) and a board broker, performing
the agency tuncnon.« One modification
Amex made In ItS floor trading procedure
IS that ItS registered floor traders who
trade options are required tp trade In a
way that assists the spscraust In maintaining a fair and orderly market In options, and may be called upon by either
a floor official or floor broker to make
competitive quotations In the market.
The PBW's program IS Similar to that of
Amex and CBOE In such areas as the
characteristics
of underlying stocks for
ItS options, clearing principles, and contract term standardization for ItS options.
like the Amex, the PBW utruzes its existIng specialrsts for market making in ItS
options and requires ItS regIstered floor
traders to assist the specralrsts
PBW's
plan, however, Involves for the first time
options traded on the same exchange as
the one on which the underlying secuntres
are traded
Because of this distinctive
characteristic, the PBW has separated ItS
option floor from the rest of Its trading
floor to prevent VIsual and direct auditory comrnumcatron
between the two
trading areas. The PBW also protubrts ItS
floor members who have learned of
certain large transactions
about to be
executed In an optron or an underlying
security of an option class traded on the
PBW from initiating orders In the same
option until two minutes after the transaction has been printed on the transaction
tape.43 These measures were desiqned
primarily to bar possrble misuse In PBW's
optron market of mtorrnatron obtained by
floor members relating to activity in an
underlying stock or In a block of options

has been publicly

As previously reported,44 on the basis
conclusrons
reached tollowmq
the
comrmssron's hearings In early 1974 on
multiple-exchange
options trading
and
options trading in general, the staff had
of

suggested
SUbject matters to be addressed
by all exchanges
concerned
before the initiation of multiple-exchange
options trading or the expansion of the
CBOE (which was the only exchange then
trading options). One such recommendation called for a common national clearing system. In declaring the Amex option
plan effective, which authorized the initiation of multiple-exchange
option trading,
the Commission noted and approved the
joint establishment by the Amex and the
CBOE of the Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC")
to Implement a national
clearing system for all exchange-listed
optlons.ss All exchange-traded
options
were thereafter issued, guaranteed and
registered by the OCC in compliance with
federal securities
laws. Moreover, the
OCC currently
clears
and settles all
option transactions effected In exchange
traded options, now also including those
on the PBW, and it will perform the same
tuncnons
for those exchanges
which
may later initiate options programs and
become partlcipants in OCC.
Another recommended prerequisite to
multiple-exchange trading of options was
the achievement of a common tape for
reporting transactions in all listed options.
In response, the exchanges concerned
set up a policy-making body, the Options
Price Reporting Authority ("OPRA"), to
coordinate
the establishment
and ongOing administration of a separate common options
tape
on the floor
of
exchanges trading options and after a
trial period, If econormcal, to offer access to the tape to subscnbers, OPRA
also administers
orssermnanon of last
sales data concerning options from the
participating
exchanges to vendors of
automated interrogation
devlces.46 FurIn response
to Oornrrussron
thermore,
staff recommendations, all the parnclpat-

Ing exchanges have agreed to make option quotations
available
through
the
vendors to qualified non-members as well
as to their own members
and have
reached
general
agreement
regarding
standardization
of terms of exchangetraded options
These actions have all
been approved by the Comrmssron.s?

Uniform Net Capital Rule
On June 26, 1975,48 the Commission
announced the adoption of a Uniform net
capital
rule, Securities
Exchange
Act
Rule 15c3-1 , effective September 1,1975,
subject to transitional
provisions which
delay the effective date of certain provrsrons until January 1, 1976. The adoption of the rule followed consideration of
comments received In response to a release In. which the proposed rule had
been re-published for comment 49
The new rule discontinues the exemption previously embodied In the net capital rule for members of designated national secuntres exchanges (other than
certain specialists),
required to comply
With net capital rules of such exchanges
In order to ease the transition to a uniform net capital rule, the Commission
Incorporated provrsrons from superseded
capital rules of national securities exchanges. These Include the concepts of
secured
demand
note capital
and a
modified
flow-through
of capital
from
subsidiaries.
The rule, as adopted, continues the
basic net capital concept under which the
securities Industry has operated for many
years and, in addition, Introduces an alternative concept to measure the capital
adequacy
of broker-dealers.
The approaches to capital adequacy and nnanciat responsibility
embodied In the rule
are designed to balance the need for
flexible and efficient use of the fmancral
resources of the securities Industry.

Development of a Uniform
Broker-Dealer
Reporting System
Recognizing

the

need

to

eliminate

duplicative
and otherwise
unnecessary
reporting and regulatory requirements for
broker-dealers, the Commission has been
working on the development of a uniform
reporting and regulatory system to achieve
began its
that goal. The Comrnrsston
study of the problem in September of
1972, when it created an Advisory Committee on Broker-Dealer
Reports and
Registration Requirements to review the
existing reporting and regulatory requirements of the brokerage industry and to
Identify those requirements
that were
unnecessary,
duplicative
or
unduly
burdensome.
After a Commission Staff Task Force
reviewed the recommendations
of the
Advisory
Committee,
the Commission
Issued a release In January 1974 announcmq a program to Implement Virtually
all the proposals contained In the Advisory Committee's Report.5o
The Commission's
program,
as announced by the January 1974 release,
Included the totlowmq measures:
Key Regulatory
Report. The Comrnlsston
undertook
to devise a key
regulatory report, a Uniform reporting
form Unifying and Simplifying the reporting requirements. The Oomrmsston
anticipated
that the report would be
the foundation of the reporting system
and would Incorporate the concept of
layering, whereby greater Increments
of detail are required as the scope and
complexity of a broker-dealer's
operations Increase
Proposed Rule 17a-18. In order to
formulate
methods of Simplifying the
reporting requirements and to develop
the key regulatory
report, the Commission thought It essential to have In
its possession and subject to ItS review
all reports, forms, questionnaires
and
Similar reporting documents required
of broker-dealers.
The self-regulatory
organizations
agreed to supply all reports, forms and questionnaires then In
use, many of which had already been
supplied to the Commission. In order
to provide a formal structure for the
submission of new forms, reports and
questionnaires
or substantive
mooui-

17

cations
of exisnnq ones thereafter
proposed, the Commission published
proposed Rule 17a-18. Proposed Rule
17a-18 would require every national
securities exchange and every registered national secuntres association to
fIle with the Oornrrnsston each proposed
new form, report, questionnaire,
or
similar document or any substantive
amendment to or substantive modification of an exrstinq form which It
requires of ItS members or any class of
members, whether on a regular, onetime, or "for-cause" basis.
Rule 17a-19. The Commission has
proposed
Securities
Exchange
Act
Rule 17a-19 and related Form X-17A19 In order to eliminate duplicative
exarnlnanon of and reporting by brokerdealers about their financial responsibility and related record keeping where
they change their membership status
thereby affecting the relationship with
their desrqnated examining
authonty
or any other self-regulatory
orqarnzanon The proposed rule would require
each national securities exchange and
each
registered
national
secunnes
assocranon promptly upon the happening of certain changes in the membership status of any of ItS members or
upon learning that such changes would
occur to file Form X-17A-19 With the
Commission and the Securities Investor
Protection Oorporatron ("SIPC").
Formation of the Report Coordinating
Group. The Commission Intended to
submit the filings received pursuant to
Rule 17a-18, If adopted, and other
forms and reports to a Report Coordiunder
the
nating
Group organized
Federal Advisory Committee AcP' The
Report Coordinating Group, formed In
May 1974,52 divrdeo their responsibilities Into four work areas. uniform
tmancral/operatronar
forms,
uniform
trading
forms,
urutorrn
assessment
forms and uniform reqrstranon forms
The function of this Group was to review such forms, reports and questionnaires, and to provide expert advice to
the Oomrmssron on such matters as
uruformrty of definitions
and reporting
formats, the extent of the anticipated
18

administrative
burden to be caused by
any new form, and such other matters as
might be appropriate to a program designed to streamline, unify and improve
the quality of the reporting system. The
Group was to advise the Commission as
to areas where unnecessary or duplicative
reports
could
appropriately
be
eliminated. In additron, the Group was to
advise the Cornmlssron on the development of a uniform state, federal, and
Industry form for the reqrstratlon
of
broker-dealers and a uniform registration
form for pnncipals and agents. The Group
was also to be asked at a later date to
assist In development of the proposed
key regulatory report.
In August 1974, the Commission announced ItS approval of a preliminary
outline of a Ftnanctal and Operational
Combined Urutorrn Single Report (FOCUS
Report) and issued it for public comment.
It also announced the adoption of Rule
17a-18, Rule 17a-19 and Form X-17A-

19.53
The Group Issued for publrc comment a
DISCUSSIonPaper In October 1974, containing the pnncrples and an outline of
the contents of a FOCUS Report.54 In
December, the Group presented to the
Comnussron ItS Interim Report, containIng several
interim
recommendations
from each of the four working subcornmlttees.55 PubliC comments
were received on the December Report and were
reviewed by the Group. The Group's
First Annual Report to the Ccmmtssron
In June,
197556 was Issued for public
comment 57 Several recommendations of
the Group, set forth In ItS First Annual
Report, were summarized
in the June
1975 release as follows:
Financial and Operational Reports. The
Report made specific recornrnendatrons
for the adoption of a FOCUS Report of
financial and operational information.
Assessment Forms and Procedures. In
the area of assessment forms, the Group
recommended, among other things, that
each regulatory organization
study the
posarbrlrty
of eliminating
assessment
forms based on net cornmrssron revenue
and consider
collecting
assessments
based on data captured at the source

through the clearing mechanism of each
respective
exchange.
An Assessments
Form Task Force has been created.
RegistratIon
Forms. The Group's recommendation that Form lJ-3, the uniform
broker-dealer
registration
form,
and
Form lJ-4, the uniform agent registration
form, be adopted has been largely implemented.
Forty-five
states, the Commission, and the NASD have adopted the
recommended
uniform
broker-dealer
registration
form; and forty-eight states,
the Commission,
all registered
national
securities
exchanges,
the NASD, and
certain
commodity
exchanges
have
adopted the recommended uniform agent
registration form.
Trading Forms. The Group has ascertained that there are 104 exrstrnq trading
forms which could be reduced to 29 such
forms.
The Commission believes that significant progress has been made In developIng a Uniform, ettlcient, streamlined and
thorough reporting system.

Broker-Dealer Model
Compliance Guide
In October 1972 the Commission established the Broker-Dealer
Model Compliance Program Advisory Committee to
advise the Commission
concerning
the
development
of a model
compliance
program to serve as an Industry gUide for
the broker-dealer cornrnuruty.w
The Committee
completed
the first
draft of ItS report In the form of a GUide
to Broker-Dealer
Compliance
In January
1974. Approximately
2,500 copies of the
draft were distributed to the publrc and
comments were sollcrted The Committee
reviewed
all comments
received, consrdered the recommendations
contained
therein and completed the final revised
draft In October 1974.
The Committee submitted the final draft
of the Guide to the Commission
In
November 1974.59 The Commission distributed over 1,400 copies of trus draft
for the purpose of solrcrtlnq public comment. The Committee's
charter expired
on December 31, 1974.
In ItS recommendations
to the Com-

mission, the Committee ernphasrzed the
benefits of the Industry-regulator
dialogue
which took place In the development of
the Guide. The Committee supported and
urged the continuation
and expansion of
ItS cooperative efforts In order to provide
the Industry With a better understanding
of the Commission's views and the Commrssron with a better understanding
of
the Industry's problems. The Committee
also stressed the need for the GUide to
be updated on a fairly frequent basis In
order for It to retain Its usefulness. To
that end, the Committee recommended
that the Commission appoint a standing
committee which would be responsible
for regular and periodic updating of the
Guide 60
In response to the Commission's
directive that the aim of the Committee's
recommendations
should be "to educate
broker-dealers
as to existmq
requirements and how they may comply With
them," the GUide has been designed to
Inform
management
and
supervisory
personnel In the secuntres Industry of
requtatory requirements.
to
applicable
Identify
special
compliance
problems,
and to suggest procedures for acruevmq
compliance.
The public
comments,
on balance,
concluded that the GUide fulfills ItS general purpose Favorable comments have
also been received from members of the
Congress. In other subrnlssrons, one accounting firm and two law firms wrote to
express their opinion that the GUide IS
an extremely useful tool for the brokerage
community.

DISCLOSURE
MATTERS

RELATED

Beneficial Ownership

V'On September 9,1974, the Commission
announced
that it had ordered
public
hearings to ascertain facts, conditions,
practices and other matters relating to
benencrat

and
acqursmons
by foreign
and domestic
persons in light of the statutory purposes
underlying the Securities Act and the Ex19

change Act, particularly certain amendments to the Exchange Act which were
enacted In 1968 and 1970 ("the Williams
Act"). The purpose of the inquiry was to

whether It was necessary or appropnate
In the public Interest or for the protection
of Investors to adopt or amend rules or
to recommend further legislation to the
Congress with respect to these areas.

Annual Reports to Security
Holders
Based In part on the Industrial Issuers
Advisory Report,"2 the Cornrmssron pro20

posed amendments to ItS proxy rules In
1974 in order to Improve the disclosure
10, and disserrunanon of, annual reports
to security holders and to Improve the
dissemination of annual reports filed with
the Oomrnrssron on Forms 1D-K or 12-K.63
The Commission received 165 letters of
comment
from
Interested
persons
regarding these proposals
On October 31, 1974, the Cornmrssron
amended Rules 14~3 and 140-3 under
the Securines Exchange Act of 193464 to
requrre that annual reports
to security
holders con tam at least the followmg intormatron: certrfred financial statements
for the last two fiscal years, a summary
of operations for the last five fiscal years
and management's analysts of the summary With specrat attention to Significant
changes occurring during the most recent three years, a brief descnptlon of
the company's busmess WhICh, In the
opinion of management, indicates the
general nature and scope of the company's business:
a nne of busmess
breakdown
of total revenues and of
Income (or loss) before mcome taxes and
extraordinary Items for the last nve fiscal
years; the name and prmcrpal occupation
or employment
of each director
and
executive officer of the company, and the
market price ranges and drvidends paid
for each quarterly period during the last
two fiscal years With respect to each
class of equity secuntres entitled to vote
at the company's annual meetmg.
In addrtron, the new rules require that
annual reports to security holders, or the
proxy statement, must contam an undertakrng that the company will provide,
without charge, to any security holder
as of the record date, upon written request, a copy of the company's Form
1D-K or 12-K annual report, except for
the exrubrts thereto, as filed wllh the
Cornmrssron. Companies must also undertake to make copies of the exhibits to
their Form 1D-K or 12-K available, but
companies may Impose a fee limited to
their reasonable expenses for providmq
such copies. Fmally, these companies
wIll be required. to contact known record
holders. such as brokers, banks and their
nommees, who may be reasonably ex-

pected to hold secunnes
on behalf of
beneficial owners; to inquire of them as
to the number of sets of material needed
for distribution
to beneficial owners for
whom they hold securities;
to furnish
the material to them; and to pay the
reasonable expenses of the record holders for distributing
the material to the
beneficial owners

Projections
On April 28, 1975 the Commission
pubhshed for comment a series of rule
and form proposals Intended to Implement
the "Statement by the Commission on the
Disclosure of Projections of Future Ecoproposals
nomic
Peformance" .65 The
would require the filing of Form 8-K to
disclose changes in control of a registrant and certain projections
within 10
days of such events.66 The proposed rules
would define a "prolectron"
under both
Acts to be a statement made by an Issuer
regarding material future revenues, sales,
net income or earnings per share of such
Issuer, expressed as a specrtic amount,
range of amounts or percentage variation
from a specific amount, or a confirmation
by an Issuer of any such statement made
by another person. Proposed rules would
require a filing of a report on Form 8-K
within 10 days of the time a registrant
has furnished a projection to any person,
with certain exceptions including private
financing,
preliminary
negotiations
with
underwriters, business combinations and
government
agencies
which
have afforded non-public treatment to the projections. A report on Form 8-K would
also be required when the registrant has
reason to believe Its publrc projections
no longer have a reasonable basts, or the
registrant has ceased drsclosrnq or revisIng projections
A report on Form 8-K
could also be filed, at the registrant's
option,
If the registrant
disassociated
Itself from another person's projections
However, the registrant
would not be
required by any of the proposals to disassociate Itself from a projection made
by another person.
Proposed amendments to Form 1o-K
under the Exchange Act and Forms &-1,

&-7, &-8, &-9 and &-14 under the Secunties Act would require the registrant
to furnish in the report or registration
statement those projecllons
previously
filed or required to be filed with the Comrrussron covering
the year-end results
for the registrant's
last fiscal year, together with comparisons with correspondresults. The registration
Ing hrstoncal
statements would also Include any projections for the registrant's current fiscal
year and/or future periods If they had
been filed or were required to have been
filed. Any registrant that had made projections for ItS last or current fiscal year
or for any future period, which were filed
or were required to be filed, would be
required to Include In lis annual report
on Form 1o-K projections for at least
the first six months of the current fiscal
year, or for the full fiscal year, or to explain why It had determined to cease
drsctosmq
projections.
The proposals
would permit a registrant to commence
disclosmq projections In the annual report or registration
statement only If
(1) the registrant had a history of filing
under the Exchange Act and budgeting
experience for at least three years, and
(2) the projections and related disclosures
met certain standards.
To alleviate the concerns of registrants
over the possrble liability for dlsclosmq
projections,
proposals under both Acts
would define the criteria under which a
projection shall be deemed not to be an
untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or a manipulative, deceptive or
fraudulent
device, contrivance,
act or
practice as those terms are used in the
various liability provrsrons of the federal
securities laws. In general, these proposed rules
would
establish
certain
criteria for the Issuer of secunties to
which the prolecnon pertains and to the
projection rtselt The Issuer criteria relate
to reporting and budgeting experience
and the projection
Criteria relate generally to ItS preparation, form and manner
of disclosure,
and possible review by
persons other than officers, directors or
employees of the Issuer
Proposed amendments to Rules 14a-3
and 14cr3 under the Exchange Act would
21

require that all projection
information,
other than exhibits, contained
10 the
registrant's report on Form lO-K be 10eluded 10 the registrant's annual report
to security holders. Ftnally, a proposed
amendment to the note to Rule 14a-9
under the Exchange Act would delete the
word "earn rnqs" from paragraph (a) of
the note which presently refers to predictions of earnings as possibly rrusleadrnq
In certain situations.

The Rule 140 Series
In the Commission's 1969 Disclosure
Policy Study 67 a number of recommendalions were made to Improve the overall
disclosure
process and promote objectivity 10 the operation, adrnmistration
and enforcement of certain provrsrons of
the Securities Act. The princrpal recommendatrons of the Study are embodied 10
a series of Commission rules known as
the "Rule 140 Series", comprised of
Rules 144, 145, 146 and 147, adopted
pursuant to the Securrtles Act. Rules 144
and 145 were adopted 10 1972 and 1973,
respectively; 6" and Rules 146 and 147
were adopted 10 1974.69

Rule 144
Rule 144, "Persons Deemed Not to be
Engaged 10 a Distribution and Therefore
Not Underwriters,"
provides a method
of resale of securilles acquired 10 private
placements and for secuntres held by
affiliates During the fiscal year, the Commission's staff has monitored the application of the rule. Also, an amendment
to Rule 144 was adopted to specify that
secuntres sold pursuant to new Rule 240
would be deemed to be "restricted
secunties"
for the purpose of Rule 144
and COUld, therefore, be resold pursuant
to Its provisions 70 Rule 240 provides
exemptions from reqrstratron of secunnes
rnvolvmq certain limited offers and sales
by closely held Issuers

Rule 145
Rule 145, generally, provides that an
"offer" or "sale" of secuntres is deemed
22

to be involved when there IS submitted
for the vote or consent of security holders a plan or agreement for (1) reclassifications
other than stock splits and
10 par
value; (2) mergers,
changes
consolidations and similar plans of acquisltron except where the sole purpose
of such a transacllon IS to change an
and (3) certain transIssuer's dcrrucrle:
fers of assets for securities where there
IS a subsequent distribution
of such
securities to those voting on the transfer
of assets. On July 2, 1974, the Commission published a second mterprettve release reqardrnq
the registration procedures applicable to open-end rnvestrnent
companies issuing securities 10 business
cornbinanon
transactions
subject
to
Rule 134.71

Rule 146
The so-called "private
ottennq"
exemption from registration under the Secunnes Act, Section 4(2), provides that
offers and sales by an Issuer not 10volvrnq any public offering will be exempt
from registration. The section has long
been a source of uncertainty for Issuers
wantmq to sell their secunnes in private
placements. In April 1974, the Commissron adopted Rule 146 under the Securities Act, "Transactrons
by an Issuer
Deemed Not to Involve Any Public Offer109," which IS desrqned to protect 10vestors while at the same time provldrnq
more objective standards to curtail uncertainty as to the meaning of Section
4(2) to the extent feaslble.72
In general, the rule provides that transactions by an Issuer rneetrnq all the condmons of the rule do not rnvolve "any
public offering." Major conditions to be
met are essenllally that (1) there must be
no general advertising or sotlcrtatron 10
connection with the offering; (2) offers
can be made only to persons the Issuer
reasonably beheves have the raquisrte
knowledge and experience in nnancrat
and business matters, or can bear the
economic risk; (3) sales can be made
only to persons the Issuer reasonably believes have the reqursrte knowledge and
experience, or who can bear the economic

risk and have an advisor (meeting certain standards)
who can provide the
raqursrta
knowledge
and experience;
(4) all offerees either must have access
to or must be furnished with the type of
information
that registration
would disclose; (5) there can be no more than 35
purchasers of securities in the offering;
and (6) reasonable care must be taken to
prevent resale of the secuntres In Violation of the registration provisrons of the
Securities Act
Rule 146 does not provide the exclusive means for offering and seiling securities In reliance on Section 4(2). Issuers
may continue to rely on the Section 4(2)
exemption
by complying
With relevant
administrative and judicral criteria at the
time of a transaction. The staff of the
Commission
will
Issue
interpretative
letters to assist persons in complying
With the rule, but will issue no-action
letters relating to Section 4(2) only In the
most compelling circumstances
In June 1975, the Commission amended
Rule 146 to clarify, and in some Instances
to modify, paragraph
(c) of the rule,
"limitations
on Manner
of Offering;"
paragraph (e) of the rule, "Access to or
Furnishing
of
Information"
for
nonreporting companies; paragraph (f) of the
rule,
"Business
Combinations,"
and
paragraph (g) of the rule, "Number of
Purchasers." The purpose of the amendments IS to decrease burdens on issuers
In complying
with the rule, consistent
with Section 4(2) of the Act and the protection of Investors.

Rule 147
Section 3(a)(11) of the Secunties Act,
the Intrastate offering exemption, which
exempts from registration secunnes that
are part of an issue offered and sold only
to persons resident In a specrnc state by
an Issuer that is also resident and doing
business In that state, has been widely
relied upon, but has also been the source
of inquiry, misunderstanding,
and uncertainty over the years On January 7, 1974,
the Commission adopted Rule 147 under
the Securities Act which defines certain
terms In, and clarifies certain conditions

of, the Intrastate offering exemptlOn.73
The rule provides some objective standards for determining when a person IS
considered a resident Within a state and
whether an issuer IS "doing
business
within" a state for purposes of the exemption The rule does not define which offers
and sales constitute "part of an Issue"
but relies
instead
on the traditional
understanding
of when offers and sales
Will be Integrated, It does, however, proVide a "safe harbor" as to certain offers
and sales. The rule benefits only Issuers
Since the adoption of Rule 147, the staff
of the Commission has ceased respondIng to requests for no-action letters under
Section 3(a)(11) except In the most compelling circumstances;
but the staff does
provrde Interpretative guidance as to the
use of the Rule.

Adoption of Rule 240
On January 24, 1975, the Commission
adopted Rule 240 (and related Form 240),
"Exemption of Certain Limited Offers and
Sales by Closely Held Issuers," which
exempts
from
registration
under the
Securities Act limited offers and sales of
small dollar amounts of securities by an
Issuer, that, after the transactions
pursuant to the rule, would continue to have
a small number of benencral owners of ItS
securities 74 The rule was adopted pursuant to Section 3(b) of the Act. The
Rule IS not available for resales.
In general, the rule exempts transactions by an Issuer (other than an investment company) where (a) there IS no
general advertising or solrcrtanon: (b) no
cornrrussron or Similar remuneration
IS
paid for soncrtlnq prospective buyers or
In connection With the sales; (c) the aggregate sales price of unregistered securities of the Issuer sold by the issuer IS
not more than $100,000 In the preceding
twelve months; (d) the securities of the
Issuer are beneficially owned, before and
after the transaction,
by 100 or fewer
persons, and (e) the Issuer Informs the
purchasers of restrictions on resale In
addition, the Issuer IS required to file a
notice of sales on Form 240. However,
the exemption provided by the rule would
23

be available for up to $100,000 of securities sold In transacnons complying with
all the conditions of the rule other than
the notice requirement, In connection
with the rule, the Commission adopted an
amendment to Rule 144 that makes that
rule available for securities acquired In a
Rule 240 transaction

Disclosure of Oil and Gas
Reserves
On May 30, 1975, the Oornrmssron pubhshed for comment proposed amendments to Forms &-1 and &-7 under the
Securities Act and to Forms 10 and 1o-K
under the Exchange Act to require the
disclosure of 011 and gas reserves and to
provide definitions and classifications of
the term "reserves." 70 In general, these
proposals would make explrcrt the dISclosures WIth respect to 011 and gas reserves already required
under Forms
&-1, &-7 and 10 and, for the first nrne,
require such disclosures to be made on
an annual baSIS In a report on Form 1o-K.
In connection With the proposed amendment to Form 1o-K, GUide 2 under the
Exchange Act which relates to disclosure
of natural gas reserves would also be
amended to make It applicable to reserves disclosed In a report on Form
1o-K. The staff is now considering the
comments received on these proposals.

Coordination with the Federal
Power Commission on Filings
Which Include Natural Gas
Reserve Estimates
In early 1974, the Oornrrusston
announced that It will request registrants to
explain differences between natural gas
reserve estimates contained
In filings
With trus Commission and estimates reported to any other regulatory authority
Within one year prior to the filing. In addrnon, copies of prospectuses filed by registrants SUbject to the Federal Power
Commission would be submitted to that
agency for comments and, generally,
appropriate technical personnel from the
FPC would be invited to attend conferences where supplemental natural gas
24

reserve mtorrnatron submitted by a regIstrant IS revlewed!6
The Commission
refined the above
procedures In announcing new steps to
by the DIVISion
be taken for coordmation
of Corporation Finance With the FPC In
connection
With the review of fIlings
which Include natural gas reserve estimates. The Oornrrussron stated that the
DIVISion had been authonzed to provide
copies of letters of comments on filings,
which Include natural gas reserve estimates, and any written responses and
communications
In connection therewitn
to the FPC, with the understanding that
they Will remain non-publrc unless the
Commlssron determines otherwise!7

Gold Purchasing and Investing
On December 31, 1974, the restrictions
on the purchase, sale and ownership of
gold by American Citizens Imposed In
1933 by the Federal government were
lifted In response thereto, the comrmssion took two steps desiqned to gUide the
acnvines of both purchasers and sellers
of gold and gold-related securities In this
new Investment area. First, because investment In and the purchase of gold IS a
potentially fertile area for unscrupulous
promoters and fraudulent schemes, the
Cornrrussron together With the President's
Special ASSistant for Consumer Affairs,
the Department of Justice, the Federal
Trade Commission and the U.S. Postal
Inspection
Service
suggested
certain
gUidelines to be followed In purchasmq
or investing In gold!" These gUidelines
stressed caution In purchasrnq gold and
care In selection of seller, and advised
potential investors of the information they
should seek concerning
the program
through which the gold was being offered
In order to assure themselves of all facts
necessary to make a reasoned investment decrsion
Secondly, the Commission announced
the adoption by the DIVISion of Corporanon Finance of a no-action position with
respect to the appucaburty of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 to gold Investment programs meetIng certain cntena.?v

It was Indicated that the Divisron would
take a no-action positron where (1) It did
not appear that the economic benefits to
the purchaser were derived from the
managerial efforts of the seller, promoter
or a third party, and (2) where those
services
being offered
in connection
with the gold program did not appear to
rise to the level of being the essential
managerial efforts upon which the purchaser must rely in order to make a profit
from his purchase. The release indicated
that among the facts considered In concluding that the services provided did not
rise to the level of being the essential
managerial efforts were that the purchaser pay full value In cash and not
purchase on margin; that any depository
arrangement be limited to the storage of
the gold with a reputable facility, insurance against loss or theft from the storage facility, and the Issuance of a document which would evidence the right of
the purchaser or his successors and assigns to take possession of the gold; and
that the seller have no obliqatron to repurchase the gold or ownership documents from the purchaser, nor to sell
such gold or ownership for the purchaser's account.

Possible Disclosure of
Environmental and Other Socially
Significant Matters
V""0n February 11, 1975, the Commission
announced a public proceeding, rncludIng public hearings, concerning possible
disclosure In registration statements and
other documents filed with the Commission or furnished to Investors of information bearing on corporate environmental
practices or other matters of primarily
social rather than financial concern.w The
primary objective of this proceeding was
to permit the Commission to determine,
with the benefit of comment from interested persons, what, If any, rnodrflcations
In the Commission's disclosure requirements are appropriate
in light of the
provisions of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) 81 In addition, the Commission sought to determine the desirability of amending ItS disclosure require-

ments with regard to corporate equal
employment
practices
and any other
matters of social significance.
Thrs proceeding was initiated pursuant
to the order and opinion of Judge Charles
R. Richey In Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc. v. Securtttes and Exchange
Commtseion r? That action arose from the
Commission's
denial of a rulernakrnq
petition submitted by Natural Resources
Defense Councrl (NRDC) which would
have required reporting companies to file
with the Oomrnlssron information
concerning the effects of corporate actrvmes
on the environment, and statlstrcs reflecting equal employment practices. The
Commission
subsequently
proposed 83
and Issued 84 more limited environmental
disclosure rules wrnch, NRDC alleged,
failed to fulfill the Commission's responsrbrlrtres under NEPA. Plaintiffs
also
alleged that the Commission, In denying
the petition and promulgating
ItS own
disclosure requirements, had not compiled with the requirements of the Adminrstratrve Procedure Act (APA)
The court held that the Commission
had Inadequately Informed the public that
ItS proposed requlattons were Intended to
satisfy fully the Commission's mandate
under NEPA and that It had not provided
a proper statement of the basis and purpose for ItS rulernakmq action. Further,
the court held that the Commission failed
to articulate adequately the reasons for
denial of the equal employment portion
of the NRDC petitron. Accordingly, Judge
Richey remanded the matter to the Commission for further rulernakinq action,
and expressly ordered the Commission
to determine the extent of "ethical investor" Interest In environmental and equal
employment information, and the avenues
of action which such Investors may pursue to eliminate
corporate
practices
Inimical to the environment and equal

ernployrnent.w
While the Commission did not agree
with Judge Richey that It had failed to
satisfy the procedural requrrernents of
the APA, It has attempted to comply tully
With hrs order In response to the notice
announcmq the proceeding, the Commission received over 350 written comments
25

In addition, at the public heanngs conducted dunng Apnl and May, 1975, testimony was received from 54 witnesses.
The documents compiled In the proceedIng exceed 10,000 pages. The particrpants
included
public

and
individual
Investors,
special Interest groups, state and federal
legislators,
representatives
of the accounting
and legal
professions,

declining to promulgate rules requiring
specific disclosure of other social matters Hb

MUTUAL FUND DISTRIBUTION
In November 1974, the Commission
announced a comprehensive program to
revise the laws and regulations affecting
Its program
mutual fund drstnbutron.r'?
was based upon a report of the DIvision
of Investment Management Regulation on
"Mutual Fund Dtstnbution
and Section
22(d) of the Investment Company Act of
1940" ("Staff Report") In transmitting the
Staff Report, the Commission stated that
ItS program was "Intended to reduce or
eliminate many of the inequities and mettrcrencies of the present fund drstnbutron
system while, at the same time, avordrnp
the dangers of a sudden abolition of retail price maintenance." The Commission
added
that ItS plan was to "Iay the
groundwork for the gradual and orderly
introduction
of retail pnce competition
Into the mutual fund distribution
system" MM
The Commission's three-fold program
Involved: (1) Increased use of Its exrstrnq
administrative
powers to permit greater
pnce fleXibility and Improved communication with Investors; (2) a recommendation
that Congress enact legislation to expand
the Commission's authority to select from
a broad vanety of long-range options to
remove mhrbrnons on competition In the
future; and (3) the adoption of proposed
rules by the NASD to prevent excessive
sales loads, as a regulatory safeguard
The Commission's program utilizes ItS
26

exrstlnq
administrative
authority to encourage
(a) Improved
communication
With investors through expanded fund
advertrsrnq
and more Informative
portrayal of fund Investment results and (b)
voluntary pnce competition
by permitting
greater
opportunities
for
massmerchandising and more pnce vanatrons
In the current sales load structure.
1. Improved commumceuon
With Investors
The Commission adopted amendments
to Rule 134 under the Securities Act of
1933,M9 which expand the scope of matenal permitted
in Investment company
advertisements and which also emphasize
the Importance of the prospectus to potential Investors. As amended, Rule 134
permits registered Investment companies
to Include
In their advertisements
a
descnption of their Investment objectives,
pohcies, services, and method of operation,
pictorial
illustrations
which
are
appropnate for Inclusion In the company's
prospectus and not Involving performance
figures; and descnptive matenal relating
to economic conditions, or to retirement
plans, or other goals to which an investment In the company could be directed,
but not directly or indirectly relating to
past performance or implying achievement of investment objectives. However, a
legend calling attention to the company's
prospectus must be Included In advertisements containing such newly permitted
information
The liberalized rule should
foster more interesting and informative
fund advertisements and may encourage
Investment companies to devote more of
their promotional budgets to mass media
These amendments are the fourth in a
senes of Commission efforts designed to
allow a Wider degree of advertising by investment companies which Issue redeemable secunties.
Rule 134 adopted
In
195590 was amended In 197291 to permit
a general dsscnptron of an Investment
company. At the same time the Commrssion adopted Rule 135A 92 expanding investment company genenc advertising
and Rule 434(a) to permit investment
companies to use a summary prospectus
The Commission
also published for

comment a proposed amendment to the
Statement of Policy under the Securities
Act of 193393 wruch, If adopted, would
permit use of four new types of performance charts thereby giving mutual funds
and variable annuities the opportunity to
portray past Investment results in terms of
compound rates of total return (assuming
dividends
and capital gains are reinvested). These charts would also incorporate
such
features
as
standard
compansons with the Standard & Poor's
500, serrn-loqanthrruc presentations, and
the Illustration of the Investment results
from market highs to market lows. The
proposed charts are designed to help
Investors to understand better the returns, nsks and expenses of mutual fund
and vanable annuity Investments and to
among the vanous
make comparisons
funds and annuities offered. At year end,
the comments on the proposal were being
analyzed by the staff.
2. Price Competition at the Underwriter
Level
The Comrnlssron adopted amendments
to Rule 22d-1 94 which permit funds, at
their option, to provide the benefit of
sales load discounts to certain additional
groups of persons. To be eligible under
one of the amendments, a group must
have been In existence for at least SIX
months, have a purpose other than purchasing mutual fund shares at a discount,
and must satisfy other cntena selected
by the fund relating to the realization by
the fund of economies of scale In sales
effort and sales related expense. These
amendments
enable
funds
and their
underwnters to Introduce mass-marketing
techniques and to pass on to Investors
economies of scale and cost savings
from group sales.
As part of the program, the Oommrssion
published for comment proposed Rule
22d-4, an exemptive rule which would
permit a fund and ItS underwnter
to
utilize "open seasons" dunng which persons who have held shares of the fund
for a specified penod of time could purchase specified
amounts of additional
shares at a reduced sales load or at no
load.95 Thrs was designed to enable cost

savings to be passed on to qualifying
fund shareholders who make additional
Investments.
The Commission also encouraged applications
for exemption from Section
22(d) to permit sales load reductions to
persons who have previously or contemporaneously purchased another investment product or an Insurance product,
distributed by the same underwnter. Such
exemptions would permit funds to pass
on to Investors the cost savings from
marketing
several
financial
products
dunng one sales effort, and would also
permit underwnters to expenment With
vaned financial packages.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal
year, the Commission
adopted
Rule
22d-3,96 which provides a conditional
exemption from Section 22(d) to permit
variations of the sales load and certain
other deductions from purchase payments
for variable annuities, based upon differences In costs or services. Such pnce
vanatrons would be subject to the conditions that the prospectus disclose the
amount of the vanations and the circumstances in which such variations
are
available, or describe the basis for such
variations and the manner In which entitlement shall be determined, and that
any vanations reflect differences In costs
or services and do not unfairly discnrnrnate against any person.
3. Price Competition at the Retail Level
The Commission has also authorized
its staff, on an expenmental basis, to view
favorably interpretive
requests With respect to proposals that brokers which act
Independently of funds and their underwnters be permitted, under certain circumstances, to charge reasonable fees
for services rendered in connection with
the purchase of shares of "no-load"
funds. The staff has taken a "no-action"
POSition based upon the tollowrnq
safeguards being met In connection With the
Imposition of such a service fee'
(1) the broker must not be an affiliated
person of the fund, Its Investment
advrser
or prrncipal underwnter
and have no formal or Informal
agreement With the fund, its In27

1i

1t

vestment adviser or principal
underwriter
to
distribute
its
shares;
(2) the fund 	must not enoourage brokers to make such a charge or
give any special treatment to
orders received through brokers:
(3) the fact that such a charge may be
made must be disclosed in the
fund's prospectus;
(4) 	the prospectus must make clear
that it the shares are purchased
directly from the fund without the
intervention of a broker, there will
be no charge; and
(5) any 	 broker who makes such a
charge must inform his customer.
In writing, that the shares could
be purchased directly from the
fund at no load.
interpretations are being issued as requests are received.
Though the restrictions of Section 22(d)
do not apply to sales of fund shares by
one person to another through a broker,
no secondary brokerage market in mutual
funds has developed. Provisions contained in uniform sales agreements between underwriters and broker-dealers
effectively prohibit such activity.
The Commission has asked the NASD
to;amend its Rules of Fair Practice to
prohibit contractual restrictions which
would prevent broker-dealers from engaging in brokered transactions in fund
shares."' If necessary, the Commission
will alSv consider the adoption of its own
rules pursuant to Section 22(f) under the
lnvestment Company Act to prevent funds
from restricting the transferability of their
shares in a secondary brokered market.
Broker-dealers would not be required to
set u p special procedures to match
orders for fund shares, and it is not
anticipated that such a market will become so significant as to disrupt the
primary distribution system. However, it
will introduce some retail price variations
in the industry and provide some insight
into whether a secondary dealer market
could function effectively.

Variable Life Insurance
In February 1975, the Comm~ss~on
an-

IS

F

28

nounced withdrawal of its proposed
amendments to Rule 3 d under the Invwtment Company Act and Rule 202-1
under the Advisers Act
both of which
concerned regulation of variable life
insurance. The Commission also announced its intention to propose a rule
under Section 6(e) of the lnvestment
Company Act" which would conditionally
exempt certain variable life insurance
Separate accounts from particular sections of the lnvestment Company Act and
the rules thereunder while requiring full
compliance with all other provisions of
this Act and rules. A short time thereafter
the Commission rescinded Rules 30-1
and 202-1, effective July 30. 1975.'0° The
rescission of these exemptive rules will
result in the application of the lnvestment
Company Act and lnvestment Advisers
Act to variable life insurance contracts,
their issuers and related persons until a
new rule is adopted or other relief is
granted.

1


Status of Broker-Dealers
as lnvestment Advisers
AS a result of the elimination of fixed
commission rates on exchange transactions on May 1, 1975, some brokerdealers may elect to charge separately
for investment advisory services which
they had previously provided solely incidentally to their business and without
special compensation. The change to
charging separately for investment advice
would cause such broker-dealers to b*
come "investment advisers" within the
meaning of the lnvestment Advisers Act.
Temporary Rule ZO6A-l(T), adopted by
the Commission prior to May 1, temporarily exempted broker-dealers registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (except broker-dealers already
registered as investment advisers on May
1, 1975) from the provisions of the Advisers Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder from May 1, 1975, until August
31, 1975."" The exemption provided by
the Rule was intended toenable brokerdealers to furnish research and other investment advice for a separate fee for a
period of four months without the need to

I
I

comply with the provisions of the Advisers Act.
A result of charging separately for investment advice was that such brokers
and dealers would be subject to Section
206(3) of the Advisers Act, which makes it
unlawful for an Investment adviser, if he
is acting as such In relation to a particular transaction, to effect the transaction
with or for his client under circumstances
where the adviser acts either as principal,
or as broker for a person other than his
client, unless the adviser furnishes his
client with prior written disclosure of the
capacity in which the adviser is acting
and obtams the client's consent to the
transaction.
On March 31, 1975, the Commission
proposed
the adoption
of new Rule
206(3r--1 under the Act 102 to exempt investment advrssrs who are also registered
With the Commission as broker-dealers
from the disclosure and consent requirements of Section 206(3) of the Act With
respect to certain Investment advisory
services If such advisers comply With the
conditions set forth In the proposed rule.
ThiS rule was adopted substantially unchanged after the close of the fiscal year.

Institutional Disclosure

I

i

j

I

Under the Securities Acts Amendments
of 1975, a new Section 13(f) was added to
the Exchange Act, which provides the
Cornrnissron with authonty
to require
disclosure
and reporting
of securities
holdings and transactions from all types
of msntunonat Investors. As such, the
amendment Implements a recommendation which the Commission had made In
ItS letter transmitting
the Institutional
Investor Study to the Congress In 1971.103
The new section gives the Commission
broad rulernakrnq authonty to determine,
inter alia, the size of the Institutions which
will be required to file reports, the format
and frequency of the reporting requirements, and the Information to be disclosed In each report. The Commission is
also directed to provide for publtc dissemination of the information collected,
subject to confidential treatment In appropriate cases, and IS empowered to

investment manexempt any instrtunonal
ager or security from any or all of the
provrsrons of the section
The reports will provide the Commission with a continual flow of Information,
thereby creating a uniform, centralized
data base With respect to the Investment
activity of large institutions. Among other
things, the Commission and the public
can consider "parallel" institutional trading and related price impacts, block tradIng and direct trading between mstitunons, the Impact of institutional trading
on brokerage
services and functions,
different techniques of valuation of large
secunnes holdings, and managers' practice In the allocation
of Investment
opportunities among their different types
of accounts.

Investment Companies--Sale
Investment Adviser

of

The Securities Acts Amendments of
1975 amended the Investment Company
Act, In part, to clarify the ambiguity created by the decrsion of the Court of Appeals for the Second Olrcuit in Rosenfeld
v. Black.104 In that case, the court held
that the general principle that a fiduciary
cannot sell his office for personal gain IS
Impliedly Incorporated Into Section 15(a)
of the Act, which requires shareholder approval of any new Investment advisory
contract Consequently, a retiring investment adviser of an Investment company
violates the Act by receiving compensation which reflects either (1) a payment
contingent upon the use of Influence to
secure approval of a new adviser or (2) an
assurance of profits for the successor
adviser under a new advisory contract
and renewals. The sweep of the court's
language cast doubt, however, on whether
an Investment adviser, Without incurring
liability to the company or its shareholders, could profit when It sold its
business by sellmg ItS assets.

SIGNIFICANT CASES INVOLVING
SECURITIES ACTS
Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange 105
In this case the Supreme Court affirmed
29

a decision of the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit which had upheld the dismissal of a private antitrust damage action challenging
the fixed commission
rate structures of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock
Exchange (AM EX) as violative
of the
Sherman Act The Court of Appeals had
concluded that exchange rules and practices which prescribe
fixed rates fell
within the exclusive supervisory JUrisdiction of the Commission, and were thus
Immune from antitrust attack 106
The Commission filed a brief amicus
cunee with the Supreme Court In which
It expressed the view that It would be
Impossible for the Commission to exercrse the broad discretionary
Jurisdiction
granted to It under the Securities
Exchange Act to regulate rules and practices
of national securities exchanges In the
public Interest, If ItS decisions, and exchange activities within its JUrisdiction,
could be subjected to simultaneous antitrust attack In federal district courts. The
Commission emphasized that It must and

factors, together with other purposes and potrcres
of the Act, In exercising ItS authority under the Act. In ttus context, the Commisto its regulation

participated
The
amicus curtee In trus case In the Supreme
Court The Court summarily rejected the
argument that the shares were securities
by virtue of their denomination as "stock"

certain of the common features of stock,
such as the right to receive drvidends
contingent
upon an apportionment
of
profits and the ability to be negotiated,
30

pledged or hypothecated. The Court, thus,
reaffirmed the doctrine that whether a
"security"
exists Will not turn upon the
label that an Instrument IS given, but on
the economic realities of the situation.
Regarding the economic reality of the
Situation, the Court was heavily Influenced
by what It believed to be the sole motivation of shareholders
In purchasmq their
shares; namely, the prospect of acquiring
rea place to live and not the tlnancrat
turns on their Investment. In this connection, the Court concluded
that the
various ways by which Investors might
save on their expenses were not the
kinds of profits traditionally
associated
With securities. According to the Court,
those types of profits which would be
relevant to determine whether a security
exists would Include profit "derived from
the income Yielded by an Investment as
well as from capital appreciation."
Since
the shares of stock could not be resold
at a price higher than that which they
were bought, there could be no capital
appreciation.
Although
the commercial
tenants generated Income to the corporation, that Income was found to be too
speculative and insubstantial to bring the
entire
transaction

secunties laws.
In Blue Chip Stamps v, Manor Drug
Stores,109 the Supreme Court, three JUstices dissenting,
upheld the so-called

rule 110 that a person who
neither purchased nor sold securities has
no standing to seek damages for injuries
caused by a violation of Section 10(b) of
the Securities

Untted States v National Assocteuon
of
Securnies Dealers, Inc. III
In thrs Civil injunctive action, the Justice
Department challenged,
as Violative of

the antitrust laws, the activities of various
mutual
funds, fund
underwriters
and
broker-dealer
distributors
of the funds'
shares, which allegedly inhibited the development of a secondary brokerage market In the funds' shares. Specifically,
the Department of Justice alleged (1) that
the funds, underwnters, and dealers contracted among themselves to prohibit the
dealers and underwrrters from engaging
In secondary brokerage transactions
in
the funds' shares at other than the public
offering price of those shares prevailing
In the primary market, and (2) that the
funds, underwrrters, dealers, and the National Association
of Securities Dealers
(NASD) engaged In a conspiracy to restrain the development
of a secondary
brokerage
market In fund shares. The
district court granted defendants' motions
for summary judgment and dismissed the
complaint.
The Department
of Justice
then appealed
to the Supreme Court
under the Expediting Act.
While the Commission did not partrcipate in the district court proceeding, It
filed a brief, emtcus curiae, In the Supreme Court. In that brief, the Commission
urged that the contractual
restrictions
challenged by the Department of Justice,
although not mandated by Section 22(d)
of the Investment Company Act, were
shielded from anti-trust attack because of
the Jurisdiction granted the Commission
In Section 22(f) of that Act to supervise
industry
imposed
restrictions
on the
transferability
and negotiability
of their
shares. The Ocmmisston took no position
with respect to the alleged conspiratorial
activities
of the funds,
underwriters,
dealers, and NASD.
In affirming the district court's dismissal
of the complaints, the Supreme Court, In
accord with the Commission's
position,
held that the contractual provrsion challenged in the complaint was Immune from
antitrust attack, since It was subject to
the supervisory JUrisdiction granted the
Commission In Section 22(f). The Court
also held that the alleged conspiratorial
activity
In the complaint
was in fact
legitimate conduct aimed at the furtherance of the policies underlying Sections
22(d) and 22(f) of the Investment Com-

pany Act and subject to the pervasive
exercise of Commission requlanon under
the Investment Company Act and the
Securities Exchange Act.
In Securtues Investor Protection Corp.
v Barbour, et al.,112 the Supreme Court
reversed a lower court ruling and agreed
with the Commission and SIPC that the
Commission's statutory right to bring an
action under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, to require SIPC to
discharge ItS duties IS exclusive and that
customers have no Similar Implied right
of action The Court also recognized, but
suggestion
left open, the Commissron's
that ItS dscrsron not to institute proceedmqs against SIPC In a particular matter
might
be reviewable
for
abuse
of
discretion.
The case Involved an attempt by the
receiver for a broker-dealer, who was appointed In a Cornmlssion enforcement
proceeding, to compel SIPC to assume
and complete the liqurdatron of the brokerdealer and thereby to make available to
ItS customers the protections of the Act
As previously
described, the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Oircurt had held
that the protections of the Act were available where a broker-dealer,
although
Insolvent prior to the effective date of the
Act, continued to transact a substantial
busmess in secuntres after the Act had
become effective, and that the receiver
had standing to bring an action on behalf of customers of the broker-dealer to
compel
SIPC
to
initiate

proceedings under the Act,l13
Securittes
and Exchange Commission
v.
FIrst Secunttes Co. of Chicago I H
The Commission instituted thrs equity
receivership
action Immediately after It
note left by the
learned of a suicrde
president of the defendant broker-dealer,
First Securities Co. of Chicago, In which
he stated, among other things, that he
had misappropriated
the funds of those
First Securities customers whom he had
Induced to Invest In a special "escrow
account" that he operated as a personal
venture apart from the firm. The Court of
Appeals had held In an earlier opinion
(463 F.2d at 985-988) that First Securities
was liable to the escrow Investors for the
31

president's fraud both because, as the
firm's president, he had acted with apparent authority of First Securities
in
advismq the Investors to lrqurdate their
accounts at the firm and Invest In the
escrow, and because the firm aided and
abetted the president's Violation of Rule
10b-5. Accordingly, the escrow Investors
had a valid claim against the estate of
First Securities.
In this latest appeal, the Court of Appeals held, in accordance With the POSItion urged by the Commission,
that
Section 60(e) of the Bankruptcy
Act,
which governs the distribution of a brokerdealer's assets In a bankruptcy proceeding, was properly applied by the district
court by analogy In this receivership
proceeding because "the same reasons
for the Section 60(e) treatment exist In
Irqurdation
as
the instant stockbroker
Congress must have consrdered
in choosIng to provide specially for stockbroker
bankruptcies."
Section 60(e), the Court
observed, "was Intended to protect, and
secure equality of treatment for, 'the
public customer who has entrusted securmes
to a broker-dealer
for some
purpose connected With participation
In
markets,'''
and the Court
the secuntres
noted that "a considerable portion of the
IFirst Securities] assets on hand represents cash or the proceeds of securities
entrusted to First Securities by customers"
for such a purpose. In support of the
application
of Section 60(e), the Court
also relied upon the "Interest
in UOltorrmty of treatment of Insolvent brokerage
houses," the Court noting that the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970,
enacted after First Securities'
failure,
adopted to a large degree the provisrons
of Section 60(e).
In affirming the lower court's ruling
that the escrow Investors fell Into the
category of general creditors rather than
the higher category of "customers,"
who
are defined In Section 60(e) to include
persons who have claims on account of
secuntres
received, acquired or held by
the stockbroker for the account of such
persons, the Court of Appeals noted that
the Investors' transactions with respect
to the escrow account were "on their
32

face directly with Nay [the president],
personally, and were neither In fact nor
understood to be a deposit of funds
With First Securities."
EqUity Funding Corporation of America
During
1975, Criminal
proceedings
against those Involved in the fraud at
Equity Funding Corporation of America
(Equrty Funding) were successfully completed With the conviction and sentencing
of all 22 persons Indlcted.'15
EqUity
Funding, which has been termed by commentators as the largest financial fraud in
history, pioneered and sold a package
Investment Involving life Insurance and
mutual funds. Over the years it had sold
hundreds of millions of dollars of its secuntles to the publrc and had expanded
through life insurance company and other
acquisrtlons
In exchange for ItS securities
The government alleged a colossal secunnes fraud which lasted and expanded
throughout
almost the entire ten-year
history of the company. In early 1973,
investigation by the staff led to a trading
suspension by the S E.C. and a S.E.C.
complaint seeking an injunction and receiver. Shortly thereafter, the company
went
Into
Chapter
X
proceedings.
Further Investigation
revealed that the
company Inflated its earnings by recording non-existent
receivables. ThiS continued on an increasing scale until the
fraud was discovered. The company also
borrowed millions of dollars without recording the amounts borrowed as liabilities on Its books. The company repaid
these obligations by further undisclosed
borrowings.
The
company
structured
complicated, sham, foreign transactions
to record bogus income and assets.
Beginning in 1969, the company began
the Insurance phase of the fraud by reinsuring Insurance polrcres of questionable
value with other Insurance cornparues.
Thrs generated badly needed cash for
the company and helped It Increase its
reported
sales and insurance-in-force
figures. In 1970, the company started the
outright
creation
of bogus Insurance
polrcres
and the reinsurance of these
pollcres ThiS practice continued and increased until the company collapsed.
Under the company's reinsurance agree-

ments, the company received a significant
cash payment from Its reinsurers at the
time the policies were reinsured. In succeeding years. however. the company was
required to pay to reinsurers the renewal
premiums It received from policyholders.
In the case of the bogus policies. there
were no policyholders
and the company
had to pay these renewal premiums Itself.
The company paid these renewal premiums by reinsuring more bogus policies.
Thus, the company's cash flow and liabiliIn geometric
ties problems
increased
proportions.
In 1972, the company recorded at least $14.667.000 in fictitious
premrurn
income. The company's
last
annual report was for ItS year ended
December
31, 1972. The company's
balance
sheet at that time reported
$737.511,000 in assets of which approximately one-third was fictitious.
In November 1973. as a result of a
coordinated
investigation

Silver and Gold Investments
DUring the year the Cornrnisston filed
several injunctive cases concerning the
sale of Investments In COinS, silver and
silver futures.
On December 12, 1974 the Cornrmsston
filed a lawsurt against Monex International
Ltd., d/b/a Pacific Coast COin Exchange
based upon alleged Violations of the
securities registration and anti-fraud provrsrons of the Federal secuntres
laws In
connection
With margin sales of bulk
snver COinS. The Oomrrussron alleged
that the defendants had made false and
misleading statements concerning
nonexistent purchases, fees for non-existent
services, Investments prospects, and the
firm's comparability With other exchanges.
The defendants
have consented
to a
Temporary Restraining Order.
In ItS first major lawsuit mvolvmq gold
sales the Comrmssron obtained a tem34

porary restraining
order against Brent
Fields, Daniels & Martin, Ltd (an Atlantabased firm Incorporated In England) and
United States BUllion, a wholly-owned
subsrdrary,
based upon violations of the
securities
registration
and
anti-fraud
provrsrons of the Federal securities laws.
The defendants had offered for sale 6,000
ounces of gold worth more than one million dollars when In fact they only had
200 ounces.
With respect to rare COinS, a preliminary injunction
against
Federal COin
Reserve was Issued on February 10, 1975,
based on Violations of the securities
registration provisions In connection With
the sale of rare COin portfohos.t!? The
court noted that, although the portfolios
were advertised by the defendants as
Investments In publications of a general
(vs. numismatic) nature, the defendants
offered a number of servtces, the most
Significant of which was the selection of
the COinS by the sellers, which gave rise
to an Investment contract,
under the
meaning of Section 2(1) of the Securities
Act of 1933. The opinion states that "the
dependence of the Investor on the expertise of the seller to produce the expected profit" was suftrcrent to meet the
Howey tests for Investment contracts. The
court rejected the notion that possession
of the COin portfolios reconverted an investment contract into a commodity. The
fact that Investors were not required to
avail themselves of the proffered services
was declared
irrelevant
inasmuch
as
the terms of the offer, not the acceptance,
determine whether any particular investment vehicle IS a security within the
meaning of the Federal securities laws.
Defendant's
proposition
that none of
its services affected the value of the
COinS and therefore secunnes were not
Involved, was also rejected by the court.
On April 21, 1975 the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission
came Into
existence. The new Cornmtsston, In addition to regulating
commodity
futures,
over margin
has exclusive junsdrctron
and leveraged sales of Silver and gold,
however, Congress specrncally mandated
that pending proceedings
Will be unaffected by the new Commodity Act.
On November 20, 1974, the United

States Attorney for the Middle District of
Florida filed a one-count criminal mtormatron against James E. Tolleson and ExertIng Life, lnc., charging them With wilfully,
and without just cause, failing and refusIng to attend and testify and produce
certain records in obedience to a subpoena duces tecum issued by a Comrrussron
officer
In the
course
of
an
investigation. liB This IS only the second
such action instituted in recent years, and
only the third such case in Commission
history Upon convicnon, the defendants
are subject to a maximum fine of $1,000.00
and up to one year imprisonment.
On March 26, 1975, EXCiting Life, Inc.,
pleaded guilty to the violation as charged
In
the
information
and
was
fined
$1,000.00. On March 11, 1975, the Court
entered an order drsmrssrnj; the Information as to James E Tolleson for lack of
proper service. That order has been appealed by the Government to the Court of
Appeals for the Fifth crrcun and a decrslon on the appeal IS expected dunnq

10 When the Commission
commenced
its Inquiry Into the commission rate structures at the time of the Special Study,
39

fixed comrrusston rates were assumed by
everyone, including
the Commission,
to
be a normal and necessary feature of the
exchange markets
It only became clear
in light of later experience and thorough
study that this was not the case. While
the virtues of the traditional system were
at first staunchly defended, by the time
of the hearings on Rule 191>-3 the existing system had few defenders. Those who
opposed
Rule 19b-3
largely
confined
themselves to either asking for delay, or
suggesting
that the initiation
of competitive cornmtssron
rates should await
a more prosperous period, or be deferred
pending
the taking
of certain
further
steps toward a central market system, or
the adoption of certain proposed safeguards for the auction market process.
A few witnesses
suggested
that some
vaguely outlined better system of fixed
comrmssron
rates should be developed.
No one who testified at the hearings on
Rule 19b-3
supported
any extended
continuation
of the status quo, at least
With respect to public rates.

Exchange Act Rule 9b-1
provides that a national securities
exchange whose tacilrnes are to be used to
effect transactions
In options must first
file with the Commission
a plan which
contains those rules or requirements
of
the exchange that relate solely or significantly to transactions in options on the
exchange. Under that rule, the plan must
be declared effective by the Commission
before any transaction
in options can
take place on that exchange. At the end
of fiscal year 1975, the Commission's
staff was working on a proposal for a
new rule under Section 19 of the Act, as
amended by the 1975 Amendments, which,
If adopted would result In resclssron in
ItS entirety of Rule 9b-1. Amended Section 19 and the new rule would provide

procedures for submission for Oomrrussron approval of proposed exchange rules
generally, and since these would be essentially the same as those of Rule 9b-1,
that rule would be rescinded.

PART 2
THE DISCLOSURE SYSTEM

PART 2
THE DISCLOSURE SYSTEM

A basic purpose of the Federal secunties laws IS to provide disclosure of material, financial and other information on
companies
seeking
to
raise
capital
through the public offering of their secunties, as well as companies whose
securities
are already
publicly
held.
This aims at enabling investors to evaluate the securities of these companies
on an informed and realistic basis.
The Securities Act of 1933 generally
requires that before securities may be
offered to the public a registration statement must be filed with the Commission
disclosmg prescribed categories of information. Before the sale of securities
can begin, the registration statement must
become "effective."
In the sales, investors must be furnished a prospectus
containing the most significant mtormatron
m the registration statement.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
deals m large part with securities already
outstandmg
and
requires
the
registration of securities listed on a national securities exchange, as well as
over-the-counter securities rn which there
is a substantial public Interest. Issuers of
registered
securities
must file annual
and other periodic reports designed to
provide a public file of current material
information. The Exchange Act also requires disclosure of material Information
to holders of registered securities
In
solicitations of proxies for the election of
directors or approval of corporate action
at a stockholders' meeting, or In attempts

to acquire control of a company through
a tender offer or other planned stock
acquisltion. It provides that Insiders of
companies whose equity securities are
registered must report their holdings and
of
transactions in all equity secuntres
their companies.

PUBLIC OFFERING: THE 1933
SECURITIES ACT
The basic concept underlying the Secunties Act's registration
requrrernents
is full disclosure The Commission has no
authority to pass on the merits of the
securities to be offered or on the fairness
of the terms of distribution. If adequate
and accurate disclosure is made, it cannot
deny registration. The Act makes It unlawful to represent to Investors that the
Commission has approved or otherwise
passed on the merits of registered
securities.

Information Provided
While the Securities Act specifies the
information to be Included In registration
statements,
the Commission
has the
authority to prescribe appropriate forms
and to vary the particular Items of information required to be disclosed. To facrlltate the registration of securities by
different types of Issuers, the Commission
has adopted special registration forms
which vary in their disclosure requirements so as to provide maximum dis45

closure of the essential facts pertinent In
a given type of offering while at the same
time minimizing the burden and expense
of compliance with the law. In recent
years, It has adopted certain short forms,
notably Forms &-7 and &-16, which do
not require disclosure of matters already
covered In reports and proxy material
filed or distributed under provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act.
Another short form for registration under the Securities Act IS Form &-8 for
the registration of securities to be offered
to employees of the Issuer and ItS subsidranes. The Commission has proposed
amendments to thrs form designed to reduce the cost and burden of registration
to Issuers consistent with the protection
of Investors by increasing the availability
of the form to more types of employee
plans, particularly certain option plans
which may not receive specral tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.
The relaxed standards may be used by
Issuers pending final action on the proposals.' Comments on the proposals are
presently being reviewed by the staff.

Reviewing Process
Registration statements filed with the
Commiseron are examined by ItS DIVISion
of Corporation
Finance for compliance
with the standards of adequate and accurate disclosure
Various degrees of
review procedures are employed by the
Dlvlslon."
While most deficiencies
are
corrected through an Informal letter of
comment procedure, where the Commission finds that material representations In
a registration statement are misleading,
Inaccurate, or Incomplete, It may, after
for hearing, Issue
notice and opproturuty
a "stop-order," suspending the effectiveness of the statement.

Time for Registration
The Oornrnissron's staff tries to complete examination of registration statements as quickly as possible. The Secuntres Act provides that a registration
statement shall become effective on the
20th day after It is filed (or on the 20th
46

day after the filing of any amendment).
Most registration statements require one
or more amendments and do not become
effective until some time after the statutory 2D-day period. The period between
the filing and effective date IS Intended
to give Investors an opportunity to become
familiar
With the
proposed
offering
through the dissemination
of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission can accelerate the effective date
to shorten the 2D-day waiting perlodtaking Into account, among other things,
the adequacy of the information on the
Issuer already available to the public
and the ease With which facts about the
offering can be understood.
During the 1975 fiscal year, 2,781
registration statements became effective.
Of these, 266 were amendments filed by
Investment companies pursuant to Section 24 (e) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, which provides for the
registration
of
additional
securities
through amendment to an effective registration statement rather than the filing of
a new registration
statement. For the
remaining 2,515 statements, the median
number of calendar days between the
date of the Original filing and the effective
date was 33.

Financial Analysis
and Examination
During the fiscal year, the Office of the
Chief Financial Analyst of the DIVISion
of Corporation Finance reviewed electric
and gas utilities; the bank holding companies Industry; and the fire and casualty
Insurance Industry.
Three new dirnensrons were added durIng the fiscal year to the penodic reviews of specrnc industries. First, the
Input was enlarged by incorporating views
of federal and state agencies and regulatory cornmrssrons, academicians, trade
assocratrons, research analysts and industry speciansts. Secondly, the Office
of the Chief Financial Analyst provided
the DIVISion's examining staff With ratios,
averages and standards for each industry
under review Thirdly, certain statistical
disclosure formats were redesiqned to

reflect the Impact on financial reporting
of dynamic
changes
In the current
economic climate

Office of Oil and Gas
The DIvision's Office of all and Gas
has processing responsibility
for all 011
and gas drilling program filings, as well
as filings covering fractional undivided
interests In oil and gas rights. Seventytwo registration
statements were filed
during fiscal 1975 for oil and gas drilling
programs,
totaling
$638,282,035
And
fifteen registration
statements covering
fractional undivided Interests in 011 and
gas
rights
were
filed
aggregating
$9.098,000.
In addrtron to the direct processing of
those filings, the Office of all and Gas IS
responsible for reviewing the disclosure
relating to 011 and gas busmess and
properties, including data on production
and reserves, contained In other filings
directly processed by the several branches
of the Division. In fiscal 1975, such other
filings consisted of 198 registration statements under the Securities Act and 17
offering circulars pursuant to the Regulation A exemption thereunder, as well as
registration statements and proxy statements under the Exchange Act.
Additional information regarding offerIngs of fractional undivided interests IS
contained
under Regulation B In this
Part.

Tax Shelters
DUring the year, a significant number of
registration
statements relating to real
estate limited partnerships and other tax
shelter offerings were filed With the Commtssron, All registration statements relatIng to real estate limited partnerships
were processed by one branch within the
Division of Corporation
Finance, while
registration statements relating to other
non-oil and gas types of tax shelters,
such as cattle feeding and breeding,
agri-business
and leasmq, as well as
condominium offerings, were processed
In a separate branch. A third branch, the
Office of all and Gas, has processing

responsibility for tax shelters relating to
and gas.
In all of these types of offerings, the
disclosure generally emphastzed has included the compensation
paid to the
program sponsors, the conflicts of Interest
Inherent in many such offerings,
the
record In prior offerings of the sponsors
of the offering, and the tax ramifications
of the offering.
011

Dividend Reinvestment Plans
In recent years, an increasing number
of Issuers provide a means by which
security holders might automatically
reInvest drvidends In additional secunties
of the issuer. In response to this Increased
Interest In divrdend reinvestment plans,
the Oomrnlssron
In August 1974, announced a revised interpretative posmon
of Corporation
Finance
of ItS Drvisron
offered and sold
concerning secuntres
Without registration under the Securities
Act pursuant to drvidend reinvestment
and similar plans 3 The release states that
until further notice, the DIVISion Will take
the position that the issuer or ItS affiliates
may perform bookkeeping
and Similar
administrative functions In operating such
plans and that these activities, in and of
themselves, will not cause the participation of the issuer or its affiliates to exceed the limitations set forth In Securities
Act Release No. 4790. The revised interpretation requires that the agent not
be affiliated With the Issuer, and that
secunties acquired on behalf of the plan
be acquired through such agent.

SMALL ISSUE EXEMPTION
The Commission is authorized under
Section 3(b) of the Securities Act to
exempt secunties from registration If It
finds that registration for these securrtres
IS not necessary to the publrc mterest
because of the small offering amount or
limited character of the public offering.
The law Imposes a maximum limitation
of $500,000 upon the size of the Issues
which
may
be
exempted
by
the
Commission.
The Commissron has adopted the fol47

lowing exemptive rules and requlatrcns:
Regulation
A: General exemption
for U.S. and Canadian Issues up to
$500,000.
Regulation B: Exemption for fractional undivided Interests In 011 or
gas rights up to $250,000.
E. Exemption
for seRegulation
cunties of a small business investment company up to $500,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for
assessable stock offered or sold to
realize the amount of assessment
up to $300,000.
Rules 234-237; 240: Exemptions of
first lien notes, secuntres of cooperative
housmq
corporations,
shares offered In connection with
certain transactions, certain securities owned for five years and certain limited offers and sales of
small dollar amounts of securities
by closely-held Issuers.

Ing IS In progress and upon ItS termination. Sales reported dunnq 1974 had
totaled $69 million. Various features of
Regulation A offerings over the past three
years are presented In the statistical
section of this report.
In fiscal 1975, the Commission temporarily suspended 9 exemptions where
It had reason to believe there had been
noncompliance with the conditions of the
regulation or with disclosure standards,
or where the exemption was not available
for the securities. Added to 17 cases
pending at the beginning of the fiscal
year, trus resulted In a total of 26 cases
Of these, the temporary
for drspositron
suspension order became permanent In
18 cases: In 7 by lapse of time, In 2 cases
after hearings, and In 8 by acceptance of
an offer of settlement. One temporary
suspension
order was vacated
Eight
cases were pending at the end of the
fiscal year.

Regulation B
Regulation A
Regulation A permits a company to
obtain needed capital not In excess of
$500,000 (including
underwriting
commissions) In anyone year from a public
offering of ItS secuntres without registration, provided specified condrtrons
are
met. Among other things, a notrfrcanon
and offering circular supplying basic information about the company and the
secuntres
offered must be filed with the
Commission, and the offering Circular

thereto,
covering aggregate sales of $199 million.
In fiscal 1975, the Commission temporarily
suspended
the Regulation
B
exemption for one offeror where It had
evidence that the offeror had failed to
comply with certain requirements. At year
end, the suspension had not yet become
permanent. In the prior fiscal year, there
was one temporary suspension of the

Regulation B exemption
permanent when the offeror Withdrew ItS
request for a heanng.

Regulation E
Under Section 3(c) of the Securities
Act, the Commission
IS authonzed to
adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities Issued by a small business investment company under the Small Bustness Investment Act. Pursuant to that
section, the Commission
has adopted
Regulation E, which conditionally exempts
such securities
Issued by companies
registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 up to a maximum offering
price of $500,000. The regulation is substantially similar to Regulation A, descnbed above. No notifications were filed
under Regulation E for the two preceding
fiscal years.

Regulation F
Regulation F provides exemptions from
registration for two types of transactions
concerning
assessable stock. First, an
assessment levied upon an existinq secunty holder may be exempted under the
regulation, provided the assessable stock
IS Issued by a corporation incorporated
under the laws of and having ItS principal
business operations in any State, Terntory or the District of Columbia. Regulation F provides an exemption also when
assessable stock of any such corporation
IS sold publicly to realize the amount of
an assessment levied thereon, or when
such stock is publicly reoffered by an
underwriter or dealer. The exemption is
available
for amounts
not exceeding

$300,000 per year The Regulation requires the filing of a notification
and
other rnatenals describing the offering.
During the 1975 fiscal year, 15 notifications were filed under Regulation F,
covering
assessments
of
stock
of
$380,318, compared With 12 notifications
covering assessments of $408,652 In 1974.

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE: THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
contains significant disclosure provislons
designed to provide a fund of current
material Information
on companies
in
whose securities there IS a substantial
public Interest. The Act also seeks to assure that secunty holders who are solicited to exercise their voting nghts, or
In response to a
to sell their securrtres
tender
offer,
are furnished
pertinent
information.

Registration on Exchanges
Generally speaking, a security cannot
be traded on a national secunties exchange until It is registered under Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act. If it meets the
listing
requirements
of the particular
exchange, an Issuer may register a class
of secunties on the exchange by filing
With the Commission and the exchange
an application which discloses pertinent
information concerning
the Issuer and
ItS affairs. During fiscal year 1975, a
total of 114 Issuers listed and registered
securities on a national securities exchange for the first time and a total of
were filed
575 registration applicatrons
The registrations of all securities of 192
Issuers were terminated. Detailed stattstrcs
regarding
secunties
traded
on
exchanges may be found In the statistical
section of this report.

Over-the-Counter

Registration

Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act requires a company With total assets exceeding $1 million and a class of equity
secunties held of record by 500 or more
with
persons to register those secuntres
49

the Commission, unless one of the exemptions set forth In that section IS available, or the Oornmrsston Issues an exemptive order under Section 12(h) Upon
reqrstratron,
the reporting
and other
disclosure requirements and the insider
trading provrsrons
of the Act apply to
these companies to the same extent as
to those with securities
registered on
exchanges
DUring the fiscal year, 372 registration
statements were filed under Section 12(g)
Of these, 144 were filed by Issuers already subject to the reporting requirements, either because they had another
security registered on an exchange or
they had registered securities under the
Securities Act Included are companies
which succeeded to the businesses of
reporting companies, and thereby became
subject to the reporting requirements

Exemptions
Section 12(h) of the Act authorizes the
Commission to grant a complete or partial
exernptron from the registratIOn provrsions
of Section 12(g) or from other disclosure
and msider trading provrsions
of the Act
where It IS not contrary to the public
Interest or the protection of Investors
At the beginning of the year, 10 exemption applrcattons
were pending, and
44 apphcatrons
were filed dUring the
year. Of these 54 applications,
15 were
Withdrawn, 18 were granted, and 4 denied.
The remaining
17 applications
were
pending at the end of the fiscal year

Periodic Reports
Section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act requires Issuers of secuntres
registered pursuant to Sections 12(b) and 12(g)
to file penodic reports, keeping current
the information contained In the registratron applrcanon or statement
Similar
reports are required pursuant to Section
15(d) of certain Issuers which have filed
reqrstratron
statements
under the Secunties Act which have become effective.
In 1975, 54,640 reports-annual,
quarterly and current-were
flied.
In December 1974, the Oornrrusston

50

rescinded the requirement that registrants
furnish an EDP attachment as an exhibit 4
The EDP attachment, which was required
In certain reports on Forms 1Q-K and
10-0, had been used by the Commission
to gather Information generally reflected
In the report to which It was an exhibit

the funcThe Commrsston
tional justification for the attachment did
not warrant ItS continued use and accordIngly rescrnded any requirement that it

Proxy Solicitations
Where proxies are solicited from holders of securities registered under Section
12 or from security holders of registered
public-utility
holding
companies,
subsidiaries of holding companies, or registered Investment companies, the Commission's proxy regulation requires that
disclosure be made of all material facts
concerning the matters on which the security holders were asked to vote, and
that they be afforded an opportunity to
vote "yes" or "no" on any matter other
than the election
of directors
Where
management IS soucmno proxies, a secunty holder desrrmq
to communicate
With the other security holders may require management to furnish him With a
list of all security holders or to mall his
communication for him A security holder
may also, subject to certain limitations,
require the management to Include In
proxy material an appropriate
proposal
which he wants to submit to a vote of
security holders, or he may make an
Independent proxy sohcrtatron.
Copies of proposed
proxy material
must be filed with the Commission in
preliminary form prior to the date of the
proposed solicitation. Where preliminary
material fails to meet the prsscnbed drsclosure standards, the management or
other group responsrbte
for ItS preparanon IS notified informally and given an
opportunity to correct the deficiencies in
the preparation
of the definitive
proxy
material
to be furnished
to security
holders.
Issuers of secunties registered under
Section 12 must transmit an Information

statement comparable to proxy material
to security holders from whom proxies
are not solicited
with
respect
to a
stockholders' meeting.
DUring the 1975 fiscal
year, 6,826
proxy statements In definitive form were
filed, 6,801 by management and 25 by
non management
groups
or individual
stockholders. In addition, 127 information
statements were filed. The proxy and information
statements
related to 6,762
companies, and pertained to 6,685 meetIngs for the election of directors,
216
special meetings not involving the elecnon of directors,
and 27 assents and
authorizations.
Aside from the election of directors,
the votes of security holders were solicrted with respect to a variety of matters,
Including
merger,
consolidations,
acqutsrtions. sales of assets and dissolution
of companies (191); authorizations of new
or additional securities, modifications of
exrsnnq secuntres, and recaprtalrzatton
plans (474); employee pension and retirement
plans (65); bonus or profrtsharing plans and deferred compensation
arrangements (217), stock option plans
(705); approval of selection by management of Independent auditors (3,366) and
miscellaneous
amendments to charters
and by-laws, and other matters (1,868)
DUring the 1975 fiscal year, 370 proposals submitted by 68 stockholders for
action at stockholders'
meetings were
Included In the proxy statements of 198
companies.
Typical of such proposals
submitted to a vote of security holders
were resolutions on amendments to charters or by-laws to provide for cumulative
voting for the election of directors, preemptive rights, limitations on the grant of
stock options to and their exercise by key
employees and management groups, the
sending of a post meeting report to all
stockholders, and Irrnttatrons on charitable
contributions.
A total of 185 proposals submitted by
87 stockholders
were omitted from the
proxy statements
of 90 companies
In
accordance
with the provisrons of the
rule governing such proposals. The most
common grounds for omission were that
proposals were not submitted on time

or were not proper SUbjects for stockholders' action under the applicable state
law
In fiscal 1975, 25 companies were involved In proxy contests for the election
of directors which bring special requirements Into play. In these contests, 303
persons,
lncludrnq
both
management
and non management, filed detailed statements required of partrcipants under the
applicable rule. Control of the board of
directors was Involved In 20 Instances. In
10 of these, management retained control. Of the remainder, three were settled
by negotiation,
one was won by nonmanagement persons, and six were pendIng at year end. In the other five cases,
representation on the board of directors
was Involved. Management retained all
places on the board In three contests,
opposttion candidates won places on the
board In two cases.

Takeover Bids, Large
Acquisitions
Sections 13(d) and (e), and 14(d), (e)
and (f) of the Securities Exchange Act,
enacted In 1968 and amended In 1970,
provide for full disclosure In cash tender
offers and other stock acqu ismons involvmq changes In ownerstup or control
These provrsions
were desiqned
to close gaps In the full disclosure provisrons of the secuntres
laws and to
safeguard the interest of persons who
tender their secunties In response to a
tender offer.
During the 1975 fiscal
year, 1,165
Schedule 13D reports were filed by persons or groups which had made acqursinons resulting In their ownership of more
than five percent of a class of securities.
One hundred thirteen Schedule 13D reports were filed by persons or groups
making tender offers (including 24 tender
offers filed With the Commission by foreign nationals),
which.
If successful,
would result In more than five percent
ownership. In addition, 73 Schedule 14D
or
reports were filed on solrcttatrons
recomrnendatrons In a tender offer by a
person other than the maker of the offer
Twelve statements were filed for the re51

placement of a majority of the board of
directors otherwise than by stockholder
vote. SIX statements were filed under a
rule on corporate reacqursmons of secunnes while an Issuer IS the target of a
cash tender offer.
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act
exempts certain communications Involved
In a tender offer from the provisrons of
Regulation 140. Among such communications are those from an Issuer to ItS security holders which do no more than
Identify the tender offer, state that management IS studying the proposal and
request the security holders to defer rnakIng a decrsron on the tender offer until
they receive management's recommendation
Such recommendations
must be
made no later than 10 days before expiration of the tender offer, unless the Comrmssron authorizes a shorter period.
DUring the fiscal year, the Commission
delegated to the Director of the Division
of Corporation Finance authority to permit
management
recommendations
to be
made within less than the ten-day period
of Rule 14d-2(f).5 rms procedure was
adopted to expedite the Commission's
handling such requests because they
usually need prompt action

Insider Reporting
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act and corresponding provrsrons In the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and the Investment Company Act of
1940 are designed to provide other stockholders
and Investors generally
with
information on Insider securities transactions and holdings, and to prevent unfair use of confidential
information by
insiders to profit from short-term trading
In a company's securities.
secnon 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires every person who beneficially
owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10
percent of any class of equity security
which IS registered under Section 12, or
who IS a director or an officer of the ISsuer of any such security, to file statements with the Commission disclosing
the amount of all equity securities of the
Issuer of which he IS the beneficial owner
52

and changes In such ownership. Copies
of such statements must be filed with exchanges on which the securities
are
listed
Similar provisions applicable
to
insiders of registered public-utility
holdIng companies and registered closed-end
Investment companies are contained In
the Holding Company and Investment
Company Acts.
In fiscal 1975, 91,298 ownership reports were filed. These Included 11,953
initial statements of ownership on Form
3, 74,303 statements of changes in ownership on Form 4, and 5,042 amendments
to previously filed reports.
All ownership reports are made available for public inspection when filed at
the Commission's office In Washington
and at the exchanges where copies are
filed
In addition, the information contained In reports filed with the Commission
IS summarized
and published
in the
monthly "Official
Summary of Security
Transactions
and Holdings,"
which is
distributed
by the Government Printing
Office to about 11,500 subscribers.

ACCOUNTING
The securities acts reflect a recoqrunon by Congress that dependable financial
statements
of a company
are
indispensable
to informed
Investment
decrsrons regarding its securities. A major objective of the Commission has been
to Improve accounting,
reporting
and
auditing standards applicable to the financial statements and to assure that
high standards of professional conduct
are maintained by the public accountants
who examine the statements. The primary
responsibility for thrs program rests with
the Chief Accountant of the Commission
Under the Commission's
broad rulemaking power, it has adopted a basic
accounting regulation (Regulation S-X)
which, together with interpretations and
gUidelines on accounting and reporting
procedures
published
as "Accounting
Series Releases," governs the form and
content of financial statements filed In
compliance
with the securities
laws.
The Oommrssron has also formulated
rules on accounting for and auditing of

broker-dealers
and prescribed
uniform
systems of accounts for mutual and subsidiary
service
companies
related
to
holding companies subject to the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
The accounting rules and opinions of the
in parCommission,
and its decrsions
ticular cases, have contributed to clarification
and wider acceptance
of the
accounting principles and practices and
auditing
standards
developed
by the
protessron
and generally followed In the
preparation of financial statements.
However, the accounting and fmancral
reporting rules and regulatlons--except
for the uniform systems of accounts which
are regulatory reports-prescribe
accountIng principles to be followed only in certain limited areas. In the large area of
tmancial reporting not covered by ItS
rules, the Commission's principal means
of protecting investors from inadequate
or Improper
financial
reporting
IS by
requiring
a report of an Independent
publro
accountant,
based on an audit
performed in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, which expresses an opinion whether the financial
statements are presented fairly In conformity With accounting
pnnciples
and
practices that are recognized as sound
and have attained general acceptance.
The requirement
that the opinion
be
rendered by an independent accountant,
which was initially established under the
Securities Act of 1933, is desrqned to
secure for the benefit of public Investors
the detached objectrvity and the skill of
a knowledgeable professional person not
connected With management.
The accounting
staff reviews the nnancral statements filed with the Commission
to insure
that the required
standards
are observed
and that the
accounting and auditing procedures do
not remain static in the face of changes
and new developments in financial and
economic conditions.
New methods of
doing busmess, new types of busmess,
the combining of old bustnesses, the use
of more sophisticated
securities,
and
other innovations create accounting problems which require a constant reappraisal
of the procedures

Relations With the Accounting
Profession
In order to keep abreast of changing
conditions, and In recognition of the need
for a continuous exchange of views and
Information
between the Commission's
accounting staff and outside accountants
regarding
appropriate
accounting
and
auditing polrcras. procedures and practices, the staff maintains continuing contact With individual accountants and various protesstonal organizations. The latter
include the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AI CPA) and the FInanciat
Accounting
Standards
Board
(FASS), the pnncrpal
professional
organizations concerned With the development and Improvement of accounting and
audrtlnq
standards
and practices.
The
Chief Accountant
also meets regularly
With his counterparts In other regulatory
agencies
to Improve coordination
on
pollcres and actions among the agencies.
Because of ItS many foreign registrants
and the vast and Increasing foreign operations of American companies, the Commission has an Interest In the Improvement of accounting
and auditing principles and procedures on an lnternatronal
basis To promote such Improvement, the
Chief Accountant corresponds with foreign accountants,
lntervisws many who
vlsrt
this country
and, on occasion,
particrpates
In foreign and International
accounting conferences.
Protessronal efforts are being made to
Improve and harmonize accounting standards among countries through vanous
international accounting conferences and
committees. One committee, comprised of
representatives
of accountancy
groups
from twenty-seven countries, was established to promulgate
international
accounting standards. This committee has
adopted one standard, has proposed a
number of other standards and IS developIng additional proposals. The Oommrssron
will cooperate closely with these committees and groups which have as their
long-term objective the development of
a coordinated
worldwide
accounting
protessron with Uniform standards.

Accounting and Auditing
Standards
The FASB supplanted the Accounting
Principles
Board of the AICPA, which
ceased operations on June 30, 1973, as
the orqaruzatron which establishes standards of financial accounting and presentation for the gUidance of Issuers and
public accountants. The new orqaruzatron
was established on the basis of recomappointed
mendations
by a cornrmttee
by the AICPA rn early 1971 to explore
ways of rrnprovrnq this function. A financial accountrng foundation, sponsored by
the AICPA and consrstrnq of representatives of leadrng professional
organizations, appornts the seven members of the
FASB who serve on a salaned, full-time
basts, and the members of an advisory
council to the Board who serve on a
voluntary
basts
The Commission
endorsed h the FASB, which It believes will
provide operational
efficiencies
and Insure an Impartial viewpornt m the development of accounting
standards
on a
timely basts, and stated that the FASB's
would be
statements and rnterpretanons
considered as berng substantial authorrtatrve support for an accountrng practice
or procedure
As of June 30, 1975, the FASB had ISsued
seven
Statements
of Financial
Accounting Standards and SIX Interpretations relatrng to accounting oprrnons or
standards. In addition, It had under active
consideration
a heavy agenda of technical projects
which Included.
nnancral
reportrng for segments of a business
enterprise, accountrng for leases; cntena
for determrnrng
rnatenalrty,
conceptual
framework for accountrng and reportrng;
accountrng for translation of foreign currency transactions
and foreign currency
tmanciat statements; nnancral reportrng
in units of general purchasrng
power;
business combinations
and purchased
intangibles, accountrng for mterest costs;
accounting
and reportrng for employee
benefrt plans; accounting for the cost of
pension plans, and accountrng for rncome
taxes-s-ou and gas producing companres.
It had held public hearings on five of the

54

projects and had issued exposure drafts
of three proposed statements of standards.
The FASB recently appointed a permanent screening committee to assist It In
identifying
emerging practice problems,
evaluating their magnitude and urgency,
and assessrng pnontres for their resolution. The Chief Accountant and the FASB
maintain liaison procedures for consultation on projects of either the Board or the
SEC which are of mutual rnterest. When
the FASB Issues improved standards of
accountrng and financial
reporting, the
Commission updates its rules and regulations to conform to the Improved standards, rn accordance
with ItS stated
policy
Such amendments
have been
proposed 7 to effect conformity with the
standards established in FASB Statement
Nos. 2 and 7, "Accountrng for Research
and Development Costs" and "Accountrng and Reporting by Development Stage
Enterprrses."
The AICPA appointed another committee rn early 1971 to study and refine the
objectives
of financial
statements.
It
studied the baSIC questions of who needs
tmancral
statements,
what information
should be provided,
how It should be
communicated,
and how much of It can
be provided
through
the accounting
process. The committee's
report on the
objectives of financial statements, which
was published rn October 1973, IS berng
utilized by the FASB as the baSIS of ItS
study of the conceptual
framework for
accountrng and reporting
More recently the AICPA established a
Commission on Auditors' ResponsibilitIes
charred by former SEC Charrman Manuel
Cohen which will determine whether a
gap exists between what the public expects of auditors and what auditors can
reasonably be expected to accomplish.
Specific questions to which this Commission
seeks
answers
mclude:
Should
auditors monitor all financial mtorrnatron
released to the public and, If so, what
should be the extent of their responsibilities? Should the auditor's standard report, particularly
the phrase "present
fairly," be changed to express better the

responsibilities
of
auditors?
Is
the
rnacharusrn for developing auditing standards adequate?
The Chief Accountant
also maintains
liaison with other senior committees of
the AICPA on projects of mutual Interest,
principally,
proposed audit guides and
standards
of the Auditing
Standards
Executive Committee and the proposed
statements of position of the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee. Regular
meetings are held with the Committee on
SEC Regulations to provide information
and gUidance to the protessron concerning the Interpretation of and compliance
with the Commission's
accounting
and
auditing requirements applicable to registrants and their Independent accountants.

Other Developments
The Commission has developed a new
publication series entitled "Staff AccountIng Bulletins"
to provide information to
the public regarding informal and adrnmrstratrve practices and gUidelines developed by the accounting staff with respect
to specific
accounting
and auditing
problems considered
In the review of
tmancral data flled.s
During the fiscal year, the Commission
issued 16 Accounting Series Releases to
provide interpretations
or guidelines on
matters
of accounting
principles
and
auditing standards, to require Improved
disclosure
of financial
information
by
amendment of reporting forms or Regulation S-X, or to announce decisrons In
disciplinary proceedings under Rule 2(e)
of the Commission's
Rules of Practice
concerning accountants appearing before
It.
Four interpretative or advisory releases
requirements
for financial
dealt
with
statements
of limited
partnerships
In
annual reports filed with the Commisslon,9 disclosure
of unusual risks and
reportmq.!v
uncertainties
In financial
financial disclosure problems relating to
the adoption
of the LIFO Inventory
metnod,n and amendments of guidelines
pertaining to classification
of short-term
obligations expected to be refinanced.I'

Three releases were Issued In which
amendments
to Regulation
S-X were
adopted to effect improved disclosures In
specific
areas of financial
statements.
one release 13 dealt With the capitalization of Interest by non-utility companies,
including Imposition of a moratorium on
capitalization
by such companies which
had not previously followed that policy:
another release 14 dealt With the components
of accounts
receivable
and
inventories relating to defense and other
long-term contract activities, and a third
release 15 With the relationships between
registrants
and their Independent
accountants
Thrs latter release also contained amendments to a report form and
rules under the Exchange Act regarding
those relationshtps.
In conjunction
With the DIVISion of
Corporation
Finance, a release was ISsued adopting
gUides for the textual
analysis of the summary of earnings or
operations In the preparation of registration statements and reports under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In
conjunction With the Drvlsion of Corporate
Regulation, a release 17 was Issued reSCinding the uniform system of accounts
for registered holding companies under
the Holding Company Act, In order to
tacurtate adjustment of their accounts to
generally accepted accounting standards.
In lieu of the uniform system of accounts,
the requirements of Regulation S-X for
the form and content of tmancral statements were made applicable.
Shortly after the end of the fiscal year,
an amendment to Article 4 of Regulation
S-X was adopted 18 relating to the requrrernents for consolidated
and combined tmancrat statements In filings with
the Commisston Also after the end of the
fiscal year, amendments to Regulation
S-X and filing forms were adopted 19
which require
Increased disclosure
of
interim tmancral data. Condensed frnancial statements and a narrative analysis
of the results of operations are to be
included In quarterly reports filed and
summary data regarding
the quarterly
results In a fiscal year are to be Included
in a note to the tmancial statements filed

55

for a fiscal year. These requirements
were adopted after public constderatron
of proposals 20 and subsequent alternative proposals 21 and public hearings regarding increased disclosure of Interim
results by registrants and review of such
data by independent accountants. In connection with the adoption of these requirements, the Commission Issued 23 for
public comment revised proposed standards and procedures to be applicable to
the review of the interim financial data by
the Independent
accountants
In the
absence
of adequate
standards
and
procedures promulgated by the accountIng profession.
Dunng the fiscal year, other proposals
were Issued for public comment, one 24
of which would effect a general revision
of Article 7 of Regulation S-X, pertaining
to the form and content of financial statements of title Insurance and mortgage
guarantee Insurance companies, to reflect
developments In accounting practice, including the requirements that the financial statements be prepared In accordance with generally accepted accounting
pnnciples.
Another
proposal 25 would
effect minor amendments In vanous sections of Regulation S-X regarding disclosures of leases, compensating balances
and short-term borrowing arrangements,
and Income tax expense.
The Commission
Issued opinions In
seven proceedings under Rule 2(e) of its
Rules of Practice during the fiscal year.
Under that rule, the Commission may
disqualify an attorney or accountant from
practicing
before It, either temporarily
or permanently, or It may censure him on
grounds specified In the rule. In one proceeding 26 an accounting firm was censured for failing fully to disclose to the
Commission
and the public the facts
relating to a settlement negotiated between the firm and a client regarding an
audit of certain Inventories that were misstated In the tmancral statements of the
client filed with the Comrmssron.
In three proceedings 27, accountants
were permanently suspended from appeanng or practicing before the Comrrussron. In each case the accountant had
been permanently enjoined by a Federal
56

court In a Cornmissron
injunctive action
from violating antifraud provlsrons of the
Federal securities laws. In one instance
the accountant was given the nght to
apply for reinstatement after September

20,1976.
In another proceedlng,28 an accountIng firm, which had been permanently
enjoined by a Federal court from Violating
antifraud provrsrons of the Federal securities laws, was censured and remedial
sanctions were imposed. The firm was
required to employ a consultant for one
year, who will be available for special
consulting requests, will review approximately 15 percent of the firm's audits
dunng the year of publicly held companies, report to the Oommrssron regarding
the adequacy of the audit work performed
In such audits, and require the firm to
adopt auditing procedures to determine
whether its clients
have entered Into
matenal transactions With related parties.
In the event the firm should merge with
another firm at least twice as large the
above requirements would terminate and
the combined firm would be required to
apply its quality control standards to the
audits of the financial statements of the
publicly held former clients of the original
firm and to render progress reports on
such application to the CommiSSion.
In a proceeding 29 pertaining to an accounting firm which had failed to comply
With generally accepted auditing standards and the Oommrssron's
Instructions
In Form X-17A-5 In the audit of a brokerdealer's tmanciat statement, the firm and
a partner of the firm were suspended
from appeanng or practicing before the
Oornmrssron
for 18 months. They were
required to request a review of their
auditlnq
procedures
under the quality
review program of the Amencan Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and to
correct any deficiencies
reported. The
firm was also required to give notice In
wntlng of these findings to any client who
requests auditing services for the purpose
of registratIOn With or reporting to the
Cornrmssron.
In another proceeding sanctions were
Imposed 30 against an accounting
firm
and a partner of the firm on the basis of a

consent injunction involving violations of
of the Exchange
the antifraud provisrons
Act. The firm was required to request the
AICPA to designate persons satisfactory
to the Commission's Chief Accountant to
review audit work papers, personnel and
other records of the firm to determine
whether audit and professional
procedures are adequate. The firm was prohibited from accepting engagements for a
period of 10 months with new clients
involving auditing or accounting services
In connection with filing of financial statements with, or submissions or certifications to, the Commission. In addition, the
firm was ordered to require, for a nveyear period, each of its partners to attend
courses or seminars In subjects relating
to public accounting or auditing to the
extent of at least 40 hours per year. The
enjoined
partner was prohibited
from
practicing' before the Commission for a
period of 10 months as an accountant
other than as an employee or consultant
under supervision, and in no case to act
as or be a partner of the accounting firm.
He was also required to complete a program of continuing professional education by attending at least 100 hours of
acceptable courses or seminars in public
accounting and auditing subjects within
a period of 10 months.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal
year, three opinions were Issued In proceedings
Instituted against accounting
firms pursuant to Rule 2(e). One proceeding involved a major accounting firm,
against which the Commission had filed
four crvn injunctive complaints concerning the firm's examinations of financial
statements of four companies and questions raised in an investigation regarding
the firm's audit of the financial statements
of another company."! The firm was required to have an investigation made of
its audit practices with respect to the
financial statements of client-registrants
of the Commission and to promptly adopt
and Implement any recommended corrective actions. The firm was also required
to conduct a study of the percentage of

and
establish guidelines to be applied In the
conduct of future audits. For a period of

six months, the firm was not permitted to
accept engagements from new clients
(with certain
exceptions)
to examine
financial statements to be filed with the
Commission. In addition the firm is required to have reviews conducted in 1976
and 1977 In conformity with the AICPA's
program for the review of quality control
procedures of multi-office firms to determine whether the firm has adopted and

The other proceedings were instituted
on the baSIS of investigations
In which
the Commission found that accounting
firms did not perform the audits of financial statements of registrants filed with
the Commission In accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. In one
firm was

censured
by the Commission.
In the
second proceeding 33 the accounting firm
was ordered to employ consultants
to
review and evaluate ItS auditing procedures and professional practice in connection with the audits of publicly held
companies with a report of conclusions to
be made to the Commission, and the firm
was ordered not to accept engagements

TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
Ttus Act requires that bonds, debentures, notes and similar debt securities
offered for public sale, except as specifically exempted, be Issued under an indenture which meets the requirements of
the Act and has been duly qualified With
the Commission.
The provrsrons of the Act are closely
Integrated with the requirements of the
Securities Act. Registration pursuant to
the Securities Act of securities to be

issued under a trust Indenture SUbject to
the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted
to become effective unless the Indenture
conforms to the requirements of the latter
Act designed to safeguard the rights and
Interests of the purchasers. Moreover,
specified information about the trustee
and the indenture must be Included In
the registration-statement.
The Act was passed after studies by
the Commission had revealed the frequency With which trust Indentures failed
to provide minimum protections for secunty holders and absolved so-called trustees from minimum obligations
In the
discharge of the trusts It requires, among
other things, that the Indenture trustee be
a corporation With a minimum combined
capital and surplus and be free of conflicting
interests which might Interfere
With the faithful exercise of its duties on
behalf of the purchasers of the secuntres,
and It imposes high standards of conduct
and responsibility on the trustee. During
nscat year 1975, 528 trust Indentures
relating to securities
In the aggregate
amount of $34.9 billion were filed.

INFORMATION FOR PUBLIC
INSPECTION; FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION ACT
On November
21, 1974, Congress
passed over President Ford's veto amendments to the Freedom of lntormatron
Act 34 which Significantly
changed the
procedures governing the handling of
requests made pursuant to the Freedom
of lntorrnatron Act (5 U.S.C. 552) as well
as the scope of certain of the exemplions
from the Act's provisions These amendments became effective
February 19,
1975. The Oornmrssron amended ItS rules
under the Freedom of Information Act
(17 CFR 200.80) 35 to reflect the amended
provisions of the Freedom of Intorrnatron
Act; these rules specify the categones of
available matenals and those categones
of records that are generally considered
These rules establish

procedure to be followed In requesting
records or copies and provides for a
method of adrninlstranve appeal from the
denial of access to any record. They also
59

provide for the Imposition of duplicating
fees and search fees when more than
one-half man-hour of work IS performed
by the Commission's staff to locate and
make records available. In addition to the
records
described,
the
Commission
makes available for inspection and copyIng all requests for no-action and interpretative letters received after December
31, 1970, and responses thereto (17 CFR
200.81). Also made available since November 1, 1972 are materials filed under
Proxy Rule 14a-8(d), which deals with
proposals offered by shareholders
for
inclusion In management proxy-soliciting
materials, and related materials prepared
by the staff (17 CFR 200.82).
Followrnq
the effective
date of the
amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, the Commission instituted the
practice of rssurnq a publrc release, In a
Freedom of Informaseries desrqnated
tion Act Releases, In most administrative
appeals decrded
under the Act
The
Commission
hopes that this series of
releases Will serve to Inform the pubhc
as to ItS disclosure polrcres
under the
Freedom of Information Act and of the
manner In which It has Interpreted and
applied the Act to the many types of
records maintained by the Commission.
Most of the administrative
appeals
decided by the Comrnissron from the
effective date of the amendments to the
close of the fiscal year were concerned
With investigatory records. The seventh
exemption of the Act, as amended, provices that the Freedom of Information
Act "does not apply" to such records to
the extent that their production would
"Interfere
With enforcement
proceedings," "deprive a person of a right to a
fair trial or an Impartial adjudrcanon,"
"constitute
an unwarranted rnvasron of
personal privacy," or cause other types
of harm specifically
enumerated an the
exemption.
The Cornrnlssron,
In the
administrative
appeals It has decided,
has determined that investigatory records
Will generally be Withheld on the ground
that production Will "mtertere With enforcement proceedings" only If judrcral or

files closed after the completion of public
law enforcement proceedings Will generally be available to any person requestIng access to them.37 In those cases
where investigations
are closed by the
Cornmisston without
the institution
of
public enforcement action, the Commission has recognized that consrderatrons
of personal privacy often require that
such records not be disclosed to members of the publlc,38 except where a

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT LITIGATION
In Wolfson v. S.E.C.,40 plaintiff
requested access to the contents of two
investigatory files compiled In the early
1950's. Following the enactment of the
amendment to the Freedom of Information
Act relating to the exemption for investigatory records, the Commission reconsidered its earlier denial of access to the
requested records, and granted plaintiff's
request with respect to all investigatory
records in Its pcssessron, with the exception of inter- and Intra-agency memoranda contained in the file, which In the
Commission's view were exempt by virtue
of the fifth exemption of the Freedom of
Information
Act. The court thereupon
allowed plaintiff
a period of time to
amend his complaint, and upon his failure
to do so, the action was dismissed.
In Ptrst Mid America v. S.E.C.,41 the
Commission was named In a SUIt seeking
an Injunction to prohibit the disclosure of
certain Investigatory records It had previously determined to produce to a third
party who had requested access pursuant
to the Freedom of Information Act. In ItS
complaint,
plaintiff
claimed
that the
records the Commission
proposed to
disclose were protected by the attorneyclient privilege and that disclosure would
be an unwarranted Invasion of personal
privacy. After stipulating that It would not
disclose the records pending resolution
61

by the court of the Issues raised by the
complaint,
the Commission filed an Answer and Counterclaim
for Interpleader
seeking to bring Into the SUIt as the real
party In Interest the person seeking the
records under the Freedom of Information
Act. Before the Commission's
motion to
add the requester as a party had been
acted upon, however, plaintiff
withdrew

dismissal of the action

REGULATION OF
SECURITIES MARKETS

In addition to the disclosure provisions
discussed in the preceding chapter, the
Securities Exchange Act assigns to the
Commission broad regulatory responsibilities for securities markets and persons
in the securities business. That Act,
among other things, requires securities
exchanges to register with the Commission, provides for Commission suparvision of the self-regulatory responsibilities
of registered exchanges, and permits
registration of associations of brokers or
dealers exercising self-regulatory functions under Commission supervision.
The Act requires registration and regulation of brokers and dealers doing a
business in securities. it also contains
provisions designed to prevent fraudulent,
deceptive and manipulative acts and
practices on the exchanges and in the
over-the-counter markets.
The Securities Acts Amendments of
1975 (the "1975 Amendments") 1 establish a new self-regulatory organization,
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board, to formulate rules for the municipai securities industry subject to the
oversight of the Commission. The amendments also authorize a national system
for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and require municipal
securities dealers, certain securities information processors, clearing agencies
and transfer agents to register, keep
records, and file reports with the Commission. These recent developments concerning regulation of the securities
markets are discussed in Part I.

REGULATION OF EXCHANGES
Registration
The Securities Exchange Act generally
requires a securities exchange to register
with the Commission as a national securities exchange unless the Commission
exempts it from registration, because of
the limited volume of its transactions.2

On January 31. 1975 the National Stock
Exchange ceased operations and has
since been proceeding with the necessary
steps under New York State law for corporate dis~oiution.That exchange is also
in the process of seeking delisting of its
listed securities and will then withdraw its
registration as a national securities exchange.
In March 1975 the Executive Committee
of the Board of Trade of the City of

Chicago adopted a resolution to close
the Board's secunties market The Commission's staff has been Informed that
the Board IS now prepared to file a written notice of withdrawal from registration.

Delisting
Pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, securmes may be strrcken
from listing and registration upon application to the Commission by an exchange,
or withdrawn from listing and registration
upon application by an Issuer, in accordance with the rules of the exchange
and upon such terms as the Commission
may Impose for the protection of investors It IS the Commission's view that In
evaluating dellstlng applications, It IS not
generally the Commission's
function to
substitute ItS Judgment for that of an exchange, and that where there has been
full compliance with the rules of an exchange with respect to delisting,
the
Commission IS required to grant a dehstIng appncation The authority of the Comrnrssron In such cases IS limited to the
Imposition of terms deemed necessary
for the protection of Investors 3
The standards for delistrnq vary among
the exchanges,
but generally
delistmq
actions are based on one or more of the
following
factors.
(1) the number of
publicly held shares or shareholders
IS
insufficient (often as a result of an acquisition or merger) to support a broadbased trading
market, (2) the market
value of the outstanding shares or the
trading volume IS Inadequate;
(3) the
company
no longer satisfies
the exchange's cnteria for earnings or financial
condition; or (4) required reports have not
been filed with the exchange.
During fiscal year 1975, the Comrrussron granted exchange applications
for
the delrsnnq of 125 stock Issues and 14
bond Issues The largest number of applications came from the American Stock
Exchange, 41 stocks and 4 bonds The
number of applications
granted
other
exchanges were: New York, 24 stocks
and 8 bonds, Pacific, 16 stocks and 1
bond, National,
15 stocks;

Exchange Disciplinary Actions
The 1975 Amendments
adds a new
Section 19(d) to the Securttres Exchange
Act requmnq exchanges to report to the
Commission, and authorizing
the Comrnissron to review. any final disciplinary
sanction Imposed by an exchange that (I)
denies membership
or participation
to
any applicant, (II) prohibits or limits any
person access to services offered by an
exchange
or member thereof, or (IIi)
Imposes final disciplinary
sanctions on
any person associated with a member or
bars any person from becoming associated with a member. Before the Amendments, the Securities Exchange Act did
not explicitly
authorize the Oommlssion
to review exchange disciplinary
actions,
although
each natronal secuntres
exchange did report voluntarily to the Comrnrssion disciplinary action taken against
members and member firms and their
associated persons.
Durmq the fiscal year, five exchanges
reported a total of 107 separate drscrphnary actions, Including the imposition
In 81 cases of fines ranging from $25.00
to $20,000, the expulsion of 6 individuals;
the suspension
from membership
(for
penods of 3 to 36 months) of 5 member
orqaruzatrons and 8 individual members;
and the censure of 20 member organizations

EXCHANGE RULES
The Commission's staff continually reviews the rules and practices
of the
national securrtres exchanges to determine the adequacy and effectiveness of
the self-regulatory
scheme To facilitate
Commission
oversight,
each
national
secuntres exchange has been required to
file with the Oornrmsston a report of any
proposed change In rules or practices
not less than three weeks (or such shorter
period as the Commission may authorize)
before Implementing
a change
These
filings
have been available for public
inspection

Under the 1975 Amendments, national
securities exchanges are now required to
file with the Commission any proposed
change In exchange rules accompanied
by a concise general statement of the
basis and purpose of such proposed rule
change. In general, the Commission must
then publish notice of the proposed rule
change together with the terms of such
change or a description of the subjects
and issues involved and give interested
parties an opportunity
to submit their
views concerning
such proposed rule
change. No proposed rule change may
take effect unless approved by the CommiSSIOn or otherwise permitted by the
Securities Exchange Act.
DUring the fiscal year, the Commission
received 153 letters from exchanges proposing amendments involving over 500
rules and stated practices. The following
were among the more significant:
1.
All
the
registered
exchanges
adopted rule amendments which provide
for competitive
commission
rates on
public
transactions,
and several
exchanges adopted rule amendments which
provide for competitive commission rates
on intra-member transactions. For further
discussion
of competitive
commission
rates, see Part I.
2. The American
Stock
Exchange
("Amex") and the PBW Stock Exchange
adopted rule changes which allowed the
establishment of odd-lot markets in U.S.
government
debt
obligations
on the
respective exchanges.
3. The New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE")
adopted rule changes which
Increased fees for persons who elected
to utilize the NYSE's arbitration tacrhnes
and also modified
certain
arbitration
procedures.
4. Most of the national stock exchanges
adopted
rule amendments
which
extended their trading hours from 3:30 P M.
to 4:00 P.M. EST
5. The NYSE, the Amex, the Midwest
and
Pacinc
Stock
Exchanges
adopted rule changes which increased
the original and annual maintenance listIng fees paid to the respective exchanges
by companies
which
have securities
listed on those exchanges.

6 The NYSE, the Amex, and their
affiliated clearing corporations submitted
for Commission
review rule changes
designed to Implement continuous
net
settlement systems for the clearing of
exchange-listed
securities. For a further
discussion of the development and operation of continuous
settlement systems,
see Part I
7. The NYSE, the Amex and the Chicago Board Options Exchange adopted
minimum margin maintenance
requirements for options earned by brokerdealers for their customers, as well as for
market makers, specialists or registered
traders
for whom such broker-dealer
clear transactions on an exchange. The
rules of each of the three exchanges
dealt with margining uncovered options
and various spread or hedged option
positions.

EXCHANGE INSPECTIONS
NYSE Specialist Inspection
On June 19, 1974, the Commission's
staff wrote a letter to the NYSE to inform
It of the findings of an inspection of that
exchange's
specialist
surveillance
and
stock allocation
programs which was
begun with a VISit to the NYSE on May
29,1973.4
The letter summarized the DIVIsion's
conclusions
with
respect
to (1) the
NYSE's use of the "New Measures of
Specralrst
Performance"
("New
Measures"), (2) the basis for judging specialist
performance
developed
by the
New Measures, (3) the use of sampling
techniques, (4) the use of disciplinary
action in cases of poor performance, (5)
the allocation of securities to specrallsts
and (6) the need for more complete
minutes of NYSE Floor Committee meetinqs,
On June 16 and 17, 1975, the Commission's staff conducted a further on-site
inspection to review procedures adopted
by the NYSE in response to the staff
letter of June 19, 1974 In a June 26, 1975
letter to the NYSE, the Commission staff,
after noting that only preliminary results
from the inspection were then available,

67

expressed concern that the NYSE apparently dId not Implement procedures to
provide for more detailed and Informative
NYSE Floor Committee minutes until long
after the staff made the request In the
June 19, 1974 letter. In addrtron, the staff
noted that the mitral exchange efforts to
maintain more extensive records snit did
not reflect suttrcrent lnforrnatron about
decisrons.
The staff
stock
allocation
stated that until quesnons relating to the
specialrst
system were resolved satisfactorily, a number of procedures should
be adopted to better enable the NYSE
Board of Directors
to Insure that the
current system of allocating stocks to a
partrcular
specialrst
urut was adrrurustered adequately.
More specrtrcally,
the Commission's
staff suggested that a transcript be kept
of those portions of NYSE Floor Oomrruttee meetings which related to the allocanon or reallocation of stocks to or from
specralrst units or to proposed mergers
of such units. It was also suggested that
the entire record, including copies of all
memoranda and reports considered
by
the Floor
Committee
regarding
such
matters, be made available to the NYSE
Board of Directors along With the Floor
Committee's recommendations,
and that
those recommendations
be supported by
a statement of the factors the Floor Committee considered
In concluding
that a
particular unit, as opposed to any other
Units, should have stocks allocated to It.
The Dlvrsron also urged again that minorIty views be reflected. The Division further requested
an early status report
regarding thiS interim action.

Chicago Board Options
Exchange Inspection
From August 19-22, 1974, members of
the Commission's staff Inspected various
aspects of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange ("caOE")
options pilot program. The purpose of the Inspection was
to gain a general familiarity
With the
operation of the CBOE's floor, including
tracing the handling of an order from the
time of receipt on the floor through ItS
being filled and printed on the transac68

tion tape. The Oornrnlssron's
staff noted
the crowded conditions of the CBOE floor
and reviewed with CBOE ottlcrals their
plans for a new trading floor. In accordance With those plans, the CBOE moved
durinq the frscal year to a new, greatly
enlarged floor which opened for options
trading on December 2,1974.
The Oornrmsslon's staff also took note
of problems relating to the reporting of
options transactions and the inability of
Investors to obtain quotations and last
sale data With respect to options transacinspections. Followinq the Oomrmssron's
tion, the CBOE installed high speed lines
for reporting
transactional
data and,
along With the Amex, engaged the Securities Industry Automation Corporatron as
a central processor for that data. As a
result of the CBOE's corrective measures,
slqrnncant progress has been made toward resotvinq the problems relating to
the reporting of transactional
information
and obtaining quotations and last sales
data
The Cornrnisston's staff also Inspected
program. DurCBOE's floor surveillance
Ing that Inspection, the staff observed the
CBOE's Innovative system of usmq "post
coordinators"
to monitor the performance
of market makers. Under the CBOE's
morutorinq
system,
post
coordinators
stand at each trading post located on the
floor of the exchange to Insure that bids
and offers are properly recorded and to
detect and report possible violations of
exchange rules In the trading crowd. The
Commission's mspection group Informally
recommended expansion of the post coordinator function; because of staff problems, however, the CBOE substantially
eliminated the surveulance role of these
rndrvrduals. At the end of the fiscal year,
the Comrrusslon's staff planned to hold
further diSCUSSIons WIth ofhcials of the
CBOE about reinstating the post coordinator inspection
system. In connection
with the CeOE's floor surverllance, the
Cornmrsston's
staff recommended,
and
the CBOE instituted,
a floor members'
discrplmary
action bulletin to descnbe
actron taken by the BUSiness Conduct
Cornrruttee of the CBOE for VIolations of
floor practice rules and to keep ItS floor

American Stock Exchange
Options Program Inspection
On April 1 and 2, 1975, members of the
Commission's staff conducted an inspection of certain aspects of the Amex pilot
program for listing and trading call options. Special emphasis was given to an
examlnatron
of the Amex's market surveillance of options trading, Its surveillance of registered options traders and
options specialists,
and observation of
options trading as conducted on the exchange floor. The Commission's
staff
also examined the Amex's methods for
conducting Inquiries into such matters as
unusual trading activity and/or vrolatrons
(if any) of exchange rules of policy.
Partly as a result of tms Inspection, the
Commission's staff recommended that the
Amex elaborate upon the responsibilities
of floor members in assisting the specialist in his options market-making capacity.
The Amex responded that it would again
inform all parties, i.e., registered traders,
specialists,
and floor brokers, of their
obligations In that regard.s Furthermore,
through a special exchange bulletin on
this subject sent to its floor members, the
Amex outlined ItS policies concerning the
responsibilities of those mernbers."

Preliminary Inspection of
Contemplated PBW Option Pilot
On June 23 and 24, 1975, the Commission's staff conducted a preliminary inspection of the PBW Stock Exchange,
Inc. ("PBW") pilot program for trading
call options. The mspectron was conducted during the PBW's test simulation
program, before the actual initiation of
trading. The staff paid particular attention to the adequacy of exchange facilities
and market surveillance
systems. The
Commission's
staff found two possible
Impediments to future expansion of the
PBW's option pilot. The first was that the
use of a manual floor display of market
quotations on a chalkboard rather than
on a cathode ray tube might prove to be

inefficient In a period of heavy trading.
Secondly, the staff questioned whether
presently
available
floor space could
accommodate additional option classes
beyond the 10 initially authorized NYSElisted common stocks. These matters
were to be discussed with PBW officials
early in the next fiscal year.

SUPERVISION

OF NASD

The Securities Exchange Act provides
that any association of brokers or dealers
may be registered with the Commission
If It
as a national securities associatron
meets the standards and requirements
for the registration and operation of such
assocrations contained In the Act. The
Act contemplates that such associations
will serve as a medium for self-regulation
by over-the-counter brokers and dealers.
In order to be eligible for registration, an
association must have rules desrqned to
protect Investors and the public Interest,
to promote just and equitable princrples
of trade and to meet other statutory requrrernents, Registered national securities
associatrons
operate under the Commission's
general
supervisory
authority,
which Includes the power to review disCiplinary actions taken by an aSSOCiatIOn,
to disapprove
changes In associatron
rules and to alter or supplement rules
relating to specrtied matters The National
Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc.
("NASD"), IS the only assocratron registered with the Commission under the
Act.
In adopting legislation to permit the
forrnatron and registration
of nationat
securitles
assocratrons, Congress provided an incentive to membership by
permitting
such associations
to adopt
rules which preclude any member from
dealing With a nonmember broker or
dealer except on the same terms and conditions and at the same prices as the
member deals with the general pubhc.
The NASD has adopted such rules. As a
practical matter, therefore, membership
IS necessary for profitable participation
since members
In many underwntlnqs,
properly may grant only to other members
price concessions, discounts and similar
69

allowances
not granted to the general
public.
By the close of the fiscal year, the number of NASD firms had declined by almost
11 percent from the previous year, leavIng 2,991 members, a net loss of 327
members dunnq the year This loss reflects the net result of 158 adrrussrons to
and 485 terrrnnanons of rnembershrp. The
number of members' branch offices decreased by 224, to 5,924 as a result of
the opening of 834 new offices and the
In the
closinq of 1,058. The reduction
number of members and branch offices
and the consolidation
of others resulted
generally In larger and better capitalized
orgamzalJons. During the fiscal year, the
number of reqistered representalJves and
prrncipals (these categories
Include all
partners, officers, traders, salesmen and
other persons employed by or affiliated
with member nrrns In capacities
which
require reqrstratton)
decreased by 9,393
to 197,702 as of June 30, 1975. ThIS decrease reflects the net result of 14,011
inItial registrations, 19,527 re-reqistranons
and 42,931 terrrunanons of registration
during the year
DUring the trscal year, the NASD administered 40,576 quanncanon
examinations of which 21,799 were for NASD
qualification,
3,052 for the Commission's
SECD program 7 and the balance for
other agencies, including major exchanges
and various states

NASD Rules
Under the Securities Exchange Act, as
In effect before the enactment of the 1975
Amendments, the NASD was required to
file for Commission review copies of proposed rules or rule amendments 30 days
prior to their proposed
effectiveness."
Any rule changes or additions
may be
disapproved by the Comrrusaron If It finds
them to be inconsistent with the requirements of the Act Generally, the Commrssron

During
the
fiscal
year,
numerous
changes in or additions to NASD rules
were submitted to the Commission for ItS
consrderatrcn.
Among the major filings
which
were not disapproved
by the
Commission were.
1. Amendments to Schedule D of the
NASD's By-laws relating
to the Initial
of secuntles
In
standards for mclusron
the NASDAQ system. The minimum number of shareholders
was reduced from
500 to 300 It had become Increasingly
difficult for new Issues to meet the higher
500 shareholder
test because of the
emphasis within the Industry on the practice of holding securities in "street name."
At the same time the price of the security
was eliminated as a criterion for inclusion
in NASDAQ. This major liberalization
of
the requirements
was made because It
was felt that the safeguards that are imposed by other applicable NASDAQ Criteria,
such
as the Section
12(g)( 1)
registration 9 and the assets and net
worth standards, as well as the NASD's
continuing and Improved market surveillance programs, are sufficient to prevent
the various abuses at which the price
criterion was aimed.
2. Amendments to Schedule D of the
NASD's By-laws to provide for the elrrrunanon of the minimum bid quotation requirements for Issues on the National lists for
over-the-counter
secuntrss
published
In
newspapers and other media. The principal effect of trus amendment was to
allow the NASD, in face of lower market
prices during the past two years, to continue to utilize available newspaper space
for the Natronal LIsts.
3. Amendments to Schedule C of the
NASD's By-laws providing for the establishment
of new NASD qualification
examinations for representatives
engagIng In general secuntres
activities.
In
order to upgrade the qualification
standards for secunnes
industry personnel
and to develop tests surted to specific
categories of persons, the NASD, along
with the NYSE, developed a new comprehensive
examination
for
general
securities representatives.
The examrnanon consists of two 125 question parts
and IS given In separate three-hour ses-

srons, The examination
IS divided Into
four subject matter areas: Industry Regulation and Brokerage Office Procedures,
Product Knowledge, Financial and Security Analysis, and the Servicmq
of
Accounts. In addition, the NASD IS developing separate examinations,
which
would be given In lieu of the new general securities examination to individuals
selling only special types of securities
such as mutual funds, variable life and
annuity contracts, or limited partnership
interests.
4. Amendments to Schedule A of the
NASD's By-laws providing for an Increase
In the gross income assessment rate for
member firms, and for a special service
examinations adcharge for qualrtrcatron
ministered by the NASD In its foreign test
centers. The gross income assessment
levy is a. means used by the NASD to
provide for the equitable allocation of
dues among its members to defray reasonable expenses of administration
The
service charge for foreign test centers
was Imposed to cover the additional
expenses Involved In administering such
a program.
5. Amendments to Schedule G of the
By-laws governing the reporting by members of over-the-counter
transactions In
listed securities to the consolidated tape,
and amendments to the By-laws, Operating Rules and Interim Rules of the National Clearing Corporation were adopted
to facilitate reportmq.t?

NASD Inspections
During the fiscal year, the Commission's staff Inspected the NASD's district
offices in Philadelphia and Chicago, and
commenced an inspection of the operations of ItS NASDAQ and Market Surveillance
Departments
located
In ItS
Washington headquarters office
Those
inspections were conducted as a part of
the Commission's oversight responsibilities to assure that the NASD IS properly
carrymq out ItS self-regulatory functions,
and to coordinate
with the NASD in
regulating and enforcing activities in the
over-the-counter markets.
The district office lnspectrons Involved

a review of (1) the composition and effectiveness of the District Committees, the
District Business Conduct Committees,
examination
subcommittees,
nominating
committees and quotations committees;
(2) the functioning of the district staffs,
especially their working relationships with
the various committees; (3) the district
staffs' coordination and cooperation with
the Commission's
reqional otnces, exchanges and other interested regulatory
bodies; (4) the effectiveness of drscrpunary procedures; and (5) the need, If any,
for new rules or amendments to existing
rules, policies
or interpretations.
The
Inspection of the operations of NASDAQ
and Market Surveillance Departments involved a review of similar areas of concern, with particular concentration on the
effectiveness of the NASDAQ regulatory
procedures
necessary to protect
and
promote a fair and orderly marketplace
of the NASD's PhilaThe rnspectron
dalptua district office revealed several
areas of concern which the staff felt
merited further discussion
with representatives from the NASD's headquarters
office. Spectflcally, the staff noted problems In the totlowmq areas: (1) delays In
the preparation and subsequent processIng of formal complaint actions against
firms and rndrvrduals, (2) the adequacy of
follow-up inquiries based on notices received py the NASD of registered representative
terminations
of employment
with member firms; and (3) a lack of
communications
with the Commission
concerning
possible
securrties
acts
violations
These matters were discussed
with
representatives of the NASD In response
to the problem of timely processing of
formal complaint actions, the NASD has
made personnel changes In the Philadelphia district and added an attorney to the
district staff to help in reducrnq backlogs.
In response to the other problems, the
NASD has Indicated to the Commission's
staff that greater depth would be sought

of registered representative termination

Commission concerning possrble securities acts vrolanons
71

An inspection of the NASD's Chicago
district office also revealed certain areas
of concern warranting drscussron with the
NASD's headquarters office. Specifically,
the staff noted problems In the following
areas: (1) possible over-representation
of
exchange-oriented
firms on the District
Committee; (2) some delays In the preparation of formal complaint actions and In
the writing of District Busrness Conduct
Committee
("DSCC")
decrsrons against
(3) Imposition by
firms and indrvrduals:
the DSCC of apparently insufficient sanctions In certain cases, (4) delays by the
staff In presentation of disciplinary
matters to the DSCC In several Instances;
(5) a continuing
reluctance on the part
of the District to utilize the Letters of Admrssron, Waiver and Consent 11 procedure
In appropriate cases In accordance With
headquarters
policy; and (6) a possrble
need for more frequent DSCC meetings In
order to provide for more ettrcient
disposition of ItS disciplinary caseload.
While a report on these findings tias
been prepared and the Commission's staff
sent a preliminary
letter to the NASD,
these matters have not yet been discussed In detail With NASD representatives. A meeting With the NASD Will be
scheduled for early in the next fiscal year.

NASD Disciplinary Actions
The Oornrmssron
receives
from the
NASD copies of ItS dactsrons In all cases
where disciplinary actron IS taken against
members and persons assocrated With
members. Generally,
such actions are
based on allegations
that the respondents Violated specttred provisions of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice. Where
Violations by a member are found, the
NASD may Impose such penalties
as
exputsron,
suspension, fine, or censure.
If the Violator IS an mdrvidual, his registration With the NASD may be suspended
or revoked, he may be suspended
or
barred from being associated
With any
member or he may be fined and/or
censured.
DUring the past fiscal year, the NASD
reported to the Cornrrnssron ItS final dis72

position of 486 disciplinary complaints In
which 330 members and 553 rndrvrduals
were named as respondents. Complaints
against 23 members and 53 individuals
were dismissed for failure to establish
the alleged violations. Forty-stx members
were expelled from membership and 24
members were suspended
for periods
ranging from one day to one year. In
many of these cases, a fine also was Imposed. In 210 cases, members were fined
amounts ranging from $25 to $50,000 and
In 27 cases members were censured. In
discrplmary
sanctions
Imposed on individuals associated With member firms,
142 persons were barred or had their
registrations
revoked and 91 had their
registrations suspended for periods rangIng from one day to eight years. In
were cenaddition, 243 other mdrvicuats
sured and/or fined In amounts ranging
from $100 to $50,000.

Review of NASD Disciplinary
Actions
DIsciplinary action taken by the NASD
IS subject to review of the Oornmlsaron
on ItS own motion or on the timely application of any aggrieved person. In those
cases reViewed by the Commission

disposed of 11 cases.
The Oornrmssron
In SIX cases the Commission affirmed the
NASD's action and In two other cases

dismissed the appeal because of respondent's failure to file a brief. In two
cases, the NASD's findings and/or penalties were modified and In one case the
NASD's action was set aside. At the close
of the fiscal year, 31 cases were pending.
In Thomas E. Jackson,13 the Cornrnrssron, affirming the NASD, held that a
registered representative
can be dlscrplrned for conduct not arising directly
out of securities actrvmes. Jackson was
charged with violating the requirement of
the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice that
members and associated persons adhere
to "high standards of commercial honor
and just and equitable
principles
of
trade",14 because he forged the signatures on applications

that Jackson's conduct obviously did not
meet such standards.

why the NASD should be precluded from
carrying out Its mandate to protect its
members and their customers against a
repetition of the kind of conduct in which
Jackson engaged. In addition, the Commlssron noted that although Jackson's
wrong-doing in this Instance did not involve securities acnvmes, the NASD could
Justifiably conclude that on another occasion it might.
In Livada Securities CO.,15 the Comrmssion affirmed the NASD's findings that
the respondent violated the net capital
rule and failed to prepare and maintain
proper books and records. It sustained
the fine Imposed by the NASD despite the
respondent's contention that the penal-

ties were excessive In light of various
mitigating circumstances, t.e., the violanons were Inadvertent and attributable
In part to respondent's inexperience and
there were no customer losses. The Comrrussron observed that the Issue before
It was not whether it would have Imposed
the same sanctions as the NASD, but
whether the penalties Imposed were excessive or oppressive, having due regard
for the public Interest The Commission
stated that It was in full accord with the
NASD's stress on the Importance of a
firm's compliance with the net capital and
recordkeepmq
requirements. The Commission emphasized,
furthermore,
that
the net capital rule, which was designed
to assure financial responsibility of brokers and dealers, has been described as
"one of the most Important weapons in
the Commission's arsenal to protect investors," 16and that accurate and current
records are essential to enable a brokerdealer to determine compliance with net
capital and other requirements.

Review of NASD Membership
Action
Before the enactment
of the 1975
Amendments,
the Securities
Exchange
Act and NASD By-laws provided that,
unless approved by the Commission, no
broker or dealer could become or continue to be an NASD member If It or any
person associated with It was subject to
Commission action

to approve or direct the admission of a
person to membership in the NASD, or
the continuance of membership of any
person, IS generally sought after an initial
petition to the NASD IS made by the
member or applicant
for membership.
The NASD in ItS discretion may then file
an application with the Commission on
behalf of the petitioner. If the NASD refuses to sponsor the application,
the
broker or dealer may apply directly to the
Ocrnrnisston
for an order directing the
NASD to admit It to, or to continue it In,
membership. At the beginning of the fiscal
year, four applications were pending before the Commission. During the year,
seven applications were filed, five were
73

approved and two were withdrawn, leavIng four applications pending at the end
of the year. All of the applications were
filed by the NASD

the Cornmlsston
IS not at liberty to substitute Its discretion for that of the NASD.

NASDAQ Issuer Removal

EXPENSES AND OPERATIONS
OF SELF-REGULATORY
ORGANIZATIONS

On March 13, 1975, the Commission
Issued an order dismissing review proceedings on an application for review by
Tassaway, lnc.J" a publicly held company
whose common stock was removed from
the NASD's automated quotation system
("NASDAQ"),19 because the issuer failed
to maintain at least $250,000 In capital
plus surplus, as required by NASD rules
Tassaway's application under Securities
Exchange Act Rule 15AJ-2 for review of
ItS removal from NASDAQ was the first
ever made to the Commission
by a
NASDAQ issuer. Tassaway conceded ItS
failure
to meet NASDAQ's
numerical
qualitative test 20 but argued that a proposed acqulsmon would, when consummated, give It more than enough capital
to meet NASDAQ's capital test. In view of
the fact that the acqursmon agreement
was rescinded dunnq the pendency of
the appeal, the Commission ordered that
the proceeding be dismissed.
Since this was the Commission's first
such appeal, however, It took the opportunity to state the basic standards by
which It would be gUided when asked to
review the NASD's actions With respect to
exaccess to NASDAQ. The Ccrnmlsston
pressed the view that the NASD's role In
NASDAQ IS, In essence, the same as that
of exchanges With respect to the listing
and dellstrnq of securities
and, citing
prior decrsrons on the latter subject, the
Commission concluded that the governing
legal standards should be the same, I.e.,
(1) though exclusion from the system may
hurt exisnnq Investors, primary emphasis
must be placed on the Interest of prospective future Investors 21; (2) the Commission's review function IS solely that of
determining whether "the specrtrc grounds
on which the action of the self-regulatory
organization is based exrst In fact and
are In accord With the applicable rules
of the association", and (3) to the extent
that discretion
enters Into the matter,

The year 1974 was a poor one for the
secunnes markets In general, and the
major self-regulatory
organizations
suffered financially as a result.22 The high
national rate of inflation seems to have
been a primary Influence on the markets
during the year.
In an inflationary period, It can normally
be expected
that expenses, such as
wages and salaries, Will rise in accord
with the general inflation rate; and durIng 1974 ttus was the case with the NYSE
and the NASD, whose expenses are
heavily weighted With personnel costs, as
might be expected of a regulatory body.
Many industries, however, pass on these
Increased costs through higher prices for
the goods and services they market. The
secunties
Industry, however, IS almost
totally a service Industry and must finance
ItS self-regulatory
effort
very largely
through fees and assessments levied on
persons engaged In the business. Its
revenues, in turn, depend upon, and
fluctuate With, the price and volume levels
of the secunnes being marketed. The
self-regulatory organizations, whose revenues must depend, in the final analysis,
on the profitability of their member firms
were caught in the middle. Their revenues
declined while their expenses were increasing In line With the high rate of
inflation.
Cost-cutting measures were introduced
by most self-regulatory
organizations to
meet this problem; nevertheless, particularly in the case of the NYSE and the
NASD, those measures were not fully
adequate because of their need to meet
on-going and increasing regUlatory and
surveillance responsibilities.
Total share volume of secunties traded
on all national securities exchanges and
over-the-counter continued to decline In
1974, amounting
to approximately
6.0
billion shares In 1974 as compared With
7.4 and 8.5 billion shares In 1973 and

74

1972, respectively. As a group, the selfregulatory organizations'
combined total
revenues declined to $173 mrlnon in 1974
from $180 million In 1972, as a result
mostly of the decrease In trading volume.
Communication fees, however, rose from
$19 million to $21 million, and revenue
from depository
fees Increased by $3
million pnmanly because of the activity
of a newly formed Midwest Stock Exchange subsidiary,
the Midwest Stock
Trust Company. Changes In various other
revenue components were as follows.
Revenues on transactions fees declined to $24 million from $29 million;
Revenues on listing fees declined to
$25 rrullron from $26 million;
Revenues from cleanng fees declined
to $30 million from $36 million;
Revenues from tabulating
services
declined to $11 million from $12 million; and
Revenues from all "other" sources
increased
to $39 million
from $38
million
because of an Increase
In
membership dues 23
Thus, the self-regulatory
organizations
as a group suffered a net loss of $1.1
million (before taxes) In 1974 as opposed
to net Income of $2.2 million and $18.9
million In 1973 and 1972, respectively
In
the first SIX months of 1975, however, the
situation Improved In line With the increased market activity, resulting In net
income before taxes of $12.1 million.

Financial Results of the NASD
Each year the Commission reviews the
NASO's proposed fee and assessment
schedule, ItS supporting financial statements for the current and past fiscal
years, and proposed budget for the following fiscal year. The fee and assessment schedule is filed pursuant to Section
15A of the Securitres Exchange Act, which
requires the NASO to have an equitable
allocation of dues among ItS members to
defray reasonable expenses of administration.
The NASO's statement of financial reSUlts for ItS fiscal year ended September
3D, 1974, revealed that the NASO's equity

declined to $7.8 million from $8.4 million
the year before. The decline In equrty
resulted from lower net operating earnIngs and a larger loss Incurred by the
National
Clearing
Corporation,
the
NASO's wholly-owned clearing Subsidiary,
which was charged to NASO earnings.
Operating revenues of the NASO declined by $0.5 million to $12.2 million, a
decline ot 4%. This reduction In income
was brought about by two major factors.
First, a major source of revenue, fees
charged for administering
qualification
exarmnatrons given pnnclpally
to mdivrduals entenng the business, declined
25%, to $3.1 million in fiscal year 1974,
versus $4.1 million In fiscal year 1973.
The number of examinees declined from
72,598 In fiscal year 1973 to 47,212 In
fiscal year 1974. Secondly, because of
poor market conditions, the number of
firms haVing public offenngs
declined
Significantly.
The total dollar value of
public offerings in which NASO members
participated
fell to $8.65 billion from
$14.1 billion In fiscal year 1973, a 53%
decline. Thrs decline caused a drop In
NASO fees for underwntmq arrangements
filed With it for review during the NASO's
fiscal year. Other NASO revenues were
stable, except for a new revenue source
that went Into effect on June 1, 1974the NASOAQ Issuer fee, which brought In
$0.7 rnillron.
Operating
expenses
of the NASO
dropped by $0.2 million (to $12.1 million
In the NASO's 1974 fiscal year from $12.3
million In its 1973 fiscal year) largely as
a result of vanous cost-cutting measures
taken by It. Thus, the decreases In operatIng revenues and expenses resulted In
net operating Income of $0 1 million as
opposed to $0.4 million In the prior year,
down but stili POSitive, until the net NCC
loss of $0.7 million ($0.3 million In the
NASO's 1973 fiscal year) IS taken Into
account.sThiS addrnonat
expense put
the NASO In a net loss posrtron of $0.6
million In ItS 1974 fiscal year as opposed
to a profit of $0.1 million In fiscal year
1973.
More recently, the high trading volume
for the first six months of 1975 resulted
in higher gross revenues and net income
75

for the NASD Over that six-month period,
both revenues and net Income before
taxes gradually
Increased, providing a
January-to-June gross revenue In excess
of $10 million. Expenses, on the other
hand, remained relatively stable dunnq
this period, resulting In net Income of
$0.6 million for the period.

NASD Budget
The review of the NASD budget IS conducted as a part of the Commission's
regulatory oversight responsibilities,
and
dunnq the past two years the Commission
has been concerned very largely with the
program
for examination
of member
broker-dealers to assure that the NASD
has a sufficient examiner staff to carry
out ItS enforcement
and surveillance
responsibilities.
In addition to ItS usual budget subrrussron, In September 1974, the NASD submitted
a "Personnel
BUdget Study",
which outlined the NASD's projected staff
requirements for ItS fiscal year ending
September 30,1975 That study concluded
that a total of 168 field examiners, not
Including those needed to staff such departments and sections as Internal Review and Anti-Fraud, were needed to
complete the 1975 exarnmanon program.
Selective reductions of certain professronal and clerical positions, as recommended In that study, were made to
reduce the total authorized field staff
from 349 In the NASD's 1974 fiscal year
to 285 In ItS 1975 fiscal year. That was a
net budgeted decline of 64 positrons (47
professional and 17 clerical) With respect
to field staff then on board, however, the
study had recommended a reduction In
force of only 34 positrons (22 professional
and 12 clerical)
The recommended
reduction
was a
marked change
from a 1973 NASD
personnel bUdget study, which had indicated that the examination program for
1974 would require 213,373 examiner
man-hours for completion. The 1974 study
concluded
that the fiscal
year 1975
examination program would require only
156,058 man-hours for cornplenon. Several factors accounted for that projected
76

decrease in staff. First, the number of
firms In the association's highest priority
category, i.e., member firms doing a general securities business whose only affiliation with a self-regulatory
organization
IS the NASD, dropped appreciably during
the year (from 1,208 in 1973 to 1,010,
or a decrease of 198 firms). That decline
resulted In a "saving" of 15,246 examination man-hours, or 26.6% of the total
1973-1974 difference
Secondly, the reduction
In required
man-hours for 1974 was partially
the
outgrowth of positive enforcement programs In being since 1973, which resulted
In a decrease In the number of firms on
special survelliance,25 i.e., a decrease
from 90 firms In April 1973 to 48 In April
1974 That resulted in a saving of slightly
under 7,000 man-hours, or approximately
12% of the 1973-1974 difference
Additionally,
since the Commission's
adoption of a rule about control of customers' secunties (Securities Exchange
Act Rule 15c3-3) In January 1973, the
staff of the NASD has encouraged members to operate pursuant to exemptions
afforded by that rule. The NASD estimates
that over 200 firms availed themselves of
such exemptions, which permitted a reduction In man-hours required for examination of such firms of approximately
8,500 hours, or 15% of the 1973-1974
difference. Also, the NASD eliminated the
three-year routine examination frequency
cycle for mutual-fund retailers, which reduced the workload
by approximately
8,938 examiner man-hours, or 15% of the
difference.
Finally, estimates as to the required
amount of time for examination of different
categories of members were reVised In
the 1974 study. Those revrsrons were
based on actual experience gained over
the most
recent
eight-month
period
through the use of the NASD's new timerecording
system. That resulted in a
decrease of approximately
17,839 manhours, or 31.3% of the 57,315 man-hour
difference In the two studies.

Financial Results of the NYSE
In 1974, the NYSE had net operating

revenues of $0.66 million, on total revenues of $72.6 million, as compared with
net operating revenues of $3.7 million on
gross revenues of $78.0 rrullron In 1973.
In addition, the NYSE had a tax credit of
$221,000, equity In net revenues of the
Depository Trust Company of $552,000,
and a credit to capital of $990,000 from
initiation fees, for a total of $1.7 million,
resulting In an increase in equity to $62.8
million from $61.0 million in 1973. In the
prior
year,
the
NYSE's
equity
had
increased by $4.5 mlllron.
As in the case of the NASD, declining
revenues as a result of poor market conditions for members In 1974 was the
primary
reason for significantly
lower
operating revenues, which decreased by
$5.3 million from the previous year to
$72.7 million, a decline of nearly 7%. A
decline
in revenue from two sources
made up the bulk of this decrease. First,
charges on commissions declined by $2.0
million, to $17.0 million from $19.0 million
the previous year. This was a direct result
of reduced trading activity on the NYSEi.e., average dally volume fell from a
dally average of 16.1 million shares In
1973 to 13.9 million shares In 1974, a decline of 14%. Secondly, Initial listing fees
declined by $32 million, from $10.8 million In 1973 to $7.6 million In 1974. There
were only 48 new listings In 1974 as
against 98 In 1973 (which was also a
poor year for new listings). This loss In
initial listing fee revenue was offset In
part by an increase In continuous listing
fee revenue of $0.8 million. Thus, there
was a net decline of $2.4 million In total
listing fee revenue In 1974, to $18.9 million from $21.3 million in 1973. The NYSE's
other revenue sources, including
commurucations
charges and cleanng serVices, also yielded less In the aggregate,
declining by a total of $0.7 million.
Partly as a result of decreased activity
on the exchange and partly because of
cost-cutting measures, the NYSE reduced
ItS operating
expenses by $1 7 million
(2.3%). The NYSE reduced expenditures
significantly In the following areas.
1. Reduction
in leased tacrlrties and
equipment expenses by $1.6 million;
2. Elimination of the block automation

system, saving $2.2 mrtlron:
3. Reduction In legal expenses by $2.3
million;
4. Elimination
of the NYSE's national
advertismq program, saving $1.5 million;
5. Reduction of staff 26 by a total of
280 people, saving $4.5 million; and
6. Reduction of other expenses by $1.0
million.
These savings were offset partially by
an salary Increases of $2.2 million.
Dunng the first SIX months of 1975 the
NYSE expenenced
an Increase in total
revenues as share volume Increased from
388 million shares traded In January to
479 million shares traded In June. Expenses dunng thrs perrod were held to
$48 rmllron,
producing
a pre-tax
net
Income of $8.4 million for the SIX months.

Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago
Board Options Exchange, and
Midwest Stock Exchange 27
In contrast to the NYSE and the NASD,
the Boston Stock Exchange ("BSE"), the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
("CBOE"),
and the Midwest Stock Exchange ("MSE")
expenenced
increases
In revenues between 1973 and 1974. The
MSE Increase was caused pnmanly by
expansion of services offered to ItS members. The CBOE Increase was generated
charges on inmainly from cornrrussron
creased volume In listed option trading.
The BSE Increase was the result of a
general nse In all sources of revenue. Expenses also Increased dunng thrs penod,
resulting In a decline In net Income before
taxes between 1973 and 1974, except In
the case of the CBOE, which reduced ItS
losses In 1974 relative to 1973. Revenue
rntormatron
for the MSE for the first five
months of 1975 showed an Increase,
dipping only slightly In June. Expenses
for the MSE during these SIX months were
relatively stable. MSE net Income from
operations
for the first
SIX months,
which fluctuated to some degree, totaled
$0.8 million. Likewrse, CBOE and BSE
expenenced greater revenues in the first
SIX months of 1975 Expenses for BSE
remained
stable
while
those for the
CBOE rose because of higher salary costs.
77

Net Income for the first SIX months of
1975 was $0.2 million for the BSE and
$0.8 million for the CBOE

American Stock Exchange, Detroit
Stock Exchange, PBW Stock
Exchange and Spokane Stock
Exchange
The Amex, the Detroit Stock Exchange
("DSE"),
the
PBW
Stock
Exchange
("PBW"),
and the Spokane
Stock Exchange ("SSE") all experienced a decline
In revenues and expenses between 1973
and 1974, primarily because of low exchange volume and generally unfavorable
market conditions
Nevertheless, the first
SIX months of 1975 showed a reversal of
the downward trend for these exchanges.
Only the PBW showrnq renewed signs of
decline In May and June Both the DSE
and the SSE showed steadily declining
expenses dUring the first half of 1975,
while PBW and Amex expenses experienced an overall upswing. Of those four
exchanges, only the SSE showed a loss
for the fl rst SIX months of 1975. The
Amex, DSE and the PBW had net Incomes
of $0.5 rnrltron, $4,000 and $0.3 rrullron,
respectively

Cincinnati Stock Exchange,
Intermountain Stock Exchange,
and Pacific Stock Exchange
The
("CSE"),

Cincinnati
Stock
Intermountain
Stock

Exchange
Exchange

("ISE"), and the Pacinc Stock Exchange
("PSE") all Increased their revenues and
decreased thei r expenses between 1973
and 1974. The revenue Increase for CSE
came primarily from listing fees and floor
usage revenues The slight rise In revenues for the ISE came entirety from rental
Income. The rise In revenues for the PSE
was due to Increases In member dues,
listing fees, and earnings from investments. The rise In revenues for those
exchanges caused all three to experience
Increases In net Income between 1973
and 1974.
DUring the first SIX months of 1975, the
CSE revenues and expenses varied consrdarably, resulting In a net loss for two
78

of the SIX months. The ISE experienced
declining
revenues dUring the first SIX
months of 1975. ThiS, combined
With
fluctuating
expenses, resulted In losses
for four of the SIX months. The PSE on
the other hand, experienced
an upward
movement In total revenues dUring the
first SIX months of 1975 Expenses for
the PSE also increased, but the Increases
did not prevent the PSE from operating
at a pront for the first half of 1975.
The combined revenues and expenses
of all the exchanges and the NASD for
the years 1972, 1973 and 1974, and for
the months of January

June,
1975, are presented In tables In part 9.

BROKER-DEALER
Registration

REGULATION

Brokers and dealers who use the malls
or a means of interstate commerce In the
conduct of an Interstate over-the-counter
secuntrss
busmess are required to reqrster With the Commisslon.28
As of June 30, 1975, there were 3,546
broker-dealers
registered, compared with
3,982 a year earlier. This represents a
decrease of 436, or 10.9 percent, since
June 30, 1974. During the year, 709 registrations were terminated,
of which 576,
or 81 2 percent, were WIthdrawn by the
broker-dealer
and 133, or 18 8 percent,
were revoked or cancelled by the Commissron.
During
the
year,
274 new
applications
became effective, whrle 235
new applications
were either Withdrawn,
returned, or denied.
On May 16, 1975,29 the comrntssron
announced the adopnon of Form U-3, a
uniform application
for reqlstratron as a
broker-dealer
under Section 15(b) of the
Securities
Exchange
Act and for the
amendment of that registration. Form U-3
replaced Form BD, but the desrqnatron
"Form BD" has been retained. The Comrmssion
also
announced
adoption
of
applrcatron
for
Form u-4, a urntorrn
registration of associated persons, which
will replace Form SECD-2.3o

In addition, Secunties
Exchange Act
Rule 15b3-1 was amended to provide
that each registered
broker-dealer
be
required to file new Form BD (that IS,
Form U-3 as adopted) furnishing all required information
at such time as the
broker-dealer's
registration
presently on
file requires amendment. In any case, a
new Form BD would be required to be
filed within 120 days after the effectIve
date of the amendment to Rule 15b3-1.
Paragraph (a)(3) of Securities Exchange
Act Rule 15b8-1 was amended to require
that any broker or dealer whose Form
SECD-2 becomes Inaccurate or incomplete for any reason file a Form U-4
Form U-4 would not have to be filed for
associated persons within any specified
time.
On July 10, 1975, the Commission postponed .the effective
date of the new
forms and the amendments to the related
rules until October 1, 1975, and made
certain changes in the forms and rules,
including changes In Form BD required
by the 1975 Act Arnendments.»

Recordkeeping
On May 7, 1975,32 the Commission proposed amendments to a portron of Securities Exchange Act Rule 17a-3. Rule 17a3(a)(12)(A)(8) presently requires brokers
and dealers to obtain for each associated
person a record of any arrests, indictfor any felony or
ments, or convrctions
misdemeanor,
except
minor tratnc ofproposed
to
fenses
The Oornrmssron
amend Rule 17a-3(a)(12)(A)(8)
to limit
the reference to arrests or Indictments
for crimes whrch were related to the safe
operation of the securities industry. The
rule WIll continue to require employers In
the securrtles industry to maintain records
of all convictions other than minor trattic
offenses of their associated persons

Financial Responsibility
On January 23, 1975,33 the Comrrusston
announced that it had under consrderation a proposal to amend Secunties Exchange Act Rule 15c3-2. Presently Rule
15c3-2 prohibits a broker or dealer from

usmq customer free credit balances In tus
business, unless the customer IS given
notice at least once every three months
informing him of the sum due and that
such funds. (1) are not segregated; (2)
may be used In the operation
of the
broker-dealer's
business.
and (3) are
payable upon demand
With the adoption of Securitres
Exchange Act Rule
15c3-3,34 which
limits
the extent
to
which a broker-dealer
can use customer
funds or secuntres In the operatron of hrs
the drsciosures
required
by
busrness,
Rule 15c3-2 are no longer appropriate
Rule 15c3-3 permits the use of customer
funds only In limited areas of the brokerdealer's business relating to the renderIng of services to customers. Funds not
used In those limited areas are required
to be deposited In a "Special
Reserve
Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of
Customers."
The proposal to amend Rule 15c3-2
would require any broker or dealer subject to the Rule to send to ItS customers a
quarterly statement of account reflecting
any money balances held for the customer's account, securities positions and
secunties transactions In the customer's
account.
The
proposed
amendments
would further require a broker or dealer
to disclose,
among other things, that
customers' free credit balances and fullypaid securmes are available to customers
In the normal course of business operations following
demand and that the
broker or dealer may use any customers'
free credit balances left With It In the
business of such broker or dealer except
as limited by Rule 15c3-3 The Commission IS presently considering
the comments received on the proposed rule

Broker-Dealer

Examinations

DUring the past few years the Commission has continued
to ernphasize
the
Importance of a strong requlatory
program aimed at Improving and raIsing the
regulatory standards In the industry, informing all registered broker-dealers
of
and, where approtherr responsibrlmes
priate, detecting
infractions
and deviations from
the regulatory
rules
and
79

standards which have been established to
protect the investing publrc The Commission IS aided In ItS efforts by examiners who are employed by the various
self-regulatory
organizations
and who
carry out exarmnatrons, inspections and
related functions A result of that effort
has been a substantial decrease In the

The Commission's
Office of BrokerDealer Examination
Program, recently
redesignated as the Office of BrokerDealer Compliance and Examination, In
the Divrsron of Market Regulation,
IS
charged with carrying out the Commission's program to Insure compliance by
broker-dealers
With applicable
rules
relating to supervrsron, sales practices,
trading practices, suttabilrty, books and
records, financial responsibility and other
related activities. During the past fiscal
year, the Office of Broker-Dealer Compliance and Examination has expanded
ItS efforts to Insure that the secuntres
Industry has an up-to-date, comprehensive
early
warning
and surveillance
system and examination and examiner
training programs

Early Warning and Surveillance
The Commission IS responsible for the
financial and operational soundness of all
registered broker-dealers
and members
of self-regulatory
orqaruzations
In thrs
connectron, pursuant to secnon 5(a) of
the Securities Investor Protection Act of
1970 (the "SIPA Act"), the Commission
requires monthly or more frequent earlywarnang lists from each self-regulatory
orqaruzanon
Identifying
member nrms
whrcn may be In or approaching financial
difficulty or whrch may require closerthan-normal surveillance for any reason.
Ttus information IS collected on a monthly
basis and sent It to the appropriate Com80

mission regional office for Verification. A
continuing
monitoring
program
With
respect to firms on the early-warning list
IS subsequently undertaken In cooperation With the self-regulatory
organizations.
Other Commission early warning and
surveillance tools used during the fiscal
year Included (1) Secuntres Exchange
Act Rule 17a-11, which requires a brokerdealer to notify the Commission If it
breaks through certain specified financial
or operational parameters, (2) Securities
Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(j), which requires a broker-dealer.
to notify the
Commission If ItS exemption from the
Commission's net capital rule has ceased
because It no longer IS a member of a
national securities
exchange;
and (3)
Securities Exchange Act Rule 17a-1O,
which requires a broker-dealer
to file
Form X-17A-10 annually With the Comrnlssron. The Commission continues to
monitor these programs, although some
or all of them may eventually be incorporated Into the Financial and Operatronal Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS)
Report Program being developed for the
Industry
by the Report
coordinating
Group.
The Commission periodically
reviews
through on-site mapections and an-house
studies the early warning surveillance
tools of the self-regulatory orqanizations
to Insure that they constitute
sound,
effective
programs
which will enable
each orqaruzatron at the earliest possible
time to detect and monitor member firms
which are an or approachang financial
difficulty.
DUring the past fiscal year, the Commission's staff conducted on-site inspecnons of the early warning and surveillance programs of the CBOE, Boston
Stock
Exchange,
Midwest
Stock
Exchange, and PBW Stock Exchange; it
completed
on-site
inspections
of the
Amex, the NYSE and the Pacific Stock
Exchange in the previous fiscal year. In
addition, the Commission's staff reviewed
the programs of the NASD, as Implemented by ItS district offices located in
Philadelphia,
Cleveland,
New
York,
Chicago, San Francrsco and Atlanta.

The various self-regulatory
orqaruzations have primary responsibility
for examining their members with respect to
compliance with the applicable financial
responsibility rules. With respect to firms
not belonging
to any self-regulatory
organization
(SECO firms), the regional
office having JUrisdiction IS responsible in
the first instance for compliance monitorIng The responsibilities
of a principal
examining authonty, and of the Commission's regional offices In the case of
SECO firms, Involve routine examinations
of the broker-dealers or when necessary.
The regional offices, In addition, conduct
of member firms
oversight examlnatrons
In furtherance of the Commission's early
warning and surveillance efforts.
The Commission's program for exarmnIng the self-regulatory
organizations has
two phases Through the first phase, onsite Inspections
of the self-regulatory
orqaruzatrons,
the Commission's
staff
reviews
and attempts
to strengthen,
where necessary, their exarrunatron, early
warning, surveillance
and training programs, while at the same time evaluating
and defining the goals, pollcies, procedures, design, budget and staffing of
those programs.
DUring the past two
fiscal years, the staff has conducted
Inspections
of all eight
major
selfregulatory organizations and, dunnq the
past fiscal year, 13 out of the 14 district
offices of the NASD In order to evaluate
and, where appropriate,
to recommend
Improvements in the scope and desrqn of
each of those programs.
While It IS Important for the Commission to review at a national level the
system and desiqn of the examination
programs of the self-regulatory orgamzanons and to recommend that those programs be strengthened where appropriate,
the second phase of the Commission's
examination program, the direct examination of the members of the self-regulatory
organization, IS the entreat element of the
examination
program. Among other reasons, the proximity of the Cornrnisston'a
regional offices to the members being
examined puts them In the best position
to judge the effectiveness
of the selfregulators' examination programs and to

ascertain whether the stated pohcres and
procedures of the national offices of the
self-regulatory
organizations
are being
Implemented. The regional offices' overSight programs Involve (1) examinations
of member firms to determine whether
such firms are In compliance
With the
federal securities laws, and (2) concurrent reviews of the reports and working
papers of the latest examinations
performed
by the various self-regulatory
organizations of their members to determine whether
the self-regulators'
examination
programs are thorough
and
effective.
In addition to oversight exarmnattons,
the Commission's
regIonal offices conduct cause
examinatrons
and SECO
examinations.
Cause examinations
usually result from a complaint received by a
customer or another broker-dealer
and
are usually limited to the SUbject matter
of the complaint.
The examiner
may,
however, enlarge the scope of the examination If he believes that the firm's
operations warrant further study
The regional offices have established a
regular examination cycle In wtuch each
SECO broker-dealer
IS examined 30 to
60 days after It becomes registered With
the Commission and on an annual basis
thereafter. Such examinations are usually
routine examinations covering all aspects
of a broker-dealer's
operations.
Other
exarnrnatron goals of the regional offices
are to conduct oversight examinations of
at least five percent of the members of
each self-regulatory
orqaruzatron
in their
region.
The Oornmrssron headquarters rnorutors
the examination activities of the regional
offices, meeting With the regional office
examiners on a quarterly baSIS to review
the effectrveness of the examination program.
Of great assistance to the self-regulatory
organizations, and to the Oornmrsston In
the case of firms which are members of
more than one such organization,
has
been the designation, formerly made by
SIPC, but now made by the Oommrssron
as a result of amendments to Section 9(c)
of the SIPC Act effected by the 1975
Amendments, of one regulatory orqarnza81

tion In each case to serve as that firm's
pnncrpat
examining authonty for compliance with the financial responsibility
rules
Another step toward eliminating duplication of effort has been the Commission's
development
of
a
monthly
exammation
report which It transmits
both to ItS regional offices and to any
self-regulatory
organization
which
requests It The report IS a cornpuation of
all examinations
of all broker-dealers
conducted
dunng the previous twelve
months by either a regional office of the
Commission or a self-regulatory organization. This report has aided the regional
offices and the self-regulatory
orqarnzanons In avoiding duplicative
examinations.
In fiscal year 1975, the Commission's
regional offices conducted
a total of
1,071 broker-dealer exarmnanons, which
exceeded by 14% the year's total examination goal of 942. Of the 1,071 examinations
conducted, 449 were oversight examinations, 426 were cause examinations and
196 were routine examinations (mostly of
SECO f1rms).36
In early 1972, the Commission developed a revised and expanded brokerdealer
exarrnnatron
report
form
and
outlined the appropriate
report procedures to be undertaken by an examiner
In the conduct of his duties. These procedures were revised a number of times
and have been updated In order to reflect
the current rules and regulations applicable to broker-dealers. A special procedure
outline was prepared for firms which
engage In specialized types of business
In addition to those covered under the
general procedural outline.
A manual of instruction which amplifies
compliance
the outline for the secuntres
examiner In connection with the conduct
of an examination of a broker-dealer was
greatly expanded and Improved In 1972
and again In 1974 and 1975. In addition,
the self-regulatory
organizations
have
been requested
to formulate,
update
and/or
revise
appropnate
procedural
outlines for use by their employees engaged In the exarninanon of member
firms The Commission's staff has also
82

requested that examination manuals and
other instructional matenals be prepared
by each self-regulatory organization
The Commission's staff prepares and
transmits to the regional offices a monthly
status report of current
broker-dealer
regulatory developments to Insure greater
control over and more timely coordrnanon with the Commission's exarrunation
program. In addition, quarterly meetings
are held with the regional office employees
who are responsible
for each office's
examination programs for the purpose of
msunnq greater cooperation and control
over the Commission's
regulatory program.

Training Program
The Commission believes very strongly
In the need for comprehensive training
programs for secuntres
compliance examiners, both those on the Commission
staff and those on the staffs of the vanous
self-regulatory organizations. Such trainIng efforts, by continually updating the
skills and knowledge of the examiners,
contnbute substantially to the effectiveness and efficiency of the examination
programs conducted by the Oommlssion
and the self-regulatory
organizations.
Accordingly, the Commission has utilized
In the past fiscal year a senes of training
courses, some directed toward only Commission examiners
and others toward
both Commission examiners and the selfregulatory organizations' examiners. The
training
program
IS divided
Into two
categones training provided by outside
institutions
and training
provided
by
Internal SEC programs.
The Commission encouraged ItS own
securities compliance examiners to improve their skills through correspondence
courses, seminars and/or college courses
and has paid tumon for such study, where
appropnate. The Commission has also
instituted a program whereby examiners
are encouraged
to take a self-taught
training course prepared by an outside
agency and has provided each examiner
with the course materials. Furthermore,
the Commission IS presently assisting in
the development of a course specifically

designed to provide examiners with the
skills necessary to examine a firm having
computerized books and records.
The internal SEC training program for
securities compliance examiners consists
of four parts:
1 Periodic, two-day training seminars
In the regional offices on the subject of
Oomrntssron's
oversight
examinations
to which the self-regulators
are invited.
Such seminars review the results of
oversight
examinations,
diSCUSS any
new and Important
developments
or
techniques
With regard to these examinations, and provide an opportunity
for the regional offices to discuss With
the self-regulators
ways in which they
can further the principles and effectiveness of cooperative regulation.
2. Two-day seminars held twice each
year In each regional office for experienced securities compliance examiners
of exarrunatron
techon the subject
niques. Such seminars are not only
refresher courses, but also focus on
Significant
new
developments
and
serious recent problems in the Industry
and the particular
examination
techniques that might be used to deal With
such developments or problems.
3. Two four-day
training
seminars
held at the Commission's headquarters.
These seminars
increasingly
employ
audio-visual
Instruction
and provide
the
examiners from the Cornmissron,
self-regulatory
organizations
and state
securities
commissions
With information on the baSIC examination
techniques and the various rules, reputatrons
and regulatory programs of the Comrrussron which pertain to broker-dealer
tmancral and operational compliance.
4. Regional
office
continuing
examiner training program Involving biweekly, one-hour training sessions In
the regional
offices
These sessions
focus on new developments, problems,
rules
and
examination
techniques
Within the regional offices on an informal, continuing baSIS.
To insure a coordinated training effort,
the Commission has adopted a program
In which the regional office chief examiners meet every three months to diSCUSS

new training
techniques,
areas where
additional
training is required, and the
strengths and weaknesses of the current
program.
In addrtion to incorporating
the selfregulators'
examiners into the Commission's training programs, the Commission
has also emphasized the need for the
self-regulators
to Improve their own trainIng programs.
Consequently,
the Commissron periodically
reviews the training
efforts of the self-regulators
and has encouraged
each self-regulator
to hold
Informal,
bi-monthly
training
programs
and more formal annual training sessions.

Regulation of Broker-Dealer
Trading in Gold
As of December 31, 1974, the federal
restrictions
upon the ownership of gold
bullion by United States Citizens were
eliminated
It was apparent that some
broker-dealers
were planning to engage
In transactions Involving gold bullion and
that such activity might present many new
problems.
The Commission
Issued a
release calling some of them to the attention of broker-dealers
and Investors and
suggesting
several gUidelines
for purchasing
or investing
In gold 37 The
Oommissron
emphasized
the extreme
Importance of exercrsinq caution In such
dealings and of becoming entirely familiar
With the business reputation
and credentials of those seiling gold.
The Commission was concerned that a
number of broker-dealers
might partrcipate in a variety of marketing arrangements for Interests
In gold requrrinq
registration
under the Securities Act of
1933 Without such broker-dealers
realizIng this. In view of the uncertainty as to
the market for gold which would evolve
and of the risks Inherent In purcnasmq
gold, the Commission proposed to adopt
Securities
Exchange
Act Rule 15c3-5
designed to assure that broker-dealers
transactrons
for the acwho effected
counts of customers would not undertake
risks when settling
Imprudent tmancral
such traneacnons.w In addition, proposed
Rule 15c3-5
would
establish
certain
minimum
standards
for broker-dealers
83

with respect to the custody and safekeeping of gold held for customers. The
Commission's
concern
was based, In
part, on the substantial volatility of the
price of gold.
The Commission considered It Important, moreover, for each self-regulatory
organization to be certain that member
firms were familiar with the applicable
financial responsibility rules and regulations, including
the recently proposed
Rule 15c3-5, pertaining to transactions
in gold In that connection, the Commission thought it useful to review the regulatory program of each of the self-regulators
In order to Insure a coordinated
and
effective program of industry-wide regulation for broker-dealers engaging In transactions
In gold for the accounts
of
customers. Accordingly, the staff held a
meeting with representatives from seven
national securities exchanges, the NASD
and SIPC on January 21, 1975. The meetIng considered such Issues as the Commission's approach to certain Interests In
gold involving securities,
its views on
financial responsibility rules and regulations pertaining to transactions
In gold
(Including
the proposed Rule 15c3-5),
sustabihty
standards
and
appropriate
procedures for supervrsron of sales practices, and examination and surveillance

In much the same way, the Oomrmssion
has coordinated the efforts of ItS regional
offices In surveying SECD broker-dealers
with regard to their mtentrons to trade In
gold and In developing a program for the
examination
and surveillance
of such
firms That program Involved the development of a specral exarrunauon checklist

for SECD broker-dealers trading in gold.
Finally, the Oornrmssron
has coordinated
many of ItS efforts In this area with the
bank regulatory agencies.

Regulatory Burdens on the Small
Broker-Dealer
The Oornmtssron
has analyzed the effects Its rules and regulatIOns are having
on the viability
of small brokers and
dealers and IS aware of the need to
Identify and eliminate any unnecessary
reporting or regulatory burdens upon the
small broker-dealer
firm, without compromising
any needed protections
afforded the public. In that connection, and
In order to help to assure the continued
participation of small brokers and dealers
In the United States securities markets,
the Commission has addressed itself to
the problems of the small broker-dealer.
continued
Beyond the Comrnissron's
review of ItS tmancial and operational
responsibility
rules, perhaps the most
VISible demonstration of the Oomrnlssron's
concern for eliminating
unnecessary or
duplicative reporting burdens, particularly
for small broker-dealers,
has been its
active participation
in the work of the
Report Coordinating Group. That group's
progress is summarized in Part 1 of trus
report.
Oonstderatron
of the regulatory burden
on the small broker-dealer has generally
been part of a broader regulatory effort
by the Commission and the self-regulatory
organizations
to eliminate
duplicative,
unnecessary
and unduly
burdensome
elements. Actions already taken by the
Commission in this area Include:
1. ReView of the Commission's tmancral
and
operational
responsibility
rules, all other rules and requlatrorrs,
and related reporting requirements for
broker-dealers;
2. Forrnatron of the SEC Advrsory
Committee on Broker-Dealer
Reports
and RegistratIOn ReqUirements-Report
Coordinating Group (Advisory);
3. Formation of the SEC BrokerDealer
Model
Compliance
Program
Advisory Committee;

4. Formation of the SEC Advisory
Committee on the Implementation
of a
Central Market System; and
5. Consideration
of additional securities legislation.

CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT
A number of clearing
entities 39 and
depositories 40 affiliated
with
national
securities
exchanges or the NASD are
currently In operation. During fiscal year
1975, numerous changes and additions to
the rules and practices of these clearing
and depository
entities were submitted
to the Commission for review and consideration under various provrsrons of the
Act. The following are among the Significant Items on which the Commission
acted favorably:
1. Pursuant to Securities Exchange
Act Rule 9b-1, the Amex and the CBOE
proposed
the establishment
of the
Options Clearing
Corporation,
which
was Intended to act as a single clearing
and settlement entity for transactions
in exchange-traded
options. The submission by the two exchanges was the
result of Commission urging that they
direct their efforts toward the establishment of a central option market system,
for which common clearing facility was
one of the essential elements,
2. The NYSE proposed that its wholly
owned subsidiaries, the Stock Clearing
Corporation ("SCC") and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC"), establish and
operate a Continuous
Net Settlement
("CNS")
System. The CNS System
reduces, through netting, the number
of trades which a participant
In SCC
must
settle
and
makes
possrble,
through a link between SCC and DTC,
automatic
book
entry
settlements
through clearing participants' accounts
in DTC.
3. The Amex proposed that ItS whollyowned
subsidiary,
American
Stock
Exchange Clearing Corporation, establish a CNS System which IS comparable
to SCC's system and has a Similar link
with DTC

4. The Boston Stock Exchange, the
Midwest
Stock
Exchange,
Inc., the
PBW Stock Exchange, Inc and TAD
Depository
Corporation
("TAD")
proposed that TAD establish a transfer
agent depository as a tacrlrty of those
exchanges. As a transfer agent depository, TAD accepts from particrpatinq
broker-dealers
deposits of those securities for which the transfer agents have
entered Into an expediting relationship.
TAD holds the securities as a custodian
and, pursuant to withdrawal
instructions, re-dellvers the securities
to ItS
particrpants
or to customers
of ItS
partlcrpants
on an expedited
basts.
TAD's services Include divrdend protecnon and proxy handling with respect
to securities held In custody.
5. Followrnq favorable action by the
Commission with respect to the TAD
transfer agent depository, TAD and the
National Clearing Corporation ("NCC"),
a wholly-owned subsrdrary of the NASD,
proposed to establish an Interface between TAD and NCC. As proposed, the
interface would enable broker-dealer
participants in either or both TAD and
NCC to effect delivery of securities to
other broker-dealers In TAD or NCC by
bookkeeping entry.
6. The NCC proposed to establish a
National Envelope Settlement System
("NESS"). NESS would expand NCC's
extstrnq Envelope Settlement
System
In New York to provide for inter-city
deliveries of securities and settlement
of trades not qualified for clearance
and settlement
through
NCC's CNS
system NCC's goal was to lower the
cost of inter-city
settlements
to ItS
participants through the use of NCC's
existrnq network of regional
service
centers, comrnumcatrons and couriers.
In reviewmq these matters, the Commission acted with a view toward tacuuatIng the development of a national system
for the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of sscunnes transactions,
including the elimination
of the use of
secunues certificates
by broker-dealers
In connection
With the settlement
of
secuntres transactions.

SECURITIES INVESTOR
PROTECTION CORPORATION
SIPC was established to provide certain protections to customers of SIPC
members. It IS a non-profit membership
corporation, the members of which are
registered brokers and dealers and members of national secuntres exchanges
While SIPC IS funded prrmarrly through
assessments
on ItS members,
under
certain conditions It may borrow up to $1
brllron from the Unrted States Treasury
Durrng the summer of 1974, a Special
Task Force organized by the Chairman
of SIPC made ItS report and recommendations for changes In the SIPC Act to the
SIPC Board of Directors 41 DUring fiscal
year 1975, the SIPC Board approved
essentially all of the report and In late
1974 presented It to Congress. The legislative proposal was Introduced Into both
Houses of Congress In late 197442 and
was reintroduced
In the first half of
of
1975.43 The major recommendations
that proposal are: (1) to amend exrstrnq
procedures which require court-appointed
trustees in all SIPC lrqurdatrons to permit
SIPC to make direct payments to customers In small cases, (2) to permit customer accounts to be transferred In bulk
to other brokers In appropriate
cases
rather than to be hquidated account by
account, and (3) to raise the dollar limits
of protection to correspond to the limits
of protection afforded depositors by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Litigation Related to SIPC
In SEC v. Guaranty Bond and Securtthe United States Court of
ties Corp.,H
Appeals for the Sixth Orrcuit held, among
other things, that the receiver of a brokerdealer appointed by the district court had
standing to bring an action on behalf of
customers of the broker-dealer to compel
SIPC to initiate Ilqurdatron proceedings
under the SIPC Act. In response to SIPC's
petition,
which
the Commission
supported,» the Supreme Court agreed to
On May 19, 1975,
review this decisron
the Supreme Court reversed the decrsron
of the Sixth Crrcurt and held that the
86

Cornrrnssron's statutory right to brrng an
action to require SIPC to discharge its
duties IS exclusive and that customers
have no similar Implied right of actlon.w
That decision affirms the Oomrmssron's
position that only It may seek judrcral
review of a discretionary
determination
by SIPC not to initiate proceedings.

Commission Rule Changes
Relating to SIPC
On October 8, 1974, the Commission
announced the adoption of Securities
Exchange Act Rule 15b5-1 and the
amendments of Securities Exchange Act
Rule 15b6-1 and related Form BDW.47
The rules and forms provided that where
the Commission revokes or cancels the
registration
of a broker-dealer,
or a
broker-dealer withdraws ItS registration,
the effectiveness
of such revocation,
cancellatron,
or withdrawal
would
be
delayed for six months for purposes of
the SIPC Act. Thus, during that period,
the protection of the SIPC Act would be
available to the customers of the brokerdealer whose claims arose prior to the
effective date of revocation, cancellation,
or withdrawal

SECO BROKER-DEALERS
Under the Securities Exchange Act, the
Commission IS responsible for establishIng and adrmnlstennq rules on qualification standards and business conduct of
broker-dealers who are not members of
the NASD (referred to as SECD brokerdealers) in order to provide regulation of
such broker-dealers comparable to that
provided by the NASD for ItS members.
At the close of the fiscal year, the number of nonmember broker-dealers registered with the Cornmrssron totaled 302
and the number of associated persons of
such firms (i.e., partners, officers, directors and employees
not engaged In
merely clerical or rntrustertal functions)
totaled 21,122.
On May 1, 1975, the Oornrmssron announced adoption of Securities Exchange
Act Rule 15b10-11, which establishes
fidelity bonding requirements for SECO

broker-deaters.w A similar rule had been
adopted by the NASD, as described in
the Commission's 40th Annual Report.49
The primary purpose of the bonding rules
IS to prevent the unwarranted exposure
of SIPC funds to certain special kinds of
losses, such as misappropriation
of firm
assets through employee theft and dishonesty.
Securities Exchange Act Rule 15b1()-11
requires that SECO broker-dealers
carry
a fidelity bond In the form, amount and
type of coverage prescribed by the Rule.
The bond IS required to contain agreements covering
at least the tollowrnq
areas:
1 A "Fidelity"
insuring clause to
Indemnify
the Insured
broker-dealer
against loss of property through any
dishonest
or fraudulent
acts of employees (this clause
also generally
covers
losses
due
to "Fraudulent
Trading" by employees);
2. An "On
Premises"
agreement
Insuring against losses resulting from
common law and statutory crimes such
as burglary and theft and Including a
"Misplacement"
clause
specifically
covering misplacement
and "mysterious, unexplainable disappearances"
of
property
of the insured (no matter
where located),
3. An "In Transit" clause indemnifying against
losses occurring
while
property IS In transit,
4. A "Forgery and Alteratron" agreement insuring against loss due to forgery or alteration of various kinds of
negotiable
Instruments
(including
checks); and
5. A "Securities
Loss" clause protecting
the insured
against
losses
incurred through forgery and atteration
of secuntres,
or written
documents
relating
to securities,
ownership,
or
conveyance.
In addition,
Rule 15b1 ()-11 requires
SECO broker-dealers
to obtain certain
minimum coverages similar to the coverages set forth In the NASD's bonding
rule
Securities Exchange Act Rule 15b9-2

Imposes an annual assessment to be paid
by SECO broker-dealers
to defray the
cost of their regulation by the Commission. During the fiscal year, the Commission increased the fee for each associated
person of a SECO member from $12 to
the Form SECC-2
$15.50 Additionally,
filing fee Imposed pursuant to Securities
Exchange Act Rule 15b9-1 , was Increased
from $35 to $50. These Increases were
made necessary by Increased costs of
the SECO program.

EXEMPTIONS
DUring fiscal year 1975, the Commission or ItS staff, acting pursuant to delegated authority,
granted the toltowmq
exemptions
to statutory
provrsrons or
rules adopted under the Securities Exchange Act.
1. Of 487 requests for exemption
under paragraph (f) of Securrtles Exchange Act Rule 10b-6,
347 were
granted because the transactions
did
not constitute a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance
within the
meaning of the rule. Rule 10b-6 places
certain
prohibitions
upon trading
In
secunties by persons Interested In a
distribution of such securities.
2. One request for an exemption
from
the
broker-dealer
registration
requirements was received and granted
pursuant to Section 15(a)(2) as necessary and appropriate
In the public
Interest
and for the protection
of
Investors 51
3. Ten requests for exemptions under
Rule 17a-20 were received
by the

OTHER COMMISSION RULE
CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS
Mortgage Market Exemptions
As previously reported,52 the Oomrrussion had been working with the Federal
Home
Loan
Mortgage
Corporation
(FHLMC) to clarify the applicability
of
the federal secuntres laws to Arnrrunet,
Inc., which was established under FHLMC
sponsorship
to operate an automated
trading Information
system to promote
a more liquid
secondary
market for
residential mortgages. FHLMC and the
Commission developed proposed leqislanon on that subject, which resulted In
the 1975 Amendments adding an exemption for certain mortgage-related
securities to Section 4(5) of the Securities Act
of 1933.
Under the new exemption. transactions
involving (I) offers or sales of certain
mortgage-related
securities, or (ii) nonassignable contracts to buy or sell such
secuntres which are to be completed
within two years may be conducted, under
the conditions
and manner specrned,
without compliance with the registration
and prospectus requirements of Section 5
of the secunnes Act The exemption IS
available only with respect to promissory
notes directly secured by a first mortgage
on a single parcel of real estate upon
which IS located a residential or comrnercrat
structure,
and
participation
Interests In such notes For offers or sales
securmes
to
of such mortgage-related
qualify for the exemptions, three conditions of sale must be satisfied: the minimum aggregate sales price per purchaser
must be not less than $250,000, the
purchaser must pay cash either at the
time of sale or within sixty days thereof,
and each purchaser must buy for hrs own
account. Furthermore, for the transaction
to qualify for the exemption, only desiqnated types of institutions may originate
the mortgage-related
secuntres, and In
certain Instances, only designated rnstrtunons may purchase
such securities
Finally, the exemption does not apply to
resales of secuntres acquired pursuant to
that exemption unless each of the conditions of sale IS satisfied.

Regulatory Problems Posed by
"Going Private"
On February 6, 1975, the Commission
announced that It was ordering a public
investigatory and rulemaking proceeding
relating
to so-called
"going
private"
transactions by public companies or their
afflliates.53 The Commission mvited both
oral and written comments from interested persons regarding
rules It was
proposing and various specific inquiries
related to such transactions.
The Oornmlssion noted that the two
rules it was proposing were desrqned to
provide an opportunity
for public comment, but that It had not at that time
with respect to
reached any conclustons
the proposed rules. The Oomrmssrcn also
noted that the announced proceeding and
proposed rules should not in any way be
owned
subsidiary,
American
Stock
Exchange Clearing Corporation,
estabto such transactions.
The first of the two proposed rules
(Securities Exchange Act Rule 13e-3(A)
was designed to protect Investors, particularly the Interests of minority security
holders, In "going private" transactions.
The Rule would make unlawful certain
purchases of an Issuer's securities, and
certain related solicitations of proxies, by
the Issuer or ItS affiliates, as defined, unless the Issuer or its affiliate compiled
With specmc disclosure and substantive

provlsrons
As an alternative to certain of the provrsrons of proposed Rule 13e-3(A), the
Commission at the same time also published for comment proposed Rule 13e3(8). That Rule would require that, when
the purchase of an equity security by the
Issuer or an affiliate would result or was
Intended to result In any of the enumerated consequences, terms of the transaction, including any consrderanon to be
paid to any secunty holder, be fair and, In
transactions by the Issuer, that a valid
busmess purpose
for the transaction
exist
Proposed RuIe 13&-3(8),
which
would also Include some or all of the
disclosure and tender offer requirements
set forth In proposed Rule 13e-3(A), was
Intended to provide the Commission With

sufficient flexibility to deal with any type
of transaction by an issuer or its affiliates
having the same consequences
The Commission received a substantial
number of written comments, which are
being reviewed and analyzed. The Commission noted that, after the proceeding,
it might adopt or propose for comment
one or more rules under the Securities
Exchange Act and/or recommend legislation to the Congress.

Foreign Access to United States
Securities Markets
On February 8, 1974, the Commission
solicited public comment on Issues affecting foreign professional access to the
United States securities markets. 54 The
Commission received a number of comments, which are being studied by the
staff together with the provisions of the
1975 Amendments as they may relate to
the issue of foreign access. The Commission expects to complete its study of this
matter In the near future.

Real Estate Investment Contract
Securities
On January 31, 1975, the Commission
adopted Rule 3a12-5 and amendments to
Rule 15c2-5,55 which served to exempt
certain
investment
contract
secunnes
involVing the direct ownership of specified
resrdennal
real property from the Exchange Act's credit arrangement provisions when offered by broker-dealers,
subject to certain conditions. The Commission stated that the unique characteristics
of lhese investment contract
securities
make the existence of the
concerns about credit arrangements In
Sections 7(c) and 11(d)(1) of the Exchange Act unlikely. The Commission
considered
the lack of a secondary
trading market a significant
factor In
support of the proposed exemption.

Confirmation Requirements for
Periodic Transactions
On September 24, 1974, the Cornrrussion adopted an amendment to Rule

15c1-4 under the Exchange Act relating
to purchases of redeemable securities
issued by registered
Investment companies and unit Investment trusts.56 The
Commission had published notice of a
proposal to adopt these amendments on
March 15, 1974.57
Before the adoption of the amendment,
Rule 15c1-4 required brokers and dealers
to give or send to their customers wntten
confirmations
of securities transactions
effected with or for the account of such
customers at or before the completion of
each such transaction. Representatives of
the mutual fund Industry sought the
amendment to make It more economical
for registered open-end investment companies to sell shares to participants In
group plans and tax qualified pension
plans which might Involve small and
frequent purchases. They noted that the
need for tms amendment was especially
Important in view of the recently enacted
Employee Retirement
Income Security
Act of 1974,58 which permits the use of
mutual funds as investment media for
certain tax qualified individual and group
pension plans.
The amendments relaxed the requirements of Rule 15c1-4 with respect to
certain purchases of shares of open-end
investment companies and unit investment trusts by permitting a broker-dealer
to confirm on a quarterly basis, rather
than Immediately, purchases of securities
of such Issuers pursuant to (a) mdrvrduat
retirement or pension plans under the
Internal Revenue Code, or (b) group plans
whether or not qualified under the IRC.
The Commission did not relax the confirmation requirements for purchases of
equity securities made pursuant to certain
systematic
accumulation
plans
administered
by
broker-dealers.
The
Oornrnissron
indicated that the various
policy issues and technical
problems
relating to a further relaxation of Rule
15c1-4 In this area would continue to
receive staff study.

Short Selling into Secondary
Offerings
On April 2, 1975, the Commission

pub89

"shed for comment revrstons of proposed
Rules 10l:r-20 and 10l:r-21 under the Exchange Act and proposed amendments
to Rules 17a-3(a)(6) and 17a-3(a)(7). ';9
Those rules were first proposed on February 11, 1974,&11and relate to certain
practices
which were brought
to the
Commission's intention, partly as a result
by the Commission's
of an mvestrqatron
staff 61
Proposed Rule 10l:r-20 would prohibit
underwriters and dealers participating
In
a secunties distribution from requiring a
purchaser, In order to receive an allocation of secuntres from the underwriter or
dealer, to pay consrderatron
In addition
to the amount indicated In the prospectus
or to perform any other act such as
purcnasmq an additional security In an
unrelated
offering
(so-called
"tie-in"
arrangements).
Proposed
Rule 10l:r-21
would Impose certain limitations on purchases to cover short sales where such
short sales were effected
before the
commencement
of an offering mvolvmq
securities of the same class.
Under the proposed amendments to
Rule 17a-3,
broker-dealers
would
be
required to ask customers, or note If the
sale was for the broker-dealer's
own
account, whether the sale was "long" or
"short"
These record keeping changes
are Intended to assist broker-dealers
In
relating
to

With provrsrons
short sales under the secunnes laws, and
most notably Regulalion T (broker-dealer

by the

ENFORCEMENT

The Commission's enforcement actrvrties, which are designed to combat securities fraud and other Illegal activities,
continued. at a high level durrnq the past
year These activities
encompass CIVil
and criminal court actions, as well as
administrative
proceedings
conducted
Internally. Where violations of the securities laws are established, the sanctions
which may result range from censure by
the Comrnisston
to prison sentences
Imposed by a court.
The enforcement program is designed
to achieve as broad a regulatory Impact
as possible within the framework of resources available to the Cornrnrssron. In
light of the capability of self-regulatory
and state and local agencies to deal
effectively with certain securities violations, the Commission seeks to promote
effective coordination
and cooperation
between its own enforcement activities
and those of other agencies

and answered. Most of the above mentioned complaints dealt With operational
problems, such as the failure to deliver
securities
or funds promptly,
or the
alleged mishandling of accounts. In addition, there were some 5,500 complaints
received concerning Investment advisers,
issuers,
banks,
transfer
agents
and
mutual funds.
seeks to assist perThe Comrnlssron
sons In resolving complaints and to furnish requested information. Thousands of
Investor complaints are resolved through
staff inquiries of the firms Involved. While
the Comrrussron does not have authority
to arbitrate
private disputes
between
brokerage firms and investors or directly
to assist Investors In the legal assertion
of their personal rights, a complaint may
lead to the mstitutron of an investigation
or an enforcement proceeding, or It may
be referred to a self-regulatory or local
enforcement agency.

DETECTION

Market Surveillance

Complaints

To enable the Commission to carry out
surveillance of the securities markets, Its
staff has devised procedures to identify
possible violative
activities.
These include surveillance
of listed secuntres,
which is coordinated
With the market
surveillance operations of the New York,
American and regional stock exchanges.

as complaints

For those secuntres
of the NASDAQ system, the Commission
has also developed a surveillance
program, which
IS coordinated
with the
NASD's market surveillance staff, through
a review of weekly and special stock
watch reports.
For those over-the-counter
secuntres
not traded through NASDAQ, the Commission uses automated equipment
to
provide an efficient and comprehensive
surveillance

with other available information, is analyzed for possrbte
further mquiry and
enforcement action.
In addition, recognizing that the computer
provides
the most expeditious
method of reviewing and analyzing the
volurnmous trading data generated by the
secunties markets, the Commission has
developed a program which provides an
analysrs of the bid listings for each secunty by surnrnanzmq specified
types of
activity by each broker-dealer
firm submitting pnce quotations for that particular
secunty.
The staff oversees tender offers, exchange offers, proxy contests and other

INVESTIGATIONS
Each of the acts administered by the
by
Commission authorizes investigations
It to determine If violations have occurred.
Most of these are conducted
by the
Commission's regional offices. Investigations are earned out on a confidential
baSIS, consistent with effective law enforcement and the need to protect persons against whom unfounded charges
or
might be made. Thus, the exrstence
results of a nonpublrc investigation
are
generally not divulged unless they are
made a matter of public record In proceedings brought before the Commission
or In the courts. Dunng fiscal year 1975,
a total of 490 investigations were opened,
as against 382 In the preceding year.

LITIGATION INVOLVING
COMMISSION INVESTIGATIONS
In White v. Jeeqermen,' the plaintiffs
had filed SUit against the Commission's
Chief Investigative Counsel, seven other
present or former Commission employees
and others alleging that the Chief Investiharassed

the Commission
to suspend over-thecounter trading of the stock of the corporate plaintiff,
and to cause another

Judge McLean dismissed
the

complaint against each of the former and
present Commission employees, with the
exception
of the Chief
Investigative
Counsel, on the ground that the activities
alleged In the complaint were within the
scope of their official duties and they
therefore
were Immune from SUIt. In
Judge McLean's View, however, the alleged leaking by the Chief Investigative
Counsel of Information obtained by him
during a confidential investigation, which
Information
the plaintiffs
alleged was
false, would have been outside the scope
of his employment. Judge McLean indicated that the plaintiffs should have the
opportunity to present proof as to these
allegations
and that
their
complaint
should not be disposed of by motion for
summary JUdgment.
On October 2 and 3, 1974, the case
was tried before Judge Bonsai sitting
without
a Jury. After the trial, Judge
Bonsai dismissed the complaint against
the Chief Investigative Counsel, who was
the only remaining
defendant,
on the
ground that the plaintiffs had failed to
prove that he acted outside the scope of
his employment or that he intimidated
them or otherwise engaged in Improper
conduct. In order to sustain their claims
against the Chief Investigative Counsel,
the court held that the plaintiffs had to
show "that he acted outside the limits of
the broad investigative
responsibilities
with which he was charged." 2
Furthermore, the court held that the
plaintiffs would not be entitled to damages In any event Since, among other
things, the truth of the information published In the New York Times had been
established In the Commission's
injunctive action against the plalntlfts."
S.E.C. v. Csapo 4 involves the application of the Commission's
sequestration
rule in a non public investigation.
The
district court conditioned the enforcement
Investigative subpoena
of a Oornmisston
directed to Mr. Csapo upon his being
permitted to be accompanied
and represented by certain attorneys who also
represented
various other persons involved In the investigation. The Commission appealed from the portion of the
enforcement order Imposing this condi-

tion, and the matter IS pending In the
court of appeals.
In S.E.C. v. Republic
National
Life
Insurance Co., et al.,5 one of the defendants, Peat, Marwrck, Mitchell and Co.
filed a counterclaim against the Commission seeking, In effect, an order requiring
the Commission,
whenever It uncovers
information that might be material to an
Independent public accountant's
examination of financial statements that are to
be filed With the Commission, to disclose
that information
to the accountant. On
October 18, 1974, the district court dismissed the counterclaim
finding that It
was Within the Commission's
discretion
to deny Peat Marwlck access to investigative materials and that the exercise of
discretion was not reviewable.

ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has available a Wide
range of possible enforcement remedies.
It may, In appropriate
cases, refer ItS
files to the Department of Justice With a
recommendation
for criminal
prosecution. The penalties upon conviction are
specmed
in the various statutes and
Include
Imprisonment
for
substantial
terms as well as fines.
The securities laws also authorize the
Comrmssron to file injunctive actions In
the Federal district courts to enjoin continued or threatened violations of those
laws or applicable Oomrrusston rules. In
injunctive
actions the Commission
has
frequently
sought
to obtain
ancillary
relief under the general equity powers of
the Federal district courts. The power of
the Federal courts to grant such rehef
recognized.
The
has been judrctally
Commission
has often requested
the
court to appoint a receiver for a brokerdealer or other business where Investors
were likely to be harmed by continuance
of the existing management. It has also
requested,
among other things, court
orders restricting future activities of the
defendants, requiring that rescissron be
offered to secunnes purchasers, or reqUiring disgorgement of the defendants'
III-gotten gains.
The SEC's primary function IS to pro97

tect the public from fraudulent and other
unlawful
practices
and not to obtain
damages for Injured individuals. Thus, a
request that drsqorqernent be required IS
predicated on the need to deprive defendants of profits derived from their unlawful conduct and to protect the public by
deterring such conduct by others.
If the terms of any injunctive decree
are violated, the Commission
may file
criminal
contempt
proceedings,
as a
result of which the violator may be fined
or imprisoned
The Federal securities acts also authorize the Commission to Impose remedial
administrative
sanctions.
Most
commonly, administrative
enforcement
proceedings Involve alleged violations of the
securities acts or regulations by firms or
persons engaged In the secuntres business. Generally speaking, if the Cornrnrssion finds that a respondent
willfully
violated a provision of or rule under the
secuntres
acts, failed
reasonably
to
supervise another person who committed
a violation, or has been convicted for or
enjoined from certain types of misconduct, and that a sanction IS In the public
Interest, It may revoke or suspend the
registration of a broker-dealer or investment adviser, bar or suspend an mdrvidual from the secunnes business or from
associatron with an Investment company,
or censure a firm or individual. ProceedIngs may also cover adequacy of disclosure in a registration statement or In
reports filed with the Commission. Such
a case may lead to an order suspending
the effecllveness of a registration statement or directing compliance
with reporting requirements
The Commission
also has the power summarily to suspend
trading In a security when the public
Interest requires.
Proceedings are frequently completed
without
hearings
where
respondents
waive their right to a hearing and submit
settlement offers consenting to remedial
action which the Commission accepts as
an appropriate
disposition
of the proceedings The Commission tries to gear
ItS sanctions In both contested and settlement cases to fit the circumstances of the
particular case. For example, It may limit
98

the sanction to a particular branch office
of a broker-dealer
rather than sanction
the entire firm, prohibit only certain kinds
of activity by the broker-dealer during a
period of suspension or only prohibit an
mdivrdual from engaging In supervisory
activities

ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS
Summarized below are some of the
many administrative proceedings pending
or disposed of In fiscal 1975.
Financial Programs, Inc.6-The
Commrssion instituted administrative proceedings against Financial Programs, Inc., a
Denver-based mutual fund manager and
five of ItS former officers. Pursuant to
offers of settlement submitted by Finanoral Programs and two of the Individual
respondents in which they neither admitted or denied the charges, the Comrnissron found that respondents violated
the antifraud provisions of the SeCUrities,
Securities
Exchange, Investment Company and Investment
Advisers
Acts.
Specifically, it was found that Financial
Programs and the two former officers
committed over $21 million of the assets
of the four funds, for which Financial
Programs served as investment adviser,
to several over-the-counter securities that
were speculative,
unseasoned
and in
limited supply. This was done on the
basis of recommendations
made by a
single salesman and Without adequate
Independent study.
The Commission found that the funds'
prospectuses and periodic reports disseminated to the public were false and
misleading because the stated investment
policies were disregarded. There was no
disclosure about the practices described
above or their effect on the net asset
values of the funds, or about the funds'
inability to dispose of these securities at
prices that their own trading had created.
The Commission also found that Financral Programs Violated certain provisions
of the Federal securities laws by causing

the funds It managed to maintain excessive cash balances with a certain bank
which
considered
those
balances
in
lending money to persons affiliated with
Financial Programs.
The Commission further found that the
two officers of Financial Programs referred to above received compensation
from the salesman who had arranged the
sales of the thinly traded over-the-counter
securities to the funds and that such
compensation was obtained In violation
of the Investment Company Act.
The Commission
ordered
Financial
Programs to comply with ItS undertaking
to, among other things, offer the four
funds $2.5 rmllron In settlement of claims
against It and refrain for 180 days from
performing
any
Investment
advisory
function for any new client. The Commission barred one of the former officers,
and barred
in certain
respects
and
suspended In other respects the other
former officer from engaging In certain
activities in the securities Industry,
In a subsequent order, the Commission
found, pursuant to an offer of settlement
submitted by Financial Programs's former
president, that he failed to adopt adequate supervisory
procedures,
misrepresented to shareholders that the funds
would be properly managed, and caused
the funds to maintain excessive cash
balances. He was suspended for a SO-day
period from engaging In certain activities
industry. The CommisIn the secuntres
sion noted his undertaking to pay $15,000
to two of the tunds.?
The proceedings against the two remaining respondents were stili pending
at the end of the fiscal year.
Chase Investment Services of Boston,
Inc.8.-The
Commission
simultaneously
instituted
administrative
proceedings
against Chase Investment Services of
Boston, Inc. (CIS), John P. Chase, Inc.
(JPC), CIS's parent, and certain lndividuals, and issued an order Imposing remedial sanctions against respondents, based
upon offers of settlement In which respondents, without admitting or denying
the charges against them, consented to
certain findings and sanctions. Pursuant
to these offers, the Commission found

that (a) CIS, certain officers of CIS and
JPC and others violated the antifraud
provrsrons
of the secunties
laws; and
(b) JPC and the chairman of JPC's board
of directors failed reasonably to supervise
with a view toward
preventing
such
violations.
The Oornrnlsston
found that advertisements were distributed
and oral sales
presentations made to CIS clients which
contained untrue and misleading statements relating to, among other things,
the similarity
between CIS's advisory
service to the kind of service furnished
by JPC and other Investment counsel
firms to wealthy Investors, the past performance of CIS accounts, and the risks
Involved In CIS's Investment methods.
The Commission also found that investment decisrons for CIS clients were made
without regard to their SUitability for the
particular client; clients accounts were
not promptly
reviewed when material
changes
occurred
in CIS's
research
in such acpositions about secuntres
counts;
Inducements
were offered to
broker-dealers to recommend that their
customers become clients of CIS, mcludIng a share of the advisory fees paid by
such clients and the likelihood of substantial brokerage Income; and that the
foregoing facts were not disclosed to
clients or prospective clients of CIS.
The Commission's
order:
(1) Suspended both CIS and JPC for 180 days
from solicrtrnq or accepting new clients
for or on behalf of CIS; (2) Required CIS
to serve ItS existlnq clients at cost during
the aforementioned
180-day suspension
period; (3) Suspended the chairman of
JPC's board of directors from assocration
with an Investment advrser for 30 days;
(4) Suspended the Investment adviser
registration
of JPC's former executive
vice-president and his right to associate
himself with any other Investment adviser
for 30 days; and (5) Precluded CIS's
former president from associating himself
with an investment adviser, a broker, or a
dealer without the Commission's
pnor
approval. The Commission's order noted
that CIS and JPC have undertaken to
institute certain remedial steps for the
conduct of CIS's advrsory business and
99

that JPC's former executive vice-president
has made a similar undertaking
with
respect
to
his
Investment
advisory
business
Intersearch
Technology,
Inc.-The
decrsion
of an administrative
law Judge
revoking the investment adviser registrations of Intersearch Technology, Inc, and
Intersearch Publications, Inc and barring
Jesse B. Reid, who controlled both firms,
from being associated with an Investment
adviser became the final decrsion of the
Commission
It was found that during 1970 and early
1971 respondents had violated the antiof the Investment Adfraud provrsrons
visers Act by uSing false and misleading
statements in subscriptions to the investment
advisory
publication
Interscan
and failing to disclose the firms' insolvency to subscnbers
or potential subscnbers to their publications.
Third National
Corporation 9-Admlnrstrative
proceedings
were
instituted
against Third National
Corporation,
a
registered
bank holding
company,
to
determine whether certain of ItS filings
with the Oornmrssson under the secunttes
Exchange Act were deficient. Third National consented, without admitting
or
denying the charges, to findings that ItS
filings were detrcient In several material
respects. The Commission ordered Third
National to correct ItS filings to disclose.
(1) that key management of Third National's pnncrpal Subsidiary, Third National Bank, had a significant undisclosed
Interest In certain acquisitions
effected
by Third National, and (2) that Third
National Bank, in connection with ItS coractrvmes,
had a
respondent
banking
practice of making loans to persons In
positrons of control or influence at correspondent banks, which loans were on
terms more favorable than those available to comparable borrowers not In a
position to Influence Third National Bank's
correspondents
As part of ItS settlement offer, Third
National undertook to Inform ItS shareholders fully of these matters and to offer
rescission to offerees of a current exchange offer.

100

Laidlaw & Co., Inc.-Public
administrative proceedings were ordered against 21
respondents based on charges of violations of various provrsrons of the Federal
securrties laws, primarily In connection
with an unsuccessful public offering of
200,000 shares of SaCom common stock
on October 31, 1972. Named as respondents were the managing underwriter,
Laidlaw & Co., Inc. (now known as LAC,
Inc.) and Rollin F. Perry, the former head
of Laidlaw's corporate finance drvrslon:
two market makers in SaCom stock, A.P.
Montgomery and Torpre & Saltzman, Inc.;
eight of the participating
underwriters
in the SaCom offering
and the legal
counsel for Laidlaw. The Commission
also named NDF Securities,
Inc. and
seven individuals
In connection
with
trading actrvmes in SaCom.
It was alleged that Laidlaw and Perry,
in the SaCom offering, engaged In manipulative activities to facilitate the distribution of the SaCom offering and create the
false rrnpressron
that the offering had
been successfully
distributed
to the
public. In thrs regard it was alleged that
members of the underwriting
syndicate
sent false "all-sold" wires to the manager
of the syndicate. It was further alleged
that there were undisclosed pre-effective
date arrangements between underwriters
whereby certain underwnters would not
have to accept unsold stock. Laidlaw,
Perry and others also were alleged to
have violated the Federal securities laws
In connection with trading activities
in
the common stock of Manchester Life &
Casualty Management Corp. and Dynalectron Corporation.
Nineteen
of the respondents
have
consented to the entry of various sanctions against them.1O A public hearing on
the charges against the two remaining
respondents
IS scheduled for October,
1975.
Steadman Security Corporation (SSC)Ttus IS an administrative
proceeding
against SSC, a registered
Investment
adviser, and Its president, board chairman, and controlling shareholder. He IS
also president and board chairman of
four registered
investment
companies

(Steadman Funds) managed by the registered Investment adviser. Also named
as respondents
were certain affiliated
registered broker-dealers.
An administrative law Judge found that
respondents committed violations of the
of the
antifraud
and other provisrons
federal
securities
laws.
Specifically,
respondents were found to have, among
other things, (a) caused the Steadman
Funds to maintain at or to transfer to
certain banks their custodian accounts
to enable respondents to get loans and
brokerage
commission
business
from
such banks instead of obtaining for the
Steadman Funds the best available custodian services at terms most advantageous
to such Funds, (b) caused
securities
transactions
between
the
Funds and an off-shore fund controlled
by respondents to be effected without
obtaining approval from the Commission
as required by the Investment Company
Act of 1940, (c) failed to see to It that the
funds filed reports required by the federal
securities laws on time and (d) failed to
disclose the above described conduct
The administrative
law jUdge concluded that the investment adviser registration of SSC should be revoked and its
president
be barred from association
with any investment
adviser or registered
investment
company
and suspended for one year from association
with any broker-dealer. At the end of the
fiscal year, the case was pending before
the Commission on review of the Initial
decision.
Samuel H. Sloan II-The
Commission
barred Samuel H. Sloan from association
with any broker-dealer
and revoked the
broker-dealer registration of his firm. The
Commission's
action
was
based
on
Sloan's persistent violations of the Exchange Act's recordkeeping,
net capital,
and on mjuncand reporting provrsrons
tive decrees restraining him from further
violations of the record keeping and net
capital provrsrons. The Commission concluded
that:
"Sloan's
Violations
are
neither tnvral nor technical. They Involve
flagrant and long-continued
breaches of

significant duties Imposed on persons In
the securities business."

APPLICATIONS FOR RELIEF
FROM DISQUALIFICATION
On February 26, 1975, the Commission
Issued a release announcing the various
factors which are considered
when it
entertains an application for readmission
to the securities business by mdlvrduais
or firms which previously
have been
In the securities
barred from partrcrpatron
business or some aspect thereof.12 The
Commission
noted that situations
may
exrst where, In view of changed circumstances and after the passage of a penod
of time, It may appear appropriate to the
Commission, In ItS discretion, to lift the
disqualification
If the applicant is able to
demonstrate to the Commission's
satisfaction that removal of the disqualification would be consistent With the public
Interest.
The Oommissron enumerated the following factors, among others, wrucn It
generally
considers
In exerclsinq
ItS
discretion In the review of applications
for relief: the period of time which has
elapsed since entry of the disqualification order, the nature of the findings that
resulted In the disqualification,
the applicant's
attempts to undo any Injury
resulting from his pnor misconduct, the
applicant's
overall
conduct
since the
entry of the disqualification
order, the
type and nature of the applicant's
prospective duties, and any other factors
which the Commission may deem pertinent. In addition, the Commission noted
rntorrnatron
that it may seek addrtronat
concerning the applicant by conducting
an mvesnqatron
or by obtaining the views
of Interested third parties.
As a final matter, the Commission
specrtied the procedures to be followed
by an applicant seeking relief from disqualitrcatron

TRADING SUSPENSIONS
The Securities
Exchange Act authorizes the Commission summarily to sus-

101

pend trading in a security traded on
either a national securities exchange or
In the over-the-counter
market for a
period of up to 10 days If, In the Commission's opinion, such action IS required In
the public Interest
DUring fiscal 1975, the Commission
suspended trading In the securities of 113
companies, a decrease of 59% from the
279 securities suspended In fiscal 1974
and a 35% decrease from the 174 securities suspended In fiscal 1973. The decreased number of trading suspensions
reflected a significant
reduction in the
number of issuers which were delinquent
In filing required reports with the Comrrussron. In most Instances, the suspensions were ordered either because of
substantial questions as to the adequacy,
accuracy or availability of public informalion concerning the companies' financial
condition or business operations or because of transactions in the companies'
secunties suggesting possible manipulation or other violations.
On January 3, 1975, the Commission
suspended trading In the securities of
American Agronomics Corporation 13 because of questions concerning the market
activity in the shares of the company.
On April 22, 1975, the Commission suspended trading In the securities of General Retractones Corporation 14 because
of the unavailability
of current accurate
Information concerning certain business
transactions conducted by the company
with a principal
European stockholder
and companies under his control, and
because of questions
concerning
the
Identity of that stockholder and the extent
of his holdings.

DEUNQUENTREPORTS
PROGRAM
Fundamental to the success of the disclosure scheme of the Federal securities
laws is the timely filing In proper form
and content of annual and other penodic
and current reports required to be filed
The Delinby Issuers and indivrduats
quent Reports Program IS designed to
Identify required reports which have not
been timely filed and, when appropriate,
102

to
recommend
remedial
enforcement
action Such enforcement action entails
alerting the public to the lack of current
and accurate
Information
and, where
necessary, seeking a court order requrrIng the filing of the delinquent reports
coupled with an injunction against further
violations of the Exchange Act's reporting
provisrons.
The statutory framework within which
thrs program operates IS primarily Secnons 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules thereunder which requrre companies whose securities
are
registered under Section 12 to file periodrc and current reports in proper form;
Section 12(k) of the Exchange Act which
authorizes the Oomrnlssron to suspend
temporarily trading in the securities of issuers, and Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act which requires broker-dealers
making specrnc quotations in an Interdealer quotation medium to have available certain Information
regarding the
Issuer of the securities quoted.
During the 1975 fiscal year, the Comrnrssion temporarily suspended trading In
of approximately
thirty
the secunties
companies solely due to the lack of current and adequate
Information.
They
hadn't even filed at least a Form 1o-K
annual report dlsclosmq
their audited
financial condition and results of operations.
During this fiscal year, the Commission
brought thirteen CIVil injunctive actions 15
solely on the basis of the Issuers' failure
to comply with the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act. In some of these
actions, the chief operating officer was
included as a defendant for his alleged
failure to cause the company to file the
delinquent reports.
For example, on December 20, 1974 an
action was filed against Data Lease
Financial Corporation ("Data Lease"), a
bank holding company, in which It was
alleged that Data Lease was delinquent
In filing its Annual Report on Form 1o-K
for ItS fiscal year ended June 30, 1974
and an amendment to its Form 1o-K for
fiscal year ended June 30, 1973. The
Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment was granted by the court on Feb-

ruary 14, 1975. Data Lease was ordered
to file the delinquent reports immediately,
and a permanent Injunction was Issued
against further Violations of the reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act. One
week later, the delinquent reports were
filed with the Commission.
After an issuer has been enjoined from
of the
violating the reporting provisrons
Exchange Act, the program rnorutors ItS
SUbsequent compliance With the court's
order. If It continues to Violate the reportIng requirements
of the Exchange Act
and the court's order to file timely and
proper reports, further action may be
instituted. In the past fiscal year, proceedings
seeking to hold three such
companies and certain of their officers In
CIVil contempt of prior injunctive orders
were
initiated
and successfully
concluded.16
The Commission hopes this program
has succeeded
in making issuers increasingly
aware of the Importance It
attaches to the prompt filing of required
reports, and the necessity of informing
shareholders why such reports are not
being filed on time and furnishing them
with any available preliminary financial
and operational information.

CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
DUring fiscal 1975, the Oomrnissron
Instituted a total of 174 injunctive actions.
Some of the more noteworthy injunctive
proceedings
and Significant
developments in actions instituted In earlier years
are reported below. Several of these enforcement actions were achieved through
coordination
between
self-regulatory
bodies and the Drvlsron of Enforcement.

S.E.C. v, PhIllips Petroleum Company.
On March 6, 1975, the Commission filed
a complaint against Phillips Petroleum
Company and several of its past and
present officers and directors to enjoin
them from further Violations of Sections
12(b), 13(a) and 14(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act and rules thereunder. The
complaint
alleged that the defendants
maintained a secret fund of corporate
monies which were used for unlawful
political
contributions
and other pur-

poses. In particular, It was alleged that
durtnq the period from 1963 to 1975, the
defendants disbursed In excess of $2.8
million In Phillips's corporate funds to
two SWISScorporations by means of false
entries on the books and records of
Phillips. These disbursements were then
converted Into cash. In excess of $1.3
million of this fund were returned to the
United States of which about $600,000
was expended for political contributions
and related expenses, a substantial portion of which was unlawful. The balance
of the funds was allegedly channelled
Into the SWISS corporations and distributed overseas In cash.
Each of the defendants
consented,
Without admitting or denying the facts set
forth In the complaint, to the entry of a
permanent injunction
prohibiting
future
violations of the Federal securities laws.
In addition, Phillips undertook to prepare
a written report descnbmq ItS Internal
investigations
Into the matters set forth
In the Commission's complaint together
with the results thereof and to make appropriate disclosure of the matters Involved In thrs report to its shareholders.
On April 11, 1975, the Commission
filed a complaint
against Accuracy In
Media, Inc. ("AIM"), a non-partisan and
non-profit organization
devoted to promoting accuracy and correcting errors in
the media, seeking to enjoin AIM from
violations of the proxy provrsrons of the
Exchange Act and rules thereunderP
The complaint alleged that AIM solicited
proxies by means of newspaper advertisements while falling to furnish the shareholders of RCA Corporation
and CBS,
Inc.,
with
written
proxy
statements
containing
certain specnlc Information.
It was also alleged that AIM failed to file
With the Commission copies of preliminary proxy statements furnished to shareholders of RCA Corporation
and CBS,
In Rule
Inc., Within the time prescribed
14&-6. The complaint further alleged that
AIM's newspaper advertisements Violated
Rule 14a-9 in that such advertisements
contained statements whrcn, at the time
and In light of the circumstances under
which they were made, omitted to state
material facts necessary in order to make
103

the statements
contained
therein
not
misleading. In addition, the Commission
sought to require AIM to publish corrective advertisements and to make an offer
to return all contributions
received In
response to AIM's initial advertisements.
AIM consented without admitting or
denying the allegations of the complaint
to the entry of a final Judgment of permanent injunction enjoining it from vrolatIng Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act
and Rules 14a-3, 14a-6, and 14a-9 thereunder. The Court's order further provided
that AIM publish the corrective advertisements and make an offer to return the
contnbutions received In response to the
initial advertisements.
In S.E.C. v. Management
DynamIcs,
Inc.,18 the court of appeals affirmed a
preliminary Injunction for Violation of the
registration provisions of the Securities
Act and the antifraud provrsrons of Section 10(b) of the Securttres Exchange Act
and Rule 10b--5 by a lawyer responsible
for the dissemination of almost a rmlhon
unregistered
shares
of
Management
Dynamics's
stock in relatively
smalldenomination certificates.
These shares
were in the name of a person who had
purported to represent one or more foreign Investors, but who, In fact, attempted
to sell the shares Within the United States.
The court also upheld a preliminary
Injunction against a broker-dealer firm,
which had acted as market maker for
Management Dynamics's stock, for Violation of the antifraud provisions of the
securities laws. The firm's vice-president
In charge of trading continued trading
the shares even though there was no
logical explanation for a pnce nse from
$0.38 to $6 00 In a penod of about six
months and the company had not responded to an Inquiry for Information
sent by the broker-dealer. The court of
appeals stated that It agreed With the
Commission's position that Section 20(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act "was not
intended as the sole measure of employer
liability"
In
an
enforcement
action
brought by the Commission,
because
Section 20(a) was "enacted to expand,
rather than restnct, the scope of liability
under the secunties laws."
104

The court also explicitly
held that
"proof of Irreparable injury or inadequacy
of other remedies as in the usual suit for
injunction"
is not required in an injunction action brought by the Commission.
S.E.C. v. Geon Industries,
Inc.,19 involved trading
on rnsrde
information
about a proposed merger between Geon
and Burmah Oil Co., Ltd., of Great Bntam,
The complaint charged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
and Ru Ie 10b--5 In connection with several purchases of Geon stock by individuals who knew about the state of the
merger negotiations that was not publicly
known. It also charged violations of those
provtsrons and of Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act In connection with the sale
of Geon stock by persons having inside
knowledge that the merger might not go
through. Also, violations of Section 10(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule
10b--5 were charged
against
Geon's
secretary-treasurer,
who, when the stock
exchange on which the Geon stock was
trading mquired whether there was any
reason for a large Imbalance of sell orders, stated that he knew of none, thus
resulting in the commencement of trading
In Geon stock, when he knew that insiders had become aware that the merger
might fail.20
The district court held 21 that the company's president Violated the antifraud
provrsrons by disclosing non public information about the fact and progress of
the proposed merger, which resulted in
purchases and sales of Geon stock, and
that Geon was liable for these acts of its
president. The court refused to hold that
a brokerage firm was liable for purchases
and sales made by a registered representative on the basis of Inside information,
although the registered
representative
consented to an injunction against him.
The court also refused to hold liable the
secretary-treasurer
of Geon for his alleged misleading statements to the stock
exchange. Geon and its president have
appealed, as has the Commission.
In May 1975, the Commission filed a
complaint in the United States District

17% of GRX's outstanding common stock,
and that In an effort to conceal these
holdings failed to file with the Commission the required reports on Schedule
130 when he acquired In excess of 5% of
GRX's outstanding stock. In addition, the
complaint alleged that, with the assistance of SWISS Bank Corporation,

Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act in
connection with his purchase, as part of a
group, of in excess of 5% of GRX's outstanding stock without filing the required
report on Schedule 130.
The complaint further charges that the
defendants failed to disclose in filings
with the Cornmlsston that Hermann Mayer
and the defendant companies owned or
controlled by him have engaged In extensive business transactions with GRX

undisclosed group, also effected a manipulative
series of transactions
and
further participated In the alleged manipulation by, among other things, effecting
wash sales and matched orders and sales
with Corr as part of the defendants'
overall scheme to create a false and
misleading appearance of active trading
In American Agronomics stock. In addition, the complaint
alleged
that the
defendants
made certain false filings,
which omitted to disclose sources of
funds used to buy the stock and the
existence of the group, and failed to
make certain required filings With the
Commission regarding their purchases of
American Agronomics stock. The complaint further charged that certain of
Hamilton's shares had been sold In Violation of the registration requirements and

S.A. (Costa Rica), et al.2M, the Commission filed a complaint on September 3,
1974 alleging anti-fraud violations and
seeking Injunctive relief and the appointment of the receiver
The complaint alleged that beginning
about September 1968 and continuing to
the present, Clovis W McAlpin, Capital

EHG Enterprrses, Inc., Arrel E Gutierrez
and Enrique H. Gutierrez ("EHG") con107

verted and misappropriated the assets of
the Capital Growth companies for their
own benefit The draining of the assets
of Capital Growth companies was accomplished through 'a series of self-dealing
transactions which Included eliminating
the Independent trustee, the close-ending
of the Capital Growth companies and the
diversion of the marketable assets of the
Capital Growth companies Into newlyformed entities owned or controlled by
certain of the defendants or their associates.
An order of preliminary Injunction was
entered and a receiver was appointed.
Sheffield
consented
to a permanent
Injunction and a final judgment of default
was entered against the remaining defendants, over the argument of EHG, who
contended that telephoruc notice of the
temporary restraining order was inadequate and that service of the summons
and complaint was not made In a timely
manner. These defendants
were then
granted
additional
time to file their
answer and present factual evidence why
the preliminary relief granted should not
stand. Ttus was not done.
Defendants appealed from the decisron
of the District Court and urged the Court
to
of Appeals for the Second Ctrcurt
vacate the order of preliminary injunction
and the appointment of a receiver On
June 2, 1975, the Court of Appeals for
the Second circurt, In an unwritten opmIon affirming the lower court's decrslon

the proceedings and were given an adequate opportunity to present their objections to the relief granted by the District
Court.
SEC v J&B Industnes, Inc 2" On September 3, 1974, the Commission filed a
complaint against J&B Industries, Inc.,
and nine other defendants alleging that
"special land rights" representing fractronahzed Interests In a large tract of
Canadian land constituted a security In
the form of an Investment contract that
was being offered and sold In Violation
of the registration and anti-fraud provrsions of the Federal securities laws.
Although each purchaser received title
108

In fee Simple, the defendants retained
total control
over all Investments by
havrnq each Investor execute an "Irrevocable power of attorney" and a "firm
option" In favor of the defendants contemporaneously With each purchase.
On October 2, 1974 the court Issued a

SEC v Bull Investment
Group.30 On
December 20, 1974 the Oornrmssron filed
SUit In the Federal District Court for the
District of Massachusetts charging Bull
Investment Group, Ronald Kimball, Richard G. Grondin, Richard F. Tosti, Golden
Book of Values and James Sanford with
violating the registration and anti-fraud
provrslons of the federal securities laws.
The complaint, alleging that the defendants sold investment contracts in the
form of pyramid marketing plans, sought
Injunctive relief and the appointment of a
receiver.
After an evidentrary hearing, the court
noted the parallels
between the Bull
Investment Group case and the SEC v
Glenn Turner Enterpnses, tnc., 474 F. 2d
476 (C.A 9, 1973) and SEC v. Koscot
Interplanetary,
Inc., 497 F. 2d 473 (C. A
5, 1974), indicated that the Commission
would probably succeed In establishing
that the defendants pyramid plan was an
investment
contract,
and accordingly
entered a preliminary injunction on March
11, 1975 The Cornrnrsston's monon for
default judgment was granted against the
defendants Bull, Kimball, Grondin, and
Tosti for their failure to comply With the
Court's order compelling discovery. The
matter IS stili pending against Golden
Book and Sanford.
Noteworthy collateral matters were In
Issue during the course of the litigation.
The Commrssron on February 4, 1975
moved that the defendant's answer be
stricken because It was filed In bad faith
In that It contained many patently false
assertions. The motion was subsequently
granted, but the defendants were granted
leave to amend. During the course of the

hearing
on preliminary
injunction
a
"clean hand" defense was raised, assertIng that the Commission had violated Its
own rules of confidentiality
by providing
Information gathered from the defendants
to other law enforcement agencies. The
court, after taking testimony on the Issue,
rejected the defense. Finally, the Cornrrussron, upon learning that the defendants
were Violating the preliminary injunction,
moved to modify that order to Insure that
the injunction would be honored. After a
heanng concerning these vrolatrons, the
court entered an order which broadened
the injunctron's
scope,
and Installed
rnorutorrnq devices to Insure compliance.

Invested capital, the commingling
and
rnisappropnatron
of funds of the limited
partnerships and the failure to drstnbute
proportionate
shares of the proceeds of

The complaint also alleged that Bernard Tolkow, the busmess manager of
United Welfare Fund and another defendant, caused United to provide monies to
Garfinkle by purchasrnq participations
In
short-term notes collateralized
by mortgages on properties
sold to limited
partnerships,
and that Garfinkle rnrsappropnated for hrs own benefit the rnorues

on Investments
by Tolkow
In limited
partnerships. Dlsgorgement
IS sought of
funds received by Garfinkle from investors and received by Tolkow from Gar-

or
denying the allegations of the complaint,
consented to orders permanently enjoinIng them from further Violations of the
registration

Cornrnrssron instituted an injunctive action against Bngadoon Scotch Distnbutors, Ltd. and 26 other defendants alleging
violatrons of the registration
and antifraud provisions of the Federal securities
laws In connection with the offer and sale
by the defendants of Investment Interests
In scotch whisky and rare COin portfoliOS.
109

Of particular note, and a question of first
Impression was the charge In the Commission's complaint
that the offer and
sale of rare COin portfolios by the Federal
COin Reserve, Inc ("FCR")
constituted
the offer and sale of a security subject to
the junsdictron
of the federal securities
laws
In this regard, the court In an opinion
dated February 10, 1975, after a hearing
on the Commission's
motion for a preliminary rnjunctron against FCR, ItS principals and key sales personnel, found
that the Investment Interests in rare COin
portfolios being offered and sold by the
defendants to the investing public did, In
fact, constitute the offer and sale of a
security within the province of the Federal
secunties
laws, Accordingly,
the court
granted the Commission's request for a
preliminary mjunctron.
In SEC v Robert Dale Johnson, et al.l~
the Commission, on June 14, 1974, filed

SEC

v. North American
Acceptance
On February 7, 1975, the
Commission filed a complaint seeking to
enjorn North American Acceptance Corporation (NAAC), a Georgia corporation,
and 10 other defendants alleging Violations of the registration
and antifraud
provrsrons
of the securities
acts
The
complaint alleges that NAAC and others
made false and misleading
statements
and omitted to state material facts In the
sale of ItS high interest unsecured corporate notes to residents of Georgia.
Among other things, these statements
related to the use of proceeds; that land
development companies owned by NAAC
were causing a negative cash flow for
NAAC; that NAAC was having liquidity
problems; that financial
statements did
not reflect substantial
changes in the
financial condition of NAAC; that NAAC's
parent corporation,
Omega-Alpha,
Inc.
(OA) was losing money; and that millions
of dollars transferred from NAAC to OA
were being utilized by OA for working
capital and the retirement of debt not
related to NAAC.

Corporetion.v:

NAAC sold
promissory
notes With
maturity dates of one to five years and
promissory notes payable on demand In
January 1974, NAAC mailed an annual
financial
statement
to ItS noteholders
which contained adverse information
As
the result of thrs information, noteholders
Immediately began to demand the return
of their Investment
which NAAC was
unable to repay. Thereafter, on February
6, 1974, NAAC filed a petition under
Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act which
was later converted to a Chapter X proceeding. About 5,000 Investors stili hold
NAAC notes aggregating $38,000,000.
In S.E.C. v Cambndge
Capital Corporation, et al.:17 and S.E.C. v. Interstate
Syndications,
Inc, et al.,IS the Commission Instituted injunctive actions against
two Atlanta-based land syndication companies charging Violations of the regisprovrsions
of the
tration and antifraud
securities
laws
Both companies
were
engaged In the business of seiling Invest-

ments In various tracts of raw land In the
form of either limited partnership interests or co-tenancy Interests In the real
estate. The sales terms of these real
estate syndication
Interests called Initially for downpayrnents and later for
yearly payments by each Investor to
cover the annual mortgage, Interest and
real estate tax obuqanons relating to
each tract of raw land. In order to protect
the Investors' Interests In the real estate,
a court-appointed
agent was needed to
administer the receipt and disbursement
of the funds. In each SUit, the court, at the
request of the Commission, appointed a
special fiscal agent to administer the
various land syndications. Because these
Interests were frequently sold to persons
who were told or led to believe that they
would not have to make more than one or
two of the annual payments before the
land was "turned over" at a profit and because the raw land was not producrnq
any Income, the special fiscal agents
encountered
difficulties
preserving the
Investors' interests
Subsequent efforts
made by the court, the special fiscal
agents and the Commission's staff have
been directed toward minimizing Investor
loss In the adverse climate of a tight
money market and a general recession

In a nationwide campaign to sell the
Scotch whisky interests and that in some
cases the prices for the whisky Interests

further
alleged that In connection with the sale
of those interests in scotch whisky the
defendants made untrue statements of
material facts including, but not hrruted
to, statements that Investors would obtain
profits of 20% per year, that overproduc-

tion of scotch whisky was an Investment
risk, and that there are no qualitative
differences between various scotch gram
whiskies. Also It was alleged that the
defendants omitted to state certain facts
necessary to make the statements made
not misleading Among other things, the
defendants did not disclose the amount

the Commission
The firm, three of ItS
prlnctpals and two sales personnel were
defendants in the action which the Comrrussron instituted In the United States
District Court for the Southern District

Corporation,
charging
violations by all the defendants of the
anti-fraud,
reporting
and

manner In which they would conduct the
business of the drilling programs In a
way materially
at variance

literature, and Ignored the warnings of
their tax counsel as to the possible
adverse tax consequences of such conduct.
The Commission alleged that the defendants engineered a series of sham
transactions In late 1972 which were of
doubtful validity from a tax viewpomt,
and which had not been disclosed to
Investors
Investors were Informed by
Prudential as to the availability of leveraged tax deductions (In excess of their
cash Investment) for their 1972 tax returns, Without being Informed as to the
nature of the transactions

112

which prohibited the named defendants
from violating the registration and antilaws
fraud provrsrons of the secuntres
The JUdgment also provided for certain
ancillary

The defendants
were
enjoined from altering, destroying, concealing,
dissipating,
disclosing,
transferring or moving any books, records,
documents,
correspondence,
funds or
assets of the defendants. The Judgment
continued the appointment of a receiver
of all assets and property of, belonging to,
or in possession of the defendants which

and practices complained of. It required
the defendants to make an accounting of
all funds received from investors in connection with the silver investment agreements, and to disgorge to the receiver any
and all funds and silver which they
received as a result of their sales and
purchases of the secunnes described in
the complaint.
In addition, In fiscal 1975, the Commission filed S.E.C. v. SIlver Mint Mortgage,
Co., Ltd, et al.,~6 S.E.C. v. Constitution
Mint, Inc., et al.,47 and S.E.C. v. Douglas
S. Warren, et al.~H Preliminary or final

above cases
S.E.C. v. Seaboard Corp.~9-The Comrrussron obtained
consent
Injunctions
against all but two of the twenty-nine
defendants In this previously reported 50
case. The SUit dealt essentially with the
alleged
mismanagement
and outright
looting of a complex of mutual funds
("Funds").
The complaint alleged that a portfolio
manager of the Funds engaged In a
practice of first purchasing thinly traded
securities through nominees, then causIng the Funds to purchase the same securities In large volume, thereby causing a
price rise. He then allegedly sold his
personal holdings either to the Funds or
Into the market when the Funds were
bUying As a result, the Funds were alleged to have lost as much as $4,000,000.
The complaint also alleged that finders'
fees In excess of $200,000 were Illegally
paid to affiliates of the Funds and that
secunnes
were purchased,
Investment

advisers selected and other decrsions
relating to the Investment funds made In
order to benefit Seaboard and ItS affiliates
to the detriment of the Funds.
In additron to enjoining the defendants
from further violations of the antifraud
provrsrons of the federal secuntres laws,
the court has Imposed other sanctions,
mctudmq the payment of money to the
Funds and to special funds administered
by the court for the benefit of other
classes of persons who were Injured

injunctive action against Hepublrc Natronal life Insurance Company ("RepubIre"), Realty Equines Corporation of New
York ("Realty"),
Peat, Marwlck, Mitchell
& Company ("PMM"), Westhelmer, Fine,
Berger & Co. ("Westhelmer"), and eleven
mdrviduals who were employees of Republic
or
Realty
The
Commission
charged extensive violations of antifraud
and reporting provisrons of the Exchange
Act. In essence, the complaint alleged
that Republic, In trying to conceal Its
failing Investment In Realty, put rnuuons
of dollars Into Realty through certain
transactions
The proceeds were usually
channeled back to Republic to repay
earlier Realty debt Realty was thus enabled to retain suttrcrent funds through
the transactrons to continue In operation
Republic and Realty and each of their
Independent
auditors were alleged to
have made and Issued false and mrsteadIng financial statements.
Republic,
Realty, PMM, Westhelmer,
and eight of the eleven individual defendants consented to permanent injunctions
enjoining them from future vrolatrons of
various provrsrons of the Exchange Act.
Certain of the defendants also consented
to ancillary remedies designed to prevent
recurrences
of VIOlative conduct. The
litigation
IS continuing With respect to
three remaining defendants.
S.E.C. v, MatteI, Inc n-In
two separate
proceedings dunnq 1974, Mattei, Inc, a
California toy manufacturer, was enjoined
on ItS consent from Violating the antifraud
and reporting provrsions of the Securities
113

Exchange Act. The alleqatrons related to
material misstatements In MatteI's financial statements durrnq 1971 through 1973
and press releases Issued during that
period
In addrtron to the rnjunctrons, the court
ordered that Mattei (1) appoint and maintain a majority of Its directors who are
unaffiliated with Mattei, (2) maintain committees of such Independent directors to
review financial
controls
and auditing
procedures and also lrtrqatton, (3) appoint
a special counsel to Investigate the matters alleged In the complaint, to report hrs
findings to the court and the Commission
and to Initiate actions on behalf of the
company against management, and (4)
appoint a special auditor to examine the
company's past financial statements
S E.C. v Solnron Devices, Inc "~-In an
action filed In March 1975, the Commission obtained
a final
order
against
Solltron Devices, Inc. on allegations that
Solltron's
1967 through
1970 Annual
Reports on Form 1G-K were false and
misleading
because the accompanying
audited financial
statements
matenally
overstated
the value of ItS Inventory,
sales and accounts receivable and ItS
pre-tax and net Income In addition, the
complaint alleged that Solltron's annual
and other reports from 1971 and audited
financial
statements failed to disclose
that a substantial part of the wntedown
of Solltron's Inventory described therein
was due to, among other things, Solltron's
falsification
of ItS prior tmancral statements and that Solltron had a substantial
contingent
liability
arising
out of ItS
prror falsified financial statements
The court ordered Solltron, With ItS
consent, to file timely complete
and
accurate annual and penodic reports With
the Commission containing all material
facts. Further, Solltron was ordered to
make only such public statements as are
complete and accurate In all material
respects.
Moreover, the court's order directed
the company to restate correctly ItS prior
filings which were the subject of the
Commission's
complaint.
Finally,
the
court directed Solrtron to retain specral
counsel, satisfactory to the Commission,
114

to accomplish the matters referred to In a
strpulatron and undertaking executed by
Solltron and annexed to the court's order
and to comply fully With the snpulanons
and undertakings contained therein
S.E C. v Savoy Industnes
Corporation ;;-Thls
case exemplifies
how cooperative
efforts of the Commission's
staff and self-regulatory
bodies produce
effective enforcement actron. On November 22, 1974, the Commission, after an
investigation
resulting from information
received from the American Stock Exchange, instituted
an injunctive
action
against Savoy and five other defendants
alleging Violations of the reporting and
anti-fraud
provrsions
of the Federal
secunties
laws. The complaint
alleged
that the defendants
made numerous
fraudulent misstatements of material facts
and omitted to state other material facts
In reports requtred to be filed With the
Commission
and the Arnencan
Stock
Exchange The defendants were charged
With failing to disclose the role of one of
the defendants as a controlling factor In a
scheme to acquire Savoy stock and that
the real purpose of the acqursrtron was to
turn Savoy Into an Insurance holding
company
Savoy and three other defendants,
Without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to permanent rnjuncnons enjoining them from further Violations of the reporting
and anti-fraud
provrsrons of the Federal secunnes laws.
In additron, all defendants who acquired
shares of Savoy common stock have
agreed not to dispose of those shares for
at least two years.
Three CIVil actions were initiated dunng
fiscal 1974 by the Cornrrussron against
Honda-based
Issuers
of unregistered
mortgage notes and the mortgage brokers
seiling the notes. These actions against
a total of 21 defendants, were captioned
S.E.C v Continental Land Management
Corp ,": S.E C v. L. T P. Properties, lnc.,"
and S.E.C v Horowitz,"
Each of the
cases Included charges of Violations of
registration and anti-fraud provrsrons by
the Issuers and sellers of corporate
promissory notes collateralized
by mortgages or assignments of Installment land

sales contracts
Typically, the lots purportedly mortgaged or assigned to investors were, at best, much less valuable
than represented
and, at worst, nonexistent
The Issuer in each of these
cases IS currently in receivership
as a
result of the Commission
action or In
bankruptcy
proceedings.

PARTICIPATION AS
AMICUS CURIAE
Slade
v Shearson,
Hemmttt
& Co,
Inc.fi9-ln this action brought pursuant to
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act and Rule 101>-5 thereunder, an investor was seeking damages suffered when
she purchased securities on the baSIS of
the recommendations
of a salesman of
the defendant made at a time when the
defendant's
Investment banking department was In possession of adverse material non-public
information
about the
Issuer of the secunties, which was also
an investment banking client. Shearson
asserted that ItS Internal poucies prohibited the firm from making any recommendations With respect to Investment
banking
clients,
although
individual
salesmen of the firm were permitted to
make recommendations
based on their
analyses of publicly
available information. Shearson contended
that It was
precluded from uSing mside Information
In the possession of ItS Investment bankIng department
for the benent of ItS
brokerage
customers,
and
that
thrs
would be the case If It caused its salesmen to Withdraw
outstanding
recommendations after receipt of the adverse
non-publrc mtorrnatron. The lower court
denied Shearson's motion for a partial
summary Judgment and certified a controlling question of law to the Second
crrcuit
for Interlocutory
appeal
The
Second Ctrcurt accepted the certrtrcatron
The Ccrnmisston
as emtcus curtee
argued In the court of appeals that tms
case should not be viewed as governed
solely by cases where an insrder takes
advantage of inaide information In effectIng securities transactions
In thrs case,

noted, the broker's recthe Oomrrussron
ornrnendatron
did not permit hrs customer
to benefit from mside information; rather,
the recornendanon
was that, notwithstanding
material
adverse information,
the customer buy the securities In question
In these circumstances,
another
principle becomes applicable, specifically,
the Cornrrusston argued, Rule 101>-5 must
be Interpreted to prohibit a recommendanon contrary to non-public facts about the
security In question known by the brokerdealer
The preservation
of necessary
restrictions upon the use of material inSide information does not require that the
broker's misrepresentations
be condoned
They could be avorded With no drastrc
affects on a multi-function securities firm
If, In addrtron to separating ItS departments and not allowrnq non-public information to pass from the Investment
banking department to the broker-dealer
department, the firm would also use a
devrce such as a restricted lrst, pursuant
to which the firm and ItS salesmen would
be prevented from making recommendations With respect to securities at such
times as the firm may have, or IS likely to
obtain, material mside information
This
device would enable the firm to avoid
inadvertant Violations by salesmen who
are unaware of mstde information
that
may be inconsistent With the mtorrnanon
which served as the baSIS for the recommendation
On December 16, 1974, the court of
appeals held that ItS acceptance of the
certification
of the question for review
had been rmprovrdently
granted,
and
remanded the case to the district court
Noting the Implications the resolution of
this case had for both the secunties
Industry and the investing
public, the
court decided
that It would
proceed
further In thrs case only on the baSIS of
full findings of fact and a consequent
narrowing of the Issues
In Schltck
v Penn-Dixie
Cement Corporeuon, et al.,"<1 the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second CirCUIt reversed a lower court ruling which had
dismissed the complaint
The complaint
was filed by minority shareholders
of
Continental Steel Corporatron
It alleged
115

violatrons of sections 10(b) and 14(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act and Rules
It charged
10b-5 and 14a-9 thereunder
that Penn-DIxie, as the majority shareholder of Continental,
engaged
In a
scheme to manipulate the business affairs of Continental, thereby depressing
the market price of Continental stock In
relation to that of Penn-DIxie, In order to
effect a merger between the two companies on the basts of an exchange ratio
that reflected the manipulated price, and
was thus unfair to the minority shareholders of Continental. Penn-DIxie was
also alleged to have failed to disclose
certain facts concerning the scheme In
proxy materials sent to Continental shareholders In connection with the merger
With respect to plaintiff's claim under
Rule 10b-5, the court of appeals held, In
substantial agreement with the posrtron
taken by the Commission In an amicus
curiee brief, that where a majority shareholder engages In "a scheme to defraud"
minority
shareholders,
which
Includes
market marupulatron and a merger on
preferential terms, of which alleged orrussions and rmsrepresentatrons contained
In proxy soliciting material are only one
aspect, a plaintiff need allege only that
he suffered economic harm In order to
state a cause of action (I.e., that the
exchange ratio arguably would have been
fairer had the baSIS for valuation been
disclosed)
The plaintiff did not have to
allege that the merger transacnon itself
was "caused" by material ornrssrons and
misrepresentations
The court of appeals also held, again
In substantial agreement with the position
of the Commission on the allegations
about Rule 14a-9, that certain misstatements or ormssrons In the proxy materials
were material and that the proxy solicitation was an essential link In effecting the
merger, were sufficient to plead the element of causation In the merger transaction and, therefore, were sufficient
to
state a cause of action under those
provrsions In this regard, the court observed, among other things, that If shareholders had been fully Informed, they
may have had recourse to measures
other than the casting of proxies In op116

posing the merger, or at least, have been
In a better position
to protect their
Interests

CRIMINAL

PROCEEDINGS

As a result of investigations conducted
by ItS staff, the Commission during the
past fiscal year referred BB cases to the
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution
This represents a substantial
Increase over the 65 cases referred during the preceding fiscal year. As a result
of these references, 53 indictments naming 199 defendants were returned, as
compared to 40 indictments
against a
total of 169 defendants dunng the previous
year In addition, dunng the past fiscal
year, the Commission authonzed its staff
to file 17 crtrnmal contempt actions, and
convictions
were obtained
against 10
defendants. Dunng the past fiscal year,
116 defendants were convicted In the 33
cnrnrnal cases that were tried. Oonvrcnons were affirmed In 6 cases that had
been appealed, and appeals were stili
pending In 5 other cases at the close of
the penod.
Members of the staff of the Comrnisston
who have investigated a case and are
familiar with the facts Involved and the
applicable statutory provisions and legal
pnncrples, are usually requested by the
Department of Justice to participate and
assist In the tnal of a cnrrunal case referred to the Department, and to partrcipate and assist In any subsequent appeal
from a conviction.
The cnrnrnal cases that were handled
dunng the fiscal year demonstrated the
great variety of fraudulent practices that
have been devised and employed against
members of the Investing public.
After three weeks of tnal,hl J Harlow
Tucker of Spokane, Washington,
pled
gUilty to five counts of an indictment
chargmg securities fraud and mall fraud
The defendant defrauded In excess of
1,300 mvestors, resrdmq pnrnanly In eastern Washington, of more than $4,000,000
through the sale of common stock and
subordinated
convertible
debentures of
The Davenport Hotel, Inc. and other investment programs related thereto. Funds

raised were purportedly
to be used to
renovate The Davenport Hotel, a landmark located In Spokane, Washington,
and to butld an adjacent
convention
center, but were In fact primarily used
for other
undisclosed
purposes.
The
defendant capitalized on the area's sentimental attachment to the hotel and a
promise to pay an 8% return on the debentures, which enabled Tucker to sell securities to numerous older retired persons
and many others who had never previously Invested In securities.
Sentencing has been delayed by the
court pending a pre-sentence investigation report.

Gary J. Awad was the Operations Manager for some 9 years In the Detrort
branch of a large brokerage firm which
was and IS a member of the New York
Stock Exchange. In August, 1970, Awad
trading account at
opened a secuntres
the firm In a ncnuous name and from that
time to about October,
1973, effected

numerous purchases and sales In the
account
DUring that same period, he
was able to alter the records of ms employer to reflect receipt Into the account
of various secuntres,
which were either
nonexistent or the property of other customers of the firm. USing these Securities
supposedly In the account as "collateral,"
Awad caused the nrm to Issue checks
out of the account, the proceeds of which
Awad converted to hrs own use and benefit. Since Awad had authorrty
to srqn
checks drawn on the firm's bank accounts, he was able to have checks
Issued to the person In whose name the
account was maintained, sign thrs name
on the back of the checks, and deposit or
cash the checks at banks where Awad
maintained
accounts
In the fictitious
name. During the period the scheme was
In operation, the purchases and sales In
the account resulted In a loss to the firm
of about $80,000. In addition,
checks
issued out of the account to the purported
customer totaled about $124,200, compared to deposits Into the account of
some $42,800, or a loss to the firm of an

partners used nominees to conceal their
ownership of XPnnt stock at a time when

their firm was underwnting the offering,

Organized Crime Program
The prosecution of secunties cases IS
often based pnrnarrly on crrcurnstantral
evidence requiring
extensive investigation by highly trained personnel. The difIn
such
rnvestiqatrons
and
ficulties
prosecutions
are
compounded
when
elements of organized
crime are involved. Witnesses are usually reluctant
to cooperate because of threats or fear of
physrcat harm Books, records, and other
119

documentary
evidence essential to the
investigation and to a successful prosecution may be destroyed or nonexistent
The organized crime element IS adept at
dtsquistnq
ItS partrcipatron
In transactions, through the use of aliases and
nominee accounts, by operating across
international
boundaries, and by taking
advantage of foreign bank secrecy laws
It frequently
operates through "fronts"
and infiltrates
legitimate
business concerns Organized crime also has an extensive network of affiliates throughout
this country In all walks of life, and In
many foreign nations As a result of these
problems, civu and criminal htrqatron involvmq organized
crime can result In
unusually lengthy proceedings.
Despite
workthese difficulties,
the Commrsston,
Ing In cooperation With other enforcement
agencies, has been able to make major
contributions
to
the
fight
against
organized crime
DUring fiscal year 1975, the organized
crime program focused pnncipally on two
ends (1) increasing
the Commission's
effectiveness In obtaining current reliable
information relating to organized criminal
activity
In the securitres
Industry; and
(2) aggressively
pursuing to completion
investigations of srtuations brought to the
Commission's attention as potentially involvmq the mnltratron
of elements of
organized crime Into the Industry.
In order to Increase the flow of reliable
data, an intelligence unit was established
last year In the Drvtsron of Enforcement.
Its pnncipal function IS to maintain channels of communication
With state, local
and other Federal agencies, as well as
comparable
agencies of foreign governments, which might have information on
organized criminal activity In the securities Industry Information received by this
unit IS correlated
With other available
information and evaluated In light of the
Commission's
responsrbrutres under the
Federal secunties laws Information indicating possible secunties law Violations
by organized criminal elements IS relayed
by the intelligence
unit to those other
members of the staff whose pnncipal
duties are to investigate activity by organized crime This program has already
120

generated a significant
number of new
cases, as well as contributing new sources
of information to ongoing investigations
In furtherance of the intelligence function, members of the staff have continued
to participate
In seminars and lectures
sponsored by state and local governments
and their representatives
have been included
In the Commission's
training
programs This has alerted local authorrties to the role of the Commission
In
curtailing
organized criminal activity In
Industry. Members of the
the secuntres
Commission staff are also assiqnad on a
full time basts to certain of the Justice
Department's
Organized
Crime
Strike
Forces. Both the Strike Forces and the
Commission staff have thereby benefited
In learning more about organized criminal
activity In the secuntres Industry.
As a result of the organized crime unit's
enforcement efforts dunnq the past fiscal
year, there has been an Increase In the
number and Importance of actions in this
area In the past year, In cases where
members of organized
crime were involved, the Oornrrussron filed Injunctive
actions
naming 47 persons and contributed to the return of indictments namIng 47 individuals and the convrctron of
34 of them. Three persons considered to
be Important members of organized crime
were indicted and three such members
were convicted on indictments

As a result of an intensive Oornrmssron
investigation
and the efforts of the Organized Cnme Stnke Force in Manhattan,
a Federal grand jury In the Southern DIstrict of New York on August 9, 1974 indicted 15 individuals,
including John J
Santiago a/k/a Sonny Santini, nine past
or present brokers and an attorney, for
consprrary
to Violate and substantive
Violations of the antifraud provrsions of
the secuntres laws, together With mall

Eight defendants pled gUilty before trial
and four more were convicted on March

defendant was acquitted and two remain
to be tned The case Involved Issuance of

unregistered shares of common stock In
Elmvest, Inc. and the subsequent sale of
this stock to the public at artificially
Inflated prices.
In another
significant
case, Sidney
Stein and 9 others were indicted In June
1974 In the Southern District of New York
In connection With a widespread fraudulent drstnbution
of Stern-Haskell,

stock They were charged With sales of
unregistered stock, secunnes fraud, mall
fraud and conspiracy In the case of U.S. v.
Rubinson, et al.'i. On March 23, 1975,
Stein and 6 other defendants were convicted of these charges. As a result of
Stein's role In ttus fraud and hrs long

by personnel from state secunties agencies, the U.S. Postal Service, Federal,
state and local prosecutors'
offices and
local offices of self-regulatory
associations, such as the NASD. They provide a
forum for the exchange of information on
current enforcement
problems and new
methods of enforcement cooperation. One
result of these conferences has been the
establishment
of programs for JOint investigations.
Although
the conferences
were initially hosted by the Commission's
regional offices, many state and local
agencies are now serving as sponsors or
co-sponsors.
During
the past several
years, the Commission's DIVISion of Enforcement
has conducted
Enforcement
Training Seminars to which were mvrted
representatives of all the state secunnes
ag~ncles and their counterparts
In the

Cooperation with Other
Enforcement Agencies

Canadian provinces lnvitatrons were also
extended to other Federal agencies havIng investigative or enforcement responsibrhtres
involvrnq laws relating to the
Issuance of or transactions In securities
A shortage of funds In fiscal 1975 resulted
In a determination
not to conduct this
seminar In the past year.
The Commission's
Proceedings
and
litigation
Records Branch continues to
provide one means for cooperation on a
continuing basis With other agencies havIng securities enforcement responsibilities.
The Branch acts as a clearinghouse
for

maintained
by the

actions taken by state and Canadian
authonties. The data In the SV (Securities

In recent years the Commission
has
given Increased ernphasis to cooperation
and coordination
With other enforcement
agencies,
Including
the self-regulatory
orqaruzattons,
enforcement
agencies at
the state and local level, and certain foreign agencies. Its programs In thiS area
cover a broad range. For example, the
Commission believes that certain cases
are more appropriately
enforced at the
local rather than the Federal level where
the actrvrtres, while perhaps Violating the
Federal secunties laws, are essentially of
a local nature. In these Instances, the
Commission authorrzes the referral of the
case to the appropriate
state or local
agency, and members of the staff familiar
With It are made available for direct assistance to that agency in ItS enforcement
action. A member of the staff has been
specrfically desrqnated as a liaison with
state
enforcement
and
regulatory
autnonnes.
The Commission
has also fostered
programs designed to provide a comprehensive exchange of information concerning
mutual
enforcement
problems
and posstble securities Violations. DUring
the fiscal year, It continued ItS program

SWISS TREATY
As previously reported.'* the United
States and Switzerland signed a treaty
on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters
in May of 1973. The treaty ratified by the
lower house of the Swiss Parliment in
December, 1974, and by the upper house
in May of 1973. The treaty was ratified by
the lower house of the Swiss Parliment in
passed by the two houses are expected
to be resolved in the pariimentary session
starting in September, with consideration
by the United States anticipated shortly
thereafter.
The treaty should be of assistance to
the Commission where Swiss financial
institutions are utilized to engage in securities transactions in the United States,
or where funds resulting from illegal
acfivities are secreted in such institutions.
A representative of the Commission has
participated in the negotiations since they
began early in 1969.
il

FOREIGN RESTRICTED LIST
The Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign Restricted List which is
designed to put broker-dealers, financial
institutions, investors and others on notice of unlawful distributions of foreign
securities in the United States. The list
consists of names of foreign companies
whose securities the Commission has
reason to believe have recently been, or
are currently being offered for public sale
in the United States in violation of the
registration requirement of Section 5 of
the Securities Act of 1933. While most
broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities issued by companies
on the Foreign Restricted List, this does
not necessarily prevent promoters from
illegally offering such securities directly
to investors in the Unite'd States. During
the past fiscal year, the following corporations were added to the Foreign Re-

stricted List, bringing the total number
of corporations on the list to 84:
Finansbanken a l ~ . ~ ~ - T h i sis a bank in
Denmark subject to supervision by Danish
government bank regulatory authorities.
it has been advertising i n newspapers
and periodicals in the United States for
the purpose of publicly offering its savings accounts and its shares of stock to
United States investors. These advertisements offered 8 percent interest on savings accounts of depositors not owning
shares of stock of the bank and 10 percent intsrest to savings account depositors owlping shares of its stock. The
advertisements also offered 14 percent
interest on savings accounts not withdrawable except on 18 months notice, if
the depositor also purchases shares of
stock directly from the bank.
It has been judicially recognized that
the offer of a bank savings account constitutes the offer of a security as that
term is defined in the Securities Act.""
Although such accounts in United States
banks are exempt from Securities Act's
registration requirements. those of a
foreign bank are not exempt. Since neither the savings accounts nor the shares
of Finanebanken als are so registered,
the Commission has placed them on the
Foreign Restricted List.
Alan Mac Tavish, Lid.*'-This
English
corporation, has been advertising and
mailing solicitations to prospective investors in tne United States to induce them
to invest in Scotch malt whiskey in storage
in casks in warehouses in Scotland for
the purpose of aging the whiskey until it
becomes more valuable.
The Commission had previously obtained injunctions against similar offers
because the offers included services to
assist the investor in obtaining profits,
thereby constituting the offer of an investment contract that is a s e c ~ r i t y . ~
These decisions sustained the position
publicly announced by the Commission
on November 4, 1969.X:' that the distribution of ownership interests in whiskey in
this way ordinarily constitutes the offer
of a security required to be registered
under the Securities Act.
Since Alan Mac Tavish, Ltd. was fol-

lowing substantially the same procedures
in offering Scotch whiskey investments
and had not filed a Securities Act registration statement with the Commission
covering these securities, the Commission
placed Alan Mac Tavish, Ltd. on the
Foreign Restricted List.
Silver Stack Mines L t d . s e T h i s Canadian company has been engaged in gold
mining exploration in Quebec. I n May of
1974 it offered and sold in Canada
1,000,000 new shares of its common
stock at 60 cents per share. These shares
were in addition to the 1,500.000 shares
already outstanding. These shares were
listed and traded on the Montreal Stock
Exchange. Not long after the new shares
were issued, an investment adviser in the
United States began publishing a "Flash
Buy Recommendation" to purchase shares
of this stock, and investors in the United
States were found to be carrying more
than 200,000 shares of the stock in their
brokerage accounts at leading broker's
offices.
N o securities issued by Silver Stack
Mines. Ltd. had ever been registered with
the Commission under the provisions of
the Securities Act. Due to the shortness
of time following the issuance by the
corporation of the 1,000,000 new shares,
it appeared that the sales of shares to
investors in the United States constituted
a public offering of new shares that
should have been registered under the
Securities Act. Accordingly, the Commission placed Silver Stack Mines, Ltd. on
the Foreign Restricted List.

AND ACV:SEi2S 


Under the investment Company Act of
1940 and the lnvestment Advisers Act of
1940, the Commission is charged with
extensive regulatory and supervisory
responsibilitiesoverinvestmentcompanies
and investment advisers.The responsibility
for discharging these duties lies with the
Division of lnvestment Management
Regulation.
Unlike other Federal securities taws.
which emphasize disclosure, the lnvestment Company Act provides a regulatory
framework within which investment companies must operate. Among other things
the Act: (1) prohibits changes in the
nature of an investment comoanv's
. , business or its investment policies without
shareholder approval:
(2). protects
against
..
.
.
management self-dealing, embezzlement
or abuse of trust; (3) provides specific
controls to eliminate or mitigate inequitable capital structures; (4) requires that
an investment company disclose its financial condition and investment policies;
(5) provides that management contracts
be submitted to shareholders for approval and that provision be made for
the safekeeping of assets; and ( 6 ) sets
controls to protect against unfair transactions between an investment company
and its affiliates.
Persons advising others on their securities transactions for compensation must
register with the Commission under the
lnvestment Advisers Act. This requirement was extended by the investment
Company Amendments Act of 1970 to
include advisers to registered investment

companies. The Advisers Act, among
other things, prohibits performance fee
contracts which do not meet certain requirements, fraudulent, deceptive or
manipulative practices, and advertising
which does not comply with certain r e
strictions.
lnvestment companies and assets
under the management of investment
advisers constitute important resources
for investment in the nation's capital
markets. in order to continue their role of
channeling individual savings into capital
needed for industrial develd~ment,in;estment companies and investment advisers
must have the confidence of investors.
and the safeguards provided by the
Investment Company and lnvestment
Advisers Acts contribute to sustaining
such confidence.

NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS
As of June 30. 1975. there were 1,301
active investment companies registered
under the lnvestment Company Act, with
assets having an aggregate market value
of over $74 billion. Those figures represent an increase of 13 in the number of
registered companies and an increase of
nearly $12 billion in the market value of
assets since June 30. 1974. Further data
is presented in the statistical section of
this Report. At June 30, 1975, 3.420 investment advisers were registered with
the Commission, representing an increase
of 406 from a year before.
During the fiscal year, the Division's

staff conducted exarrunations of 244 investment companies and 404 Investment
advisers, 76 and 121, respectively, more
than dunng fiscal 1974. It IS the Commission's ultimate objective to examine all
Investment
company
registrants
within
the first year after reqistranon,
and to
examine
each
reqistered
Investment
company
and
registered
Investment
adviser every other year
This should
provide effective regulatory oversight. As
a result of the Commission's examination
and investigation
program In 1975, numerous violations of the Investment Company Act and of the Investment Advisers
Act were uncovered, and approximately
$4,248,976 was returned to Investment
companies and their shareholders.
Sixteen Investment
company
and twenty
Investment adviser matters were referred
to the Drvrsion of Enforcement for possible action

LEGISLATION
Securities Acts Amendments of
1975
A recent amendment of the Investment
Advisers
Act now requires
affirmative
Comrmssion action on an application for
registratIOn as an Investment adviser, instead of the prevrous procedure where a
registration
automatically
became effectrve thirty days after receipt by the Comrrnssron unless a proceeding
to deny
registration was recommended. This new
procedure conforms with that adopted for
broker-dealer
registratIOns
under
the
Exchange
Act, as amended.
Section
203(c)(2) of the Advisers Act now provides
that, within forty-five days from the date
of filing of an application for reqrstranon
(unless the applicant consents to a longer
penod),
the Commission
shall
either
grant registration
by order or institute
proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. The types of
crimes, conviction for which registration
may be denied or revoked under Section
203(e)(2), were expanded under the new
amendments. Section 204 was broadened
to give the Commission authority to prescnbe rules for the making and dissemination

at the average of the highest current
Independent bid and the lowest current
Independent offer for such security as
quoted on such quotation system, and
(2) at the time of such transaction, such
quotation system carries at least two
Independent current bids and offers furnished or submitted by at least two brokers or dealers with respect to such
security 2
In addition, an amendment was adopted
to the annual report form of all management investment
companies
requiring
registrants to describe all Rule 17a-7
transactions and to Identify the persons
involved and the nature of their affiliation
with the registrant. The amendment requires the registrant to state also the
reasons why It was appropriate for one
investment company to purchase securities which an affiliated Investment company wished to sell.

Temporary Rule 6c-2(T)
Proposed Rule 6c-2
In

February

1974,

the

and
Commission

adopted Temporary Rule 6c-2{T)
and
proposed for public comment a permanent measure, Rule 6c-2.1 to provide
corporations organized pursuant to the
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of
19714 ("Settlement
Act corporations")
blanket exemptive relief from a substantial number of provrsrons
of the Investment Company Act
The Settlement Act corporations, over
200 In number, were created to receive,
hold, and administer the land, minerai
rights and cash awarded by the United
States Government to Alaska's Native
Indian, Aleut and Eskimo population In
settlement of their abonprnal claims to
land In the State of Alaska. DUring the
first few years of the exrstence
of the
Settlement Act corporations,
only the
cash portion of the award has actually
been distributed to the companies, and
many of the Settlement Act companies
have Invested the cash in securities.
Hence, a substantial number of these
entities have become investment companies Within the meaning of the Act, and
to date thirty-five Settlement Act corporations have registered pursuant to Section
ala) of the Act and are covered by Rule
6c-2{T).'i
The staff analyzed the public comments
received on proposed Rule 6c-2 and
revised the proposal in accordance With
such comments and with views expressed
by other members of the staff and the
Commission Itself. After the close of the
fiscal year, such a revised rule was pubThe revised version
lished for comment."

Rule 6c-2(T), will remain In effect until
the Commission either adopts Rule 6c-2
or rescinds the temporary measure

Investment Company
Confirmation Requirements
In September 1974, the Commission
amended Ru Ie 15c1-4 under the Exchange Act to permit, subject to certain
conditions, the substitution
of quarterly
account statements for Immediate connrrnanons In connection with the purchase
of mutual fund shares Issued pursuant to
tax qualified individual pension plans or
any group plans 7 The adoption of this
rule amendment was significant In light
of the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which
reflects Congressional
efforts to reform
and extend pension benefits to retired
persons and which permits the use of
mutual funds as an Investment media for
certain tax qualified individual and group
pension plans
The relaxatron
of the
Exchange Act confirmation requirements
will help make It economically feasible
for mutual funds to be sold to such plans
In accordance with Congressional policy.
During the fiscal year, a number of
significant
rules were also proposed
under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 which were designed to Improve the
regulation of Investment advisers and to
respond to changes In the market place
brought about by the elimination of fixed
cornrrussion rates on securrtres transactions.

Brochure Rule
On March 5, 1975, the Commission
proposed
the adoption
of new Rule
206(4)-4 and new paragraph (14) of Rule
204-2(a) under the Investment Advisers
Act' The proposed rules are Intended to
assure that existrnq
and prospective
clients of an Investment adviser obtain
written disclosure of material rntormanon
which would enable such persons to
evaluate, among other things, the adviser's qualifications,
methods, services.
and fees They generally would require
that Investment advisers furnish a written
130

disclosure statement to every client and
prospective client (other than a registered
Investment company) upon entering Into,
extending or renewing an advrsory contract With such client and that copies of
each such disclosure statement be maintained by Investment advrsers as part of
their record keeping obligations under the
Advisers Act. The proposed written statement would Include, among other things,
a descripnon
of the types of services
offered, length of time the investment
adviser has been in such business, investment techniques, sources of information used, general standards of education
and business background
required
of
advisory personnel and the basis of fee
charges. There are addmonal disclosure
requirements
for
advisers
providinq
Investment supervisory services or managing Investment advisory accounts. As
of the end of the trscal year, the staff was
anatyzmq the comments received on thrs
proposal.

Investment Adviser RecordKeeping Requirements
In order to strengthen the protections
afforded by the Advisers Act to investment advisory clients, one amendment to
the record keeping rule was made and
another proposed. Rule 204-2 requires
Investment advisers to maintain
such
books and records as the Comrnrssron
may presence as necessary or appropriate
In the public Interest or for the protection
of Investors The record keeping requirements of Rule 204-2 serve as an Important
safeguard against fraudulent
securities
trading practices. Rule 204-2(a)(12) requires Investment advisers to maintain
records of secu ntres transactions for certain persons connected With the investment adviser.
In furtherance
of thrs
purpose, on February 21, 1975, the rule
was amended '. to Include a requirement
for the maintenance of such records for
affiliated persons of controlling persons
of Investment
advisers
and affiliated
persons of such affiliated
persons
In
addition, the rule was amended to provide
for a slrrular recordkeeping
requirement
for Investment advisers primarily engaged
In non-advisory
businesses

Rule 204-2(e) requires that books and
records be maintained and preserved "In
an easily accessible
place"
and that
partnership articles and corporate books
and records be maintained at the investment adviser's principal office. The Commrssron expressed doubt as to whether
certain places outside of the territorial
United States are "easily accessible,"
and, In order to tacuitate the inspection
of books and records as contemplated
by Section 204, on May 30, 1975, the
Commission announced that It was considering the adoption of new paragraph
(J) under Rule 204-2 under the Advisers
Act 10 The proposed rule would require a
non-resident
Investment adviser (1) to
maintain and preserve copies of the requrred
books and records at a place
within the United States and to file with
the Commission a written notice specifyIng such place, or (2) In lieu thereof, to
file with the Commission an undertaking
to furnish copies of such books and
records upon demand by the Commission.
The proposed rule IS substantially similar
to Rule 17a-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Regulatory Safeguards-- The
NASD Maximum Sales Load Rule

rights of accumulatron,
and (3) volume
discounts, as defined In the rule. A specific reduction
from the maximum IS
associated with the failure to provide
. each of the services. The proposed rule
also provides maximum sales loads rangIng from 8.50% down to 650% on sinqtepayment variable annurtres, and a maximum
of 8 50% of total payments as of a date
not later than the twelfth year after purchase for
multiple
payment
variable
annuity contracts
The rule was adopted by the NASD's
Board of Governors on January 28, 1975,
and subsequently approved by the NASD
membership, and was submitted to the
Commission for approval under Section
15A(J) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 on April 28, 1975. Subsequent to
that date, the Securities Act Amendments
of 1975 substituted the procedure provided
by Section 15A(J) with a new procedure
for Commission approval of rules promulgated by self-regulatory
organizations
under Section 19(b) of the 1934 Act.
Therefore, at year end, the staff had
requested that the NASD reflle the proposed rule In accordance with the new
procedure
Shortly
thereafter
It was
published for comrnent.u

APPLICATIONS
The 1970 Amendments to Section 22(b)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940
gave the NASD the authonty, with Comrmssron oversight, to promulgate and enforce rules preventing
sales charges
which are "excessive." Under the statute,
such sales charges must allow for "reasonable" compensation for sales personnel, broker-dealers, and underwriters and
for "reasonable" sales loads to Investors.
In 1972 the NASD submitted ItS proposed
"full service" maximum sales load rule to
the Commission As proposed, the rule,
which IS designed to prevent excessive
sales loads, taking Into account all relevant circumstances, permits mutual funds
or single payment contractual plans to
charge a maximum sales load of 8.50%
(declining to 6.25% for larger purchases),
but conditions the nght to charge the
maximum on the fund's offering (1) drvrdend reinvestment at net asset value, (2)

One of the Commission's
principal
actrvrties In the regulation of Investment
companies and Investment advisers IS
of applications
for
the consrderanon
exemptions from various provisions of
the Investment Company and Investment
Advisers Acts or for certain other relief
under these Acts. Applicants may also
seek determinations of the status of persons or companies DUring the fiscal year,
241 applrcatrons were filed under both
Acts, and final action was taken on 241
applications. As of the end of the year,
178 apptrcanons
were pending
under
both Acts Of the totals descnbed, the
predominant
number were appucanons
trled under the Investment Company Act
With respect to the Advisers Act, two applications were filed, final action was
taken on three and three were pending at
the end of the year.
131

Under Section 6(c) of the Investment
Company Act, the Commission, by order
upon application,
may exempt any person, security
or transaction
from any
provrsron of the Act, If and to the extent
such exemption is necessary or appropriate In the public Interest and consistent
with the protection of Investors and the
purposes fairly Intended by the policy
and provrsrons of the Act. Under Section
206A of the Advisers Act, the Commission
has Identical
authority
with regard to
provrsrons of that Act. Under Section 17
of the Investment Company Act, affiliates
of a registered Investment company cannot participate
In a JOint arrangement
with the registered company and cannot
sell to or purchase from the registered
company unless they first obtain an order
from the Commission
Many of the applrcattons filed with the Commission relate
to these sections.
Among the appucatrons
disposed of
during the fiscal year, the tollowinq were
of particular Interest.
The Commission Issued an opinion and
order under the Investment Company Act
allowinq the proposed merger of Christiana
Securities Company and E I du Pont de
Nemours and Company (Du Pont).12 As
previously reported, Christiana, a closedend Investment company with assets In
excess of $2.2 billion and the owner of 28
per cent of Du Pont's common stock had,
together with Du Pont, filed an application with respect to the merger proposal
since the affiliations of the parties would
preclude
such
a transaction
without
Commission
approval. The Commission
order, which was issued after an adrrurustrative hearing before a Judge and an
oral argument
before the Commission
In which certain objecting Du Pont shareholders participated,
permits the ISSUance of Du Pont common stock to the
Christiana common shareholders at 97 5
per cent of the net asset value of the
Christiana common stock, with Du Pont
the survrvinq corporation.
The Commission's oprruon In the matter
noted that "The Act's requrrernent that
the transaction
be reasonable, fair, and
free from overreaching,
does not mean
that the benefits to the parties must be
nicely balanced
Such a reading would
132

be wholly Impractical and would frustrate
legitimate
arrangements." 13 As of the
end of the fiscal year, the merger was
not yet consummated since the objecting
Du Pont shareholders
who had participated In the Commission proceeding have
filed an appeal of the Commission deersion which is pending before the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
circurt.«
In the past fiscal year, the complex of
eleven
Investment
companies,
which
were advised, distributed
and managed
by Wellington Management Company and
which have Identical boards of directors,
proposed to internalize
their corporate
administrative
functions
by capitalizing
and operating a service company to be
known as The Vanguard
Group,
Inc.
("Vanguard").
No officer or employee of
Vanguard could own any secunties
or
have any Interests In any external investment adviser or distributor. By organizing
such a wholly-owned,
Independent company, the funds, headed by Wellington
Fund, Inc., hoped to Increase their ability
to evaluate the performance of their advrser, distributor
and administrative
service agents. In addrtron, each fund hoped
to decrease ItS expenses, and pursuant
to a new advisory contract With Wellington
Management
Company
reflecting
the
proposed
change
In
responsibilities
whereby Wellington
Management
Company would serve solely as adviser and
distributor
of the funds, the funds expected to realize a reduction of $300,000
to $500,000 In their aggregate expenses
for the year.
Because of the attilratrons among the
eleven funds, an applicanon was filed by
Vanguard
and Wellington
Management
Company seeking a Commission order
pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Act and
Rule 17d-1 permitting the consummation
of such transactions
The Commission
thereafter
Issued such an order.!" On
May 1, 1975, after obtaining the approval
of the shareholders
of each fund, now
collectrvely known as the Vanguard Funds,
Vanguard began ItS operations.
anSubsequent
to the Cornrnisston
nouncement of ItS program to revise the
laws and regulations
affecting
mutual
fund drstnbutron, an applicatron was filed

by Putnam Investors Fund, Inc., and Its
pnncipal underwnter and by two Unit investment trusts and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc., their sponsor and
prrncrpal
underwnter.
The applicants
sought an order exempting them from
Section 22(d) of the Act which prohibits
an Investment company and Its principal
underwnter from seiling Its secuntres to
the publiC except at the current public
offering
pnce, Applicants
proposed to
offer, on a combmatron
baSIS, units of
the bond funds along With shares of
Putnam Investors Fund, Inc. The sales
charges for such combined unit represented a reduction from the sales charge
applicable to the securities when offered
separately. The Commission granted such
exemptton.is since the reduced charge
seemed to reflect reduced costs of drstnbution, and the standards of Section 6(c)
of the Act were satisfied. At the close of
the fiscal year, a Similar applrcatron was
pending.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
"Money Market" Funds
A recent mnovatron In the Investment
company Industry IS the so-called "money
market" fund, an Investment company
whose poucy IS to Invest prtrnanly In
short term debt securities (e.g., Treasury
bills, commercial
paper, certificates
of
deposit). Such funds seek to allow investors to take advantage of higher short
term rates earned on large Investments
by pooling their capital to permit the
purchase of larger denomination instruments than could normally be bought by
the average small Investor. These funds
have also attracted
Significant
investand non-profit
ments from corporations
institutions.
Money market funds have been one of
the fastest growing
segments of the
mutual fund Industry. At June 30, 1974,
only 10 money market funds, With total
assets of approximately $454 million, had
effective reqrstratron statements By June
3D, 1975, the number of money market
funds With effective registration
statements had grown to 38 As of that date
total money market fund assets had

climbed
to almost $3.8 billion
which
amounted to approximately
7% of the
assets of the mutual fund Industry
Money market funds, because of their
short term nature and the secuntres In
which they Invest, pose unique regulatory
questions. For example, these funds are
sold generally on the baSIS of "Yield", but
since they have not adhered to a uniform
method of valumq their assets or calculatIng their yields, It IS difficult to make
accurate Yield comparisons among them.
In connection
With this problem, the
Oornrnissron published for comment two
proposed guidelines 17 deSigned to standardize
valuation
of short-term
debt
securities and money market fund yield
quotations. At year end, comments on
these proposals were stili being received.

Sale of Participations in
Certificates of Deposit
A number of inquiries were received
dunng the year concerning the status of
publicly solicrted partrcrpatrons In large
denomination certificates of deposit and
In other money market Instruments which
offered relatively high Interest rates The
staff took the position that the offer and
sale to the public of partrcrpatrons In such
certificates Involves the offer and sale of
a separate secunty and that the Issuer of
may be an Investment
such securities
company which must register under the
Act, unless some specrtic exception or
exemption IS available.

Assignments of Investment
Advisory Contracts
Among the 1975 amendments, Section
15(f) of the Investment Company Act 18
permits an Investment adviser, or an
affiliated person of an adviser, to obtain
a profit In connection With a transaction
which results In an assignment of the
advisory contract
If certain conditions
are met. These conditions are desiqned
to prevent an Investment adviser or an
affiliate from receiving any payment or
other benefit In connection With the sale
of Its busmess which Includes any amount
reflecting ItS assurance that the Invest13a

ment advisory contract will be continued
Specifically,
It IS required that for the
succeeding three years at least 75% of the
board of directors of the Investment company not be comprised
of "interested
persons" of the Investment adviser or ItS
predecessor
and that the transaction
does not Impose an unfair burden on the
Investment company, such as an arrangement whereby an adviser or an Interested
person of an adviser IS entitled to receive
compensation from the company for brokerage, other than bona fide compensation as pnncrpal underwriter, or for other
than bona fide advisory or other services

Registration of foreign
investment companies
Foreign Investment companies, which
generally are prohibited from seiling their
secuntres
In this country, offer an opporpools of
tunity for Investing In drversmed
securities Issued by companies In foreign
countries
On December
2, 1974, the
Cornrrusston Issued a release I" prepared
by the Drvisron of Investment Management Regulation requesting public comments on whether
foreign
Investment
companies should be permitted to register
under the Investment Company Act and
allowed to sell their shares in this country
and, If so, under what conditions.
The
Issues raised In this release were consistent With a recent recommendation of the
Orqaruzatron for Economic Co-operation
and Development supported by representatives of the Cornrnrsston, that member
countries review their requtation of investment companies
and when
decrdrnq
whether to permit a foreign Investment
company to operate In their country, give
substantial weight to whether such company IS dorrucrled In a country which
complies With the OECD's rules on operanon of Investment companies
The Commrssion also sought comments on related
Issues, including whether such companies
could be allowed to register and sell
shares In this country Without sacnncmq
the high level of Investor
protection
embodied In the Act In response to the
release, the DIVISion received approxrmately fifty comments, including comments
134

from domestic
and foreign
Investment
companies, representatives of the United
States and foreign government agencies,
and United States Investors. The DIVISion
has reviewed these comments and Intends
to recommend to the Commission definitive action on this Issue In the next fiscal
year.

NASD Anti-Reciprocal

Rule

Recrprocal
sales practices, allocations
of portfolio brokerage busmess by mutual
funds to broker-dealers
as a reward for
their sales of fund shares, have been a
subject of Cornrmsston concern for more
than ten years. The reciprocal
use of
portfolio brokerage has been Viewed by
the Cornmrssron
as creating hidden influences
behind
recommendations
to
customers by retail sellers of fund shares,
rnducmq Improper portfolio management
practices and creating undesirable anticompetitive effects.2u In ItS Statement on
the Future Structure
of the Securtttes
Markets the Oornrnrssron announced that
reciprocal sales practices must be terminated, and, effective July 15, 1973, the
National ASSOCiation of Securities Dealers,
Inc. ("NASD") adopted a rule prohibiting
these arranqements.>'
During the prior fiscal year, the Commission announced that public hearings
would be held to consider
suggested
interpretatrons of and amendments to the
NASD Anti-Reciprocal
Rule.22 Prior to the
hearings, 42 letters of comment were
received, and at the hearings held on
September
10-12, 1974, 14 witnesses
appeared
Subsequently,
representatives
of the NASD indicated
that the NASD
would submit a revised proposal to meet
some of the objections
raised by the
Commission staff.
Under the proposal
as revised,
a
broker-dealer
would be prohibited from
demanding
or requinnq
any brokerage
or soucrtinq a promise of
commissions
such ccrnrnrssrons as a condition to the
sale of fund shares A pnncipal underwriter would be prohibited from offering
or promising any cornmrssrons to a brokerdealer for the sale of fund shares, but
would be permitted to request or arrange

for some (but not a specrfrc amount or
percentage of) brokerage to be paid to a
broker-dealer for the sale of fund shares.
The revrsions would specifically allow an
NASD member to sell fund shares or act
as a principal underwriter for an investment company which follows a policy,
described In ItS prospectus, of considerIng sales of ItS shares as a factor In the
selection of broker-dealers to execute Its
portfolio transactions, when such brokerdealers are qualified
to provide best
execution,
provided
that the member
of
compiles with the specific provrsions
the Rule and any published interpretation
of it. At the end of the fiscal year, the staff
was In the process of reviewing the NASD
proposal.

Two-Tier Real Estate Companies
A two-tier real estate company IS a
company which Invests In companies
which In turn Invest In real estate The
question of the applicability of the Investment Company Act to such companies
has arisen most often In connection with
limited
partnerships
which
Invest, as
limited partners, In limited partnerships
engaged In the real estate business
Under Section 3(a) of the Investment
Company Act, an Issuer IS an Investment
company If it IS, or holds Itself out as
being, engaged primarily in the business
of investing, reinvesting
or trading in
securities or If It IS engaged or proposes
to engage In the business of Investing,
reinvesting, owning, holding or trading In
secuntres, and owns or proposes to acquire Investment secunties having a value
exceeding 40% of the value of such Issuer's
total assets (exclusive
of government
secunties and cash Items) on an unconsolidated basts. Generally, an Issuer that
Invests In real estate can rely upon Section 3(c)(5) of the Act which excludes
from the denrutron of Investment company
persons purchasing or otherwise acquirrng
mortgages and other 'lens on and Interests
In real estate.
In August 1974, a release was Issued 23
setting forth the positron of the DIvision
with respect to the status under the Investment Company Act of two-tier real

estate companies The staff believes that
no action by the Commission IS warranted
If a two-tier real estate limited partnership
does not register under the Investment
Company Act, In reliance upon an opinion
of counsel, If certain cntena are satisfied.
These cntena relate to the primary bustness of the limited partnership, the nature
of the limited partnership's Investments,
the rrghts of the limited partners In the
partnership and the duties of the general
partner to the partnership
The staff further believes that certain
two-tier real estate limited partnerships
which do not qualify for the above "noactron"
positron may nevertheless, upon
application
to the Commission, be exempted from reqrstratron under the Investment Company Act, pursuant to Section
3(b)(2) or Section 6(c) of the Act, If (1)
the partnership IS, In fact, engaged In the
real estate business through control of
the underlying partnerships or (2) If the
partnership Invests In limited partnerships
engaged In the development and burldrnq
of housrnq for low and moderate Income
persons and certain requirements regardand fair dealing
Ing Investor surtabrlrty
by the general partner are satisfied

Variable Annuity Illustrations
The Commission adopted an amendment to the Statement of Policy under the
Securities Act of 1933,24 which permits
Investment companies ISSUing variable
annuity contracts to employ standardized
Illustrations based upon hypothetical Investment results in sales literature and
prospectuses. The amendment sets forth
standards
for permissible
illustrations
including (1) a presentation of effective
rates of return which should permit an
evaluation of aggregate costs (including
hidden charges), and (2) uniformity of
presentation to enable the Investor to
make accurate
comparisons
between
issuers of such contracts Thus the Illustrations serve as a valuable disclosure
meaningful cost infordevice provrdrnq
mation to Investors about a contract
which IS currently little understood They
which
could foster greater cornpetrtron,
should encourage a more rational pricing
135

system than presently exrsts In the sale
of variable annuity contracts.
Shortly
thereafter,
the
Commission
published for comment proposed amendments under the Securities Act of 19332;
which
would
require
prospectuses
of
variable
annuity separate
accounts
to
Include Illustrations
which are In accordance With the Statement of Poucy as
amended. At year end, comments on thrs
proposal were being consrdered by the
staff

Employee Retirement Income
Security Act
In connection With the Implementation
of the trducrary and disclosure provrsions
of the
Employee
Retirement
Income
Security Act of 1974,20 the Commission
offered the technical
assistance
of ItS
staff to the Department of Labor ("Labor")
and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
The Drvrsron was appointed as the Comrmsston's liaison with Labor and IRS. This
became an Important function, when In
early 1975, the Commission
was concerned that the Immediate effectiveness
of certain sections of the Act proscribing
certain types of transactions
would adversely
affect
the nation's
securities
markets. The staff of the DIVision offered
drafting and interpretive
assistance with
respect to these provisions of ERISA in
connection with the various applications
for exemption filed by members of the
securities industry In order to avoid such
adverse Impact.

Securities Depository System
DUring the past fiscal year, the DIVISion
studied the Impact of partrcrpatron In a
secuntres
depository by registered management companies
either
directly
or
through their custodians
Section 17(f) of
the Investment
Company
Act defines
"secuntres deposrtory"
as "a system for
the central handling of securities established by a national secunties exchange
regisor national secunnes associatron
tered With the Commission"
pursuant to
which securities are treated as fungible
and may be transferred
or pledged by
136

bookkeeping
entry without physical delivery of such securities. The Drvlsron's
study has Included VISitS to banks and
and the DIVISion
securities deposrtones,
IS presently
Involved In formulating
a
questionnaire which will be sent to interested persons In order to gain additional
mtormatron concerning whether rules may
be necessary or appropriate
In order to
Insure adequate
Investor protection
A
letter issued by the DIVISion took the
POSition that the Act did not preclude
partrcipatron In a depository by an investment company

PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANIES

Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Commission regulates
Interstate
public
utility
holding
company systems engaged In the electric
utility business and/or retail distribution
of gas. The Commission's
junsdrcnon
also covers natural gas pipeline companies and other non-utility
companies
which are subsidiary companies of registered holding companies. There are three
principal
areas of regulation under the
Act. (1) the physical integration of public
utility companies and tunctronally related
properties of holding company systems,
and the simplification
of Intercorporate
relationships
and financial structures of
such systems, (2) the financing operations
of registered holding companies and their
subsidiary
companies,
the acquisruon
and drsposrtron of securitres and properties and certain accounting
practices,
servicmp arrangements, and Intercompany
transactions,
(3) exemptive
provrsrons
relating to the status under the Act of
persons and companies, and provrsions
regulating the right of persons affiliated
with a publrc-utrlity company to become
affiliated
with another
such company
through acqursitron of secuntres.

COMPOSITION
At the end of calendar 1974, there were
22 holding companies registered under
the Act. There were 20 registered holding
companies within the 17 "active"
registered
holding-company
systems I The

remaining two registered
holding companies, which are relatively small, are not
Included among the "active" systems.' In
the 17 active systems, there were 71
electric
and/or gas utility Subsidiaries,
68 non-utility Subsidiaries, and 16 inactive
companies, or a total of 175 system comholding companies. Table 30 in Part 9
lists the active systems and their aggregate assets.

for hearing by the Associatron of Massachusetts Consumers, Inc ("Association")'
The Association has flied a petition for a
Writ of certioran "
In a related proceeding, the Commission sought enforcement of ItS order approving a plan for the retirement of the
minority stock Interest In Lawrence Gas
Company in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts.'
On September 15, 1975, the court entered
an order enforcing
the Commission's

to form a new holding company 'J
Union Electflc Company. III The court of
appeals affirmed without opinion II the
Commission's order granting Union Electnc Company, an exempt holding company, permission to acquire the common
stock of MIssouri Utilities Company.t> At
that time the Commission
declined to
order divestiture of the gas properties of
both companies, taking note of the adverse
developments In gas supply, and reserved
junsdrction to reexamine the retarnabilrty
of the gas properties
Amencen
Etectrtc
Power
Company,
tnc.' I The Commission heard oral argument on the application
of American
Electric Power, a registered holding company, to acquire by a tender offer the
stock of Columbus and Southern Ohio
Electric Company, a non associate electric
utility company. In light of problems encountered by the electric utility Industry
since the record In this proceeding was
closed In January 1972, the Commission,
by supplemental order.':' has requested
that all parties In Interest submit briefs In
response to questions specified In that
order.
Northeast

With the integration provrsions of section
11(b)(1)
In Northeast's Judgment, CNG and the
Town of Wallingford
were the highest
bidders for the gas properties, having
offered about 120-125% of the net book
value of the properties as of December
31, 1972, subject to adjustment. After the
close of the fiscal year, a hearing was
142

held and several parties appeared In opPOSition to the plan alleging, among other
things, that Northeast did not maintain
competitive conditions In soliciting
bids
and that the sale IS not In the Interest of
consumers. The matter IS pending

FINANCING
Volume
DUring fiscal 1975, a total of 15 active
registered holding company systems ISsued and sold 56 Issues of long-term debt
and capital stock aggregating $279 bilby the
lion pursuant to authonzatrons
Commission under Sections 6 and 7 of
the Act. Table 31 In Part 9 presents the
amount and types of secunnes
Issued
and sold by these holding
company
systems
The dollar volume of these tmancrnqs
represents an 11 percent Increase over
the previous year Bonds Issued and sold
decreased
24 percent,
and preferred
stock 11 percent
However, the amount
of common stock and debentures Issued
and sold Increased 148 percent and 78
percent, respectively

Financing of Fuel and
Gas Supplies
Due to curtailments
of fuel supplies,
etectnc and gas utilities have found It
rncreasmqly
necessary to finance substantial portions of their energy requirements by capital Investment In sources
of supply and transportation 2. DUring
ftscal 1975, approval was given to 8 reqistered systems to Invest In the aggregate
over $500 rrullron In these activrnes.

Competitive Bidding
The Cornrnlssion's Rule 50, adopted in
1941, requires
competitive
bidding
In
the sale of secunues by registered publrc
utility holding companies and their subsrdranes.> A temporary suspension of the
competitive bidding requirements of Rule
50 as applied to common stock of registered holding companies was authorrzed
from November 7, 1974, to March 31,
19752'1 Thrs action was taken because it
appeared to the Commission that, under
market condttions then prevailing, competitive bidding might not assure a sutncient number of potential
purchasers
143

given the volume of common stock Issues
that utilities
were offering
for sale. A
heanng
also was ordered
to develop
information as to whether the suspension
should be continued beyond March 31,
1975.
The Commission
did not extend the
temporary suspension beyond March 31,
1975, except that contemplated
sales of
common stock publicly
announced
by
January 31 could be sold without competitive bidding no later than April 30,
1975 30 Based upon the record developed
at the heanng and the expenence with
offerings of debt and equity securities of
utility companies, whether sold by negotiation
or competitive
bidding,
the
Commission
was persuaded
that common stocks of registered
holding companies again could be marketed In the
manner required by Rule 50. It also noted
that the exemptive provrsrons of the Rule
provide sufficient
flexibility
for Issuers
who encounter difficulties In seiling their
common stock by competitive bidding
Of the 56 Issues of long-term debt and
capital stock sold by registered systems
referred to above, 18 were sold by negounderwrinnqs
tiation.
The
negotiated
totaled about $1.2 billion and consisted
of one bond offenng,31 3 preferred stock .12
and 14 common stock 11 Issues
Nine
of the common stock offenngs were sold
dunng the penod of the temporary suspension The remaining nine Issues were
sold pursuant to exceptions from the Rule
granted by order. Table 32 In Part 9 sets
forth statistical data with respect to all
of these Issues

PART 7
CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS

The Commission's
role under Chapter
X of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides
a procedure for reorganizing corporations
In the United States district courts, differs
from that under the various other statutes
wtuch It administers
The Commission
does not initiate Chapter X proceedings
or hold its own hearings, and It has no
authority to determine any of the Issues
In such proceedings
The Commission
participates In proceedings under Chapter X to provide
Independent,
expert
assistance to the courts, participants, and
Investors In a hIghly complex area of
corporate law and finance. It pays special
attention to the interests of public secunty holders who may not otherwise be
represented effectIvely.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of
a debtor corporation exceeds $3 rrullron,
Section 172 of Chapter X requires the
judge,
before approving
any plan of
reorganization,
to submit it to the Comrnrssron for its examination
and report.
If the Indebtedness does not exceed $3
million, the Judge may, If he deems It
advrsaole to do so, submit the plan to
the Cornrmssron before decrdmq whether
to approve It. When the Commission files
a report, copies of summaries must be
sent to all security holders and creditors
when they are asked to vote on the plan
The Commission has no authority to veto
a plan of reorganization
or to require
ItS adoption.
The Commission has not considered it
necessary or appropriate to participate In
every Chapter X case Apart from the ex-

cessive administrative
burden, many of
the cases Involve only trade or bank
creditors and few public Investors. The
Commission
seeks to participate
prtncipally In those proceedings in which a
substantrat
public
Investor
Interest
IS
Involved. However, the Commission may
also participate
because an unfair plan
has been or IS about to be proposed,
public security holders are not represented
adequately, the reorganization
proceedIngs are being conducted In Violation of
Important provisrons of the Act, the facts
rndicate that the Cornrrussron can perform
a useful service, or the Judge requests
the Commission's participation.
The Oornrmssron in its Chapter X activrtres has divrded the country Into five
geographical
areas
The
New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle regional
offices of the Commission
each have
rasponslbttity for one of these areas
Supervision
and review of the regional
offices' Chapter X work IS the responsibility
of the Drvrsron of Corporate
Regulation
of the Commission,
wtuch,
through
ItS Branch of Reorganization,
also serves as a field office for the
southeastern area of the United States.

CHAPTER X RULES
The Advisory commutee
on Rules of
Practrce and Procedure of the Judicial
Conference of the United States proposed
new Chapter X Rules. The Commission,
In response to a general lnvitanon for
comment,
submitted
a comprehensive
149

report generally entreat of many aspects
of the proposed Rules. In the Cornrrussron's view the Rules repeatedly abolrshed,
without
comment,
carefully
devised
Congressional
safeguards
for
public Investors Also, the Rules do not
adequately reflect the differences between
procedures needed to bring about the
reorganization
of an enterpnse
under
Chapter X In order that It may continue
as a gOing-concern
and procedures
necessary to accomplish
liquidation
In
ordinary bankruptcy proceedings.
comAs a result of the Oornrmssron's
ments, substantial changes were made
and some rules were deleted or redrafted. Thereafter the Chapter X Rules
and ottrcial forms were submitted to the
Supreme Court which by order dated
Apnl 28, 1975, transmitted the Rules and
Forms to Congress pursuant to Section
2075, Title 28, United States Code
The Cornrrussron continued to disagree
With a number of proposed rules and
submitted a memorandum to Congress
objecting to four proposed rules. They
are: Rule 1~01
dealing With stay of
actions against debtors and lien enforcement; Rules 10-117 and 10-308(a), dealIng With the transfer of a Chapter X
proceeding to Chapter XI and conversely,
and Rule 10-215(c)(4), dealing With secunty transactrons
by nducranes
The
Cornrrusston opposed these rules because
they made substantial changes In exrstIng law With little or no explanation and
If adopted, would Impair the effective
adrnrrustratron of Chapter X. The Rules
became effective Without amendment on
August 1, 1975.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES
In fiscal year 1975, the Commrsstcn
entered 14 new Chapter X proceedings
mvolvrnq
companies
With
aggregate
stated assets of approximately $657 million and aggregate Indebtedness of approximately $686 million. Including the
new proceedings, the Comrrussron was a
party 10 a total of 129 reorqaruzatron
proceedings dunnq the fiscal year I The
stated assets of the companies Involved
In these proceedings
totaled approxr150

mately $3.8 billion and their indebtedness
about $3.4 billion.
DUring the fiscal year, 9 proceedings
were closed, leavmq 120 In which the
Commission was a party at fiscal-year
end

ADMINISTRATIVE

MAnERS

In Chapter X proceedings, the Commission seeks to protect the procedural
and
substantive
safeguards
afforded
parties In such proceedings. The Commission also attempts to secure judrcral
uniformity In the construction of Chapter
X and the procedures thereunder.
Kmg Resources
compenv» The Commrssron supported the trustee In urging
atnrmatron
of the distnct court's ruling
which rejected a claim by unsecured
senior creditor
banks for post-petrtron
Interest from funds which would otherwise have been available to holders of
subordinated
debentures
under terms
of the subordmatron agreements.
Since the debtor was found Insolvent,
the case was governed by the general
rule that Interest on unsecured claims
ceases to accrue as of the date the petition IS filed 3 Therefore, to establish the
nght of sernor creditors to post-petition
Interest,
the subordination
agreement
must unambiguously show that the general rule was Intended to be suspended 4
Since no reference to payment of postpetition Interest was contained In the
subordination
agreements,
the senior
creditors presumably have no nght to
poet-pennon Interest The matter was stili
pending as of the close of the fiscal year
Investors Fundmg Corporetton of New

TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION
AND STATEMENTS
A complete accounting for the stewardShip of corporate
affairs by the prior
management IS a reqursite under Chapter
X. One of the primary duties of the trustee
is to make a thorough study of the debtor
to assure the discovery and collection of
all assets of the estate, rncludmq claims
against officers, directors, or controlling
persons who may have mismanaged the
debtor's affairs The staff of the Commission often aids the trustee 10 his investrgatlon.
Famngton Manufacturing

et, J.l-As a result of facts uncovered durIng the course of rus extensive lnvestrqa151

non of the debtors, the trustee brought a
plenary action In the federal court In New
York to recover for Famngton Manufactunng Company ("Manufactunng")
about
$800,000 In profits allegedly made by a
retired officer and director
who sold
shares while In possession of matenal
adverse mtorrnatron which was not publicly disclosed or was disclosed In a
misleading manner The court held that
the complaint stated a cause of action
under Delaware law for common law
breach of a director's fiduciary duty to a
corporation to refrain from making personal profit through the use of inside
corporate information, but that the trustee
had no standing to sue under Section
10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act,
since neither he nor the corporation was
a defrauded purchaser or setler.':'
The reorganization judge dismissed the
trustee and directed the successor trustee
to petition the New York court to transfer
the case to the Eastern Distnct of Virginia
"for hearing and determination."
Subsequently, upon JOint motion of the successor trustee and the defendant, the
complaint was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal
Rules of CIVil Procedure I>
In his report, the trustee concluded
that, inter alia, the offermg circular used
In connection with the offer and sale of
$10,000,000 In Euro-dollar
debentures
Issued by Farrington Overseas Corporation ("Overseas"), guaranteed by Manufacturing, contained false statements of
matenal facts and failed to disclose other
matenal
rntormatron. Based upon the
mtorrnatron developed dunng the Investigation, a debenture holder filed an action
rn the federal court rn New York on behalf of Itself and other ongmal purchasers
agamst the accountants, underwriters and
officers and directors of Overseas and
Manufactunng alleging violations of Section 17(a) of the Secuntles Act of 1933
and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Commission's
rules
promulgated
thereunder.!"

cause he had all of the documentary
evidence and Overseas had causes of
action against the defendants based on
the same facts
The reorganization judge ordered the
trustee "to torthwrth pennon the New
York court for leave to withdraw as party
plaintiff .. " In an accompanYing memorandum, the judge stated that"
.. [the
trustee and his counsel) worked up the
SUit, developed the evidence and drafted
the complaint and forwarded It to New
York for fllmg."
Upon learnmg of tms
memorandum
opinion
and order, the
judge iiI ths New York action requested
the parties to address themselves to the
Issue of " vhether It IS a coltusrve action."
The Commission was prepared to argue
emtcus curiae that such an action is not
coltusrve
merely because the Chapter X
trustee shares the trurts of his rnvestiqanon with a party to the reorganization
proceeding. Ttus argument became unnecessary when the judge ruled at the
outset of the hearing that the Euro-dollar
debenture holder could remain as a party
plaintiff. The purpose of a trustee's investigation IS to enable him to convey to
the court and all parties In Interest the
information he has discovered. The Supreme Court, while holding a Chapter X
trustee did not have standmg to assert a
claim on behalf of debenture holders,
stated that public mvestors "would be
able to take advantage of any information
obtained by the trustee In reorganization
as a result of the investigation which the
statute requires that he make." 17 For a
court to hold that a trustee cannot share
facts uncovered during ms investigation
with a representative
of a class that
allegedly has been Injured would erode

Subsequent to the withdrawal of the
Overseas' trustee as a party, the drstnct
court ordered the dismissal of the debenture holders' action for lack of subjectmatter junsdrction after finding that the
purchase was "predominantly
foreign"
and that the antifraud provrsrons of the
Federal secunties
laws were not intended to apply to such a purchase.!" The
court further found that the debenture

About four
months after the appointment
of the
Chapter X trustee, the court approved,
over
the Commission's
objection,
a
$150,000 cash settlement of the lawsurt
in exchange for general releases from
the defendants,
because
the trustee
needed the cash to operate the business
The trustee had had little or no time to
conduct the required investigation of the
debtor's attarrs or possible causes of action that existed against former management. The Commission urged that the
investigation be made so that the trustee
could present facts from which an informed Judgment could be reached on the
overall merits of the settlement. In the
Commission's
view the cash was not
significant In light of the debtor's overall
needs to warrant relinquishing
possible
claims.
About six months after the settlement
was approved, the trustee ceased operations and announced his intention to
propose a plan of orderly lrqurdatron. At
the close of the fiscal year, neither a plan
nor the report of the trustee's investigation had been filed.

PLANS OF REORGANIZATION
Generally, the Cornrrussron files a formal advisory report only in a case which
Involves substantial public Investor interest and presents Significant problems.
When no such formal report IS filed, the
Comrnrssron may state ItS views briefly by
letter, or autnorrze ItS counsel to make
an oral or written presentation
DUring

no formal advisory repo~t, but ItS views

conclusron
of plan hearings the court
found the debtor Insolvent and referred
an Internal plan of reorqaruzanon proposed by the trustee and a plan of orderly
lrqurdanon
proposed by a major creditor
to the Commission for ItS report. The
trustee's plan provided for, among other
things, the Issuance of stock to creditors
and
warrants
to shareholders
The
trustee's plan appeared teasrble, but the
Commission was unable to determine
whether It was "fair and equitable" because of the Inadequacy of the record.
In ItS report, the Commission objected to
the proposed Issuance of warrants,23
pointed out that the warrants and underlying secunties, If Issued, would not be
exempt from the registration provrsrons of
the Securities Act, recommended a more
Simplified capital structure for the reorganized company than the one proposed,24 and urged that provrsions for
the Issuance of non-voting stock which
Violate Section 216(12)(a) be deleted. The
Commission also advised the court that

the court had not rendered a decrsion
regarding approval of either plan.

were proposed for thrs West VirgInia industrial
savings and loan business which, through
seven offices, had about $30 million In
uninsured deposits and $6.8 rmllron In
subordinated debentures to over 20,000
persons.
Three plans were fIled by outside
proponents and provided for either the
purchase of the debtor's assets or an
acqursmon of the company which contemplated the connnuatron of the debtor's
busrness The trustee proposed an internal plan calling for the debtor's reentry Into the industrial loan busrness but
Without accepting savings deposits. Under
the trustee's plan creditors would receive
cash and securities of the reorganized
company
The trustee proposed a form of consolrdatron which treated the parent cor153

poration separately from Its subsidianes.
The subsidranes'
assets would be pooled
and all creditors
of these subsidianes
including
depositors
would be treated
as equally entitled to the pooled assets
As a result, the parent estate was sepagiven to
rately valued with recoqrntron
claims totaling almost
the subsrdranes'
$6 million, which represent advances to
the parent.w The court as urged by the
Commission adopted thrs form of consolidation
Holders of the debtor's common stock
would be excluded from participation under all plans In accordance
With the
court's
finding
of Insolvency,
whether
treated separately or combined With ItS
subsrdranes
Lrkewise the subordinated
debenture holders, due to their subordination, were accorded no participation
as such In the trustee's plan The plan
provides that to the extent that debenture
holders can establish claims based on
alleged Violations of the Federal securrtres
laws, they Will participate on a panty With
depositors as unsecured creditors
The Commission
suggested that the
trustee's proposed claim procedure for
subordinated
debenture holders provrdIng for a separate determination of each
claim be consolidated for trral on a class
action basis and that a lead counsel be
appointed
Shortly thereafter a class action was filed on behalf of the debenture

In ItS onqinal memorandum, the Comrrussron found the three outside plans
either unfair and/or unfeasible and concluded that the trustee's plan was fair,
equitable and teasible but indicated that
the creditors would receive more In value
If the estates were liquidated. The bankruptcy judge acting as special master
agreed With the Commission and recommended that the trustee amend hrs plan
of
to provide for the orderly lrqurdatron
the estate The estate was valued at about
$23 million on a gOing-concern baSIS and
about $32 million
under
an orderly

Thereafter
the trustee amended his
plan to provide for the orderly liquidation

and treatment of debentures

outside proponent amended rns previous
plan to provide more consrderatron
to the
creditors In light of the $32 million uqurdanon value. The Commission's
supplemental memorandum concluded that the
orderly liqurdatron was fair to creditors
but stili found the creditor's
plan to be
unfair Amendments necessary to make
the proponent's plan fair havmq not been
made, the court approved the trustee's

Investors
Corp 27_ The debtor was engaged in the
busmess of buyrnq and seiling Interests
In vanous types of real estate ApprOXImately 1,700 publiC Investors purchased
about $11 million of promissory notes,
secured by tractional
Interests in real
estate mortgages and contracts
The trustee's
mvestrqatron
disclosed
that the selection of secunty for the particular Investors was made In a fortuitous
manner by the debtor subsequent to payment by the Investor Thus, he concluded
that the actual value of the secunty assigned to Investors vaned greatly. The
trustee therefore
proposed an Internal
plan of reorganization embodying a compromise
among
the public
creditors.
Under the plan each Investor would receive a non-Interest
bearing debenture
In the principal amount equal to 50 percent of the secunty he holds In addition,
the Investor would receive common stock
of the reorganized company In exchange
for the remaining portion of hrs claim,
including the other 50 percent of the value
of the claimed secunty Unsecured creditors would receive the balance of the
common stock except that up to 50 percent of the stock may be retained for
Issuance to new management The plan
excludes the two present stockholders
from participation
since the debtor was
Insolvent.
In ItS report the Commission pointed
out that while compromises are "a normal part of the process of reorqaruzanon," 2" the court has a duty to scrutinize

the merits of the proposed compromise
and apply Its informed Independent judgment.29 Thus, since further hearings on
objection to the compromise were scheduled which could result In evidence that
would controvert the trustee's findings,
the Commission did not take a position
with respect to the fairness of the compromise and urged the court to hear the
objecnons
before approving
the compromise.
The plan was defrcient In leaving for
future determinations the maturity date of
the debentures and provisrons
for payments Into the sinking fund,3o thus preventing the Commission from analyzing
the feasibility and fairness of the trustee's
plan.
The Commission also objected to the
reservation of common stock for compensation to new management, noting that
the Supreme Court has held that because
certain persons can provide management,
for
Without more, "IS no legal [usntrcanon
the Issuance of stock to them" under a
Chapter X reorqaruzation 31 The Commission pointed out that stock cornpensanon
for new management IS a matter more
appropriate for consideration by the new
board of directors of the reorganized
company.
In accordance With the Oomrrusston's
View, the court IS conducting further hearrnqs on the fairness of the compromise.
As of the end of the fiscal year the court
had not approved the plan.

motions; because of the lapse of time

The hearing on the application
was

end of the fiscal year, had not been heard.
The debtor's proposed arrangement contemplates that new management would
take over the operation of the business
Should It be confirmed, the appointment
of a receiver would become moot.

lot purchasers
who had the right to

Liabilities
aggregated
about
$34.5 million, of which almost $16 million

that creditors,

lot purchasers

their contracts
and investors, would be paid in full over a period
of years from a trust fund created from
remaining land sales contracts receivable
plus 10% of future land sales contracts.
The Commission moved to Intervene In
the Interest of public Investors, since It
believed that the proposed arrangement
raised a number of questions under the

-Shortly
after the commencement
of
these Chapter XI proceedings, the New
York Stock Exchange advised the debtor
of Its decrslon to file an application with
the Commission
to dehst the debtor's
common stock and convertible subordinated debentures.
Upon appllcatron
of
the debtor, the bankruptcy judge, holdIng that the stock exchange listing constitutes "property" of the debtor and thus
within the JUrisdiction of the bankruptcy
court, entered an order enjoining
the
Exchange from making such application
The Exchange appealed to the distnct
court The Commission filed an smtcus
curtee brief urging that the order of the
bankruptcy JUdge be reversed because of
lack of [urrsdrcnon to grant the injunctive
relief sought against the Exchange. The
baSIS for the Commission's posrtion was
that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
embodies
a comprehensive
statutory
scheme whereby national securities exchanges registered with the Commission
are placed under ItS regulatory control,
and that Section 12(d) of that Act vests
exclusive jurrsdictron over the exchange
delisting process In the Commission, subject to judrcral review of Oornrnlssion orders only by Federal courts of appeal.
The Commission did not address itself to
whether exchange listing IS "property"
of the debtor because of ItS belief that,
even assuming arguendo that It IS propjunsdrcnon
erty, a bankruptcy
court's
over stock exchange listings IS preempted
In
by the grant of exclusive [unsdrctron
Section 12 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. At the end of the fiscal year

SEC MANAGEMENT
OPERATIONS

A number of Important developments
occurred In 1975, contributing to Increased
Improved service to
operating etncrency,
the publrc, and ettective use of the Comrrussion's resources.

ORGAN~AnONALCHANGES
One major
change
was aimed
at
strengthening
the Commrssron's
capacity
for economic
research
and ensuring
critical
support
to the new National
Market
Advisory
Board. Towards
this
end, the Commission
has grouped
ItS
Offices of Econornrc Research and Policy
Planning under a Directorate of Economic
and Polley Research. The new urut IS
responsible for, among other things, collecting and processing
reports on the
holdings and trading of institutional
investors called for by the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1975 and Improving the
Comrrussrcn's
ability to develop timely
and accurate data on the capital markets,
In order to Identify fundamental changes
affecting
the
markets
and
to
help
formulate
Cornmrssron polley reflecting
awareness of such changes. It IS expected that the consoudanon
of uruts
under a Single offrce will enable the Commrssion to better define problems and
collect
the empirical
evidence needed
to regulate effectively
the various components of the securities
Industry for
which It IS responsible.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal
year, the Office of RegistratIons and Re-

ports and the Otnce of Records were
merged to form a new Oftrce of Reports
and Information Services, ("ORIS")
The
encompass
new Offrce's responstbrlrtres
a/l of the duties of the two former offices,
includrnq the receipt, initial examrnatron,
drstribunon and storage of all the Commission's otncral frlrnqs: the control of
Commission records and correspondence;
the management
of the Cornrnrssron's
public reference services; the coordination of responses to Investor inquiries
and complaints, the substantive examination of certain reports and applications,
and the maintenance of numerous computer records In addttion, ORIS assumed
for Implementing
primary responstbihty
the provisrons of the amended Freedom
of tntorrnatron Act (FOIA), and the Privacy
Act of 1974, as they relate to rnatenal
tiled WIth the Cornrnrsaron FOIA requests
were formerly handled by the Office of
PubliC Intorrnatron. Due to the Increase In
the number of requests and new demands
created by the Privacy Act of 1974, the
Comrmssron
decreed to centralize
all
operations
In these areas In ORIS. A
special section has been set up Within
ORIS to coordinate
the processing
of
these requests.

INFORMATION

HANDLING

Significant progress was made durinq
the year to Improve the SEC's information
processing capabihnes.
In recoqruzrnq the need for an orderly
167

extension of ItS use of advanced technology, the Commission, with the assistance of consulting
support
services.
completed
an agency-wide
information
systems review. As a result of this review, the Commission initiated the preparation of five-year plan for developing
more comprehensive information processIng systems and enhancing
ItS overall
computer support capability. In addmon,
the Office of Data Processing,
having
determined
that an Immediate requirement existed for drastically
Improving
the method by which computer-based
information
IS processed, explored the
feasibility
of utilizing
telecommurucanons 1 for accessing and maintaining the
Commission's
mtorrnatron systems. This
exploration
process
consisted
of the
introduction,
on a very limited and experimental basts, of telecommunications
equiprnent and techniques to two of the
Cornrrussron'a
most widely
utilized
information systems, and the preparation
and cornpletron
of a feasibility
study
report This report sets forth recommended
to
courses of action for the Comrrusston
follow In proceeding with the expansion
and further development of telecommunications for Internal Information processing
The recommendations
are clearly consistent with the short-term phases of the
atorernennoned
five-year
plan that IS
being developed
The Office of Data Processing also expended a coasrderable
amount of time
In modifying and Improving many of ItS
existrnq information systems and the manner In which rntorrnauon IS processed
These rnodrtrcations
and Improvements
were made possible by the additional
equipment Installed In the latter part of
fiscal year 1974,2 and resulted In a substantial Increase In the number and timeliness of Jobs processed
through
the
computer
A most Important new system was developed durrnq the year Ttus system was
desiqned to facilitate
the Comrnrssron's
morutonnq of negotiated cornrrussron rates
and the Impact that such rates Will have
on the securities Industry
In the area of new legislation, the Office
of Data Processing was and continues to
168

be heavrly Involved In the torrnulatron of
Commission
policy and procedures,
as
they relate to automated Information systems, to carry-out the provrsrons of the
Freedom of Information Act Amendments
and the Privacy Act
In addrtron, preliminary work was cam eo-out dunnq the
latter part of the year to determine what
computer and analytical
support would
be required In meeting the provrsrons of
the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975.

CONSUMER

SERVICES

The Cornmtsston took several Important
steps In the development
of a comprehensrve consumer
education
program
The program IS Intended to result In the
creation of written matenals and audioVisual aids that Will enhance effective
communication
between the Commission
and the various constituencies It serves.
The first product of thrs program was
the production,
In conjunction
with a
prominent
orqaruzatron
for continuing
color
legal education,
of a 3D-minute
sound film of an actual Comrrussron meetIng. It IS believed to be the first such
record of an actual meeting by an independent regulatory agency. The film was
developed for, and has been shown to,
educational and legal organizations
who
wish to have a better understanding
of
how the Cornrmsston approaches, formulates and resolves problems tacinq It
On a more fundamental level, producnon was completed of a tz-mmute narrated color slide program entitled "Eagle
on the Street". Thrs program was deSigned to provide lay audiences With a
baSIC understanding of why the Oomrrussion was created, how It IS structured and
operates, what ItS rmssron IS, and how It
can be of assistance to the general public This program has been well received
by a number of educational and professional organizations. Plans are underway
to develop a broad drstribuuon to ensure
the program's availability to any Interested
groups
Finally, the Cornmtsston has undertaken
to write, publish and distribute a series
of consumer education booklets The first
such booklet, "Investigate
Before You

Invest",
was distributed
In connection
with the Consumer Information
Center.
More than 10,000 copies of the booklet
were requested
by and distributed
to
members of the public. A second booklet,
"The SEC and the FOIA", was designed
to provide answers to basic questions
concerning the Commission's administration of the Freedom of Information Act
It is available at the Commission's home,
regional and branch offices Other educatronal publications
are currently in production and are expected to be completed
and distributed
dUring the upcoming
fiscal year.
A new consumer brochure, "How To
Avoid Ponzi and Pyramid Schemes", has
been prepared and IS In the process of
being printed It cautions Investors about
these schemes and suggests some ways
of
recognizing
them.
ThiS brochure
should be ready for distribution
In early

1976.

ACTIVITY UNDER FREEDOM OF
INFORMATION ACT
Amendments
to the Freedom of Intorrnanon Act were enacted Into law on
December 19, 1974. From an operations
standpoint, the Commission had to qurckly
adjust ItS procedures and reassign manpower to cope with the flow of FOIA requests and the records administration
problems that accompany such requests
The Commission on February 19, 1975,
revised ItS own Freedom of Information
rules to conform to the December 1974
amendments
These revrsrons provide that the public
can Inspect or obtain copies of all records
maintained by the SEC with the exception
of certain
specmed
categories
of information.
Most financial
and other inIorrnatron filed by registered companies
has always been available for mspection
or copying by the public
However, the
public was denied access to certain categOries of material, notably investigatory
records
Pursuant to various FOIA requests, during thrs fiscal year, the Comrrussron has made available for pubuc
inspection many records Which had traditionally
been considered
confidential

Among these records are portions of the
Broker-Dealer
and the entire [nvestment
Advrsers
and Investment
Company Inspection Manuals, the Summary of Administrative
Interpretations
under
the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Commission's penodrc Securities Vrolatrons Bulletin
Moreover,
the Commission
has
made available,
pursuant to particular
FOIA requests, staff letters of comment
on registration statements or other filings
and Wells Committee submissions
Between February 19, 1975, when the
Commission revised ItS rules, and June
30, 1975, the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission
received 267 requests for
information pursuant to the FOIA

PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT

Recruitment
With only a small Increase In staff, the
Commission
did not pursue its normal
vigorous
on-campus
recrurtmq
efforts,
although It did continue active efforts to
recruit secretarial and clerical employees.
For protessionat
POSitions, the comrrnssion received an overwhelming
number
of applications from extremely well qualified candidates for the vacancies that did
occur. The competition for all protessronal
Jobs has been extremely keen and the
credentials of the candidates outstanding.
Success of the Commission's
Equal
Employment Opportunity
affirmative
actron program was most evident In Its
attorney staffing. At the close of the fiscal
year, minority attorney employment stood
at 33, up from 11 two years earlier, and
female attorney employment reached 55,
up from 24 at the end of fiscal year 1973
The CIVil Service Commission
completed ItS nationwide review and rnspec169

non of the Commission's personnel management program with a VISit to the
Headquarters Offices during October and
November 1974 Their written evaluation
report had not been received by the end
of the fiscal year
The Commission's
Internal personnel
management
evaluation
program
was
revised and updated In October 1974 In
accordance
with new civrl service requrrements As an Intergral part of that
program, the Office of Personnel also
initiated a quarterly management reportIng system, with statistical
summaries
of personnel activities In each unit being
sent to the Regional Administrators
and
the Directors of the operating drvrsion
and larger support offices

Training and Development
With the addition of a tun-tune Employee Development Specialist to ItS staff,
the Commission was able to expand ItS
training and development activities dunnq
FY 1975.
The TUItIOn Support Program, under
which employees who enroll In college
degree programs receive tumon assistance
for courses which relate to the Commission's work, was expanded, as were
counselling services for employees takIng courses under the program. The
Career Opportunities
Program, a basic
skills program, graduated nine employees
who were ready to move Into typist pOSInons. By the end of the year, four employees had already
been placed
In
positions offering them greater career
advancement and opportunities
to use
their new skills.
A 12-hour Personnel Procedure Class
was inauqerated to Introduce supervisors
and managers to Commission
policies
and procedures as they pertain to personnel management This class will be
expanded next year Into a 40-hour basic
supervrsron class.
The emphasis on onsrte technical staff
training continued this year Under a contract with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, SIX accounting
courses were offered at the Headquarters
Office for SEC accountants and persons
170

In related fields. The Regional Offices
continued to offer 3-5 day seminars on
enforcement and regulatory matters for
their staffs and for those of Federal, State
and local law-enforcement
agencies In
their areas An Integrated comprehensive
training program for securrnes compliance
examiners was instituted with developmental training programs for both SEC
examiners and the examiners of the selfregulatory
organizations;
the program
Includes self-study and periodic seminars
In regional offices. Seminars on investment company and Investment adviser
matters were held In two regional offices
and In the Headquarters. Training gUides
were developed for the staff during the
past year covering the taking of testimony
In investigative proceedings and sanctions
In SEC administrative proceedings.
An Executive
Development
program
was developed and Implemented to provide executive development training for
employees at grades GS-16 and above
and managerial training for employees at
GS-14 and GS-15
Executives (GS-16
and above) are expected to attend one
executive development course per year
Managers and their supervisors are expected to prepare Individual Development
Plans to Identify the on-the-Job and formal
training they need for performance on
their assigned position and to maintain
an overall high level of management
expertise
throughout
the Commission.
Funds also have been set aside for GS-14
and GS-15 employees who wish to apply
to receive additional training to develop
managerial skills

OFFICE SPACE
The Office of Administrative
Services
provided assiStance to the Los Angeles,
Chicago and Atlanta Regional Offices and
to the Houston and Philadelphia Branch
Offices In gaining larger quarters, either
through relocation or expansion of existIng facilities
Some progress was made In Improving
the Commission's presently unsatisfactory
space arrangement In Washington, where
Commission staff are scattered In three
different locations and many offices are

severely overcrowded.
Both houses of
Congress authorized the General Services
Administration
to obtain a new headquarters
location for the Commission,
but GSA's choice of an unsatisfactory
site resulted In a time-consuming appeal
to the Office of Management and Budget.
At the close of the year It appeared likely
that the Commission
had successfulty
contested the selection of this proposed
siqht, but a decrsion as to an acceptable
alternative appeared to be some months
away.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Altogether, fees collected by the Comrrussion In fiscal 1975 amounted to 54
percent of funds appropriated
by the
Congress for Commission operations. The
Commission IS required by law to collect
of securities ISfees for (1) reqrstratron
sued; (2) qualification of trust rdentures,
(3) registration of exchanges; (4) registration of brokers and dealers who are
registered with the Commission but are
not members of the NASD; and (5) certincanon
of documents
filed with the
Commission. In addition, by fee schedule,
the Commission imposes fees for certain
filings and services such as the filing of
annual reports and proxy material

With reference to the fee schedule, on
March 29, 1974, the Commission
announced the repeal of certain provisrons
of Rule 203-3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which required each
Investment adviser to pay an annual fee
to the Commission during the period of
The Commission subseItS reqrstratron
quently announced, In Release IA-486,
that all fees affected would be refunded
to those advisers and former advisers
who paid them In any of the years In
which the fee was Imposed. The action
was taken following the Commission's
consideration of recent decisions of the
United States Supreme Court J with respect to the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952, 31 U.S C. 483(a),
which was thought to provide the statutory
baSISfor establishing these fees

Assets and Liabilities
Broker-dealers reported total assets of
$25.2 billion at year-end 1974, as compared with $25.9 billion at year-end 1973.
This three percent decline occurred as
all but four asset components fell to levels
below that for 1973. Of the four components that showed an increase, one,
receivables
from broker-dealers,
registered an Increase primarily because of
accounting
practice
changes and the
addition of new business activities. The
decrease witnessed In the other asset
components may be explained primarily
by the decrease In the number of firms
reporting.
Total
liabilities,
not including
subordinated borrowings,
declined by one
percent between 1973 and 1974 to approximately $21 billion. As was the case
with assets, most liability
components
registered
declines,
reflecting
the decrease In the number of firms reporting.
The notable exceptions to the general
pattern of liability decline were money
borrowed, the Industry's largest single
liability
component,
which
Increased
slightly to $10 7 billion, and payables to
other
broker-dealers,
which
reflects
changes
In accounting
practices
and
busmess activities.
Total capital aggregated $4.2 billion

at year-end 1974 compared With $47
billion at year-end 1973, a decline of 10
borrowrnqs
for
percent
Subordinated
capital
purposes-s-wtnch
include
subordinated
loans, accounts covered by
equity or subordination agreements and
by 14
secured demand notes-e-dechned
percent to $1.1 billion. Equity capital
declined by eight percent to $3.1 billion.

Broker-Dealers,
Employees

Branch Office,

The number of broker-dealers Increased
In 1974, ending a series of successive declines beginning In 1970 Although the
number
of
broker-dealers
Increased
slightly, the number of branch offices
operated by broker-dealers continued ItS
downward movement In 1974.
The number of broker-dealer employees
Increased between 1970 and 1971 and
again between 1971 and 1972. The trend
since 1972, however, has been downward
With the number of employees for 1974
being five percent below the 1972 peak
The number of registered representatives declined by five thousand between
1973 and 1974 Registered representatives, however, stili accounted for 60
percent of the Industry's total number of
employees.

SECO Broker-Dealers
The number of broker-dealers who are
not members of a registered national secunties association Increased from 300 to
302 during the past fiscal year. This was
the second consecutive year In which the
number of SEeO broker-dealers Increased
by a small number despite an overall
contraction In the size of the total brokerdealer firm community. This Increase is

attributable
primarily
to the" continued
registration
as broker-dealers
of specialty firms, such as firms seiling real
estate-related
securities,
which
attain
fewer competitive advantages in Joining
the NASD than do traditional
brokerdealers. On the other hand, a substantial
decrease in the number of condominium
and put and call broker-dealers
was
noted. (See attached Table).

Real Estate Investment Trusts

1974, there were 75 condominiums

regiswith the Commission
valued at
$7133 rrulhon. Since that time, registered
offenngs In condominium
projects have
declined sharply.
The REIT paper contains an analysts
of the REITs and discusses management
organization,
compensation
plans and
Secuntles Act registrations
Since 1968,
REITs have become a large source of
construction loans Statistics compiled In
the report indicate that REIT Industry
assets total about $21.2 billion
In contrast, Industry assets were Just $4.7 billion as of year-end 1970. Recently, however, a large segment of the Industry
shows a leveling off In asset growth, with
any Increases In loanable funds pnrnanly
coming from sources other than secuntres
tered

Dunng the fiscal year, the Office of
Economic Research published three economic staff papers covenng real estate
Investment trusts (REITs), condominiums
registered
under the Securities
Act of
1934 and the Cost of Flotation of Registered Issues, 1971-1972.
Early In the fiscal year, the staff conducted
an analysis
of condominiums
registered under the 1933 Secuntres Act
Trus report IS believed to be the most
complete statistical profile of condominium
reqrstrattons assembled to date. It contains a concise analysis of management
organization
and compensation,
with a
listing of all registrations
studied
According to the figures compiled In the
paper, In the penod from 1967 to June,

Cost of Flotation of Registered
Issues, 1971-1972
This report examines Initial costs of
flotation of all effectively registered debt
offered for Immediand equity secuntres
ate cash sale dUring the period 19711972. It covers Issues offered to the general public by corporate-Issuers
(primary
offerings) and those being sold by existIng shareholders
(secondary
offerings)
which encompass Issues offered through
securities dealers, Issues offered directly
by the ISSUing corporation as well as ISsues offered through privileged subscnpnon, The five most prevalent types of
secuntres
covered are common stock,
preferred
stock, limited partnership
inand convertible
terests, nonconvertrble
debentures.
Costs covered by the analysis are those
strictly associated with transmitting funds
from the investor to the Issuer. There are
two major categories of costs covered
compensation paid to secuntres
dealers,
finders or agents for the services they
registered seprovide In merchandising
cunties offerings; and "other expenses"
associated with the preparation
and ISsuance of new securities;
e.g., legal,
accounting and engineering fees, Securities and Exchange Commission registration
fees,
printing
and
engraving
expenses etc. Noncash compensation
In
the form of warrants or option IS covered
to a slightly greater extent than has been
the case In the past.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table below reflects, the securities laws provide for a wide range of
enforcement actions by the Commission
The most common types of actions are
injunctive proceedings instituted In the
Federal district
courts to enjorn
con-

trnued or threatened secuntres
law violators, and administrative
proceedings
pertaining to broker-dealer firms and/or
individuals
associated with such firms
which may lead to various remedial sanenons as required In the public interest.
When an injunction is entered by a court,
violation of the court's decree IS a oasis
for criminal contempt action against the
violator.

Altogether, fees collected by the Comrrussron In fiscal 1975 amounted to 54

(3) registration of exchanges, (4) reqistranon of brokers and dealers who are registered with the CommisSion but are not
members of the NASD, and (5) certification of documents filed with the Commrssion
In addition,
by fee schedule, the
Oornrrussion Imposes fees for certain ttlinqs and services such as the filing of

of pending

With reference to the fee schedule, on
March 29, 1974, the Commission
announced the repeal of certain provisions
of Rule 203-3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which required each
Investment adviser to pay an annual fee
to the Commission during the period of
ItS registration.
The Cornrrusston
subsequently announced,
In Release 1A-486,
that all fees affected would be refunded
to those advisers and former advisers who
paid them In any of the years In which the
fee was imposed. The acnon was taken
following the Commission's consideration
of recent decisions of the United States
Supreme Court With respect to the Independent Offices Appropriation
Act of
1952,31 USC 483(a), which was thought
to
provide
the
statutory
baSIS for
establishing these fees.
