MS & Co. was registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer beginning in 1980 and as
an investment adviser in April 2009. It was owned by Smith (50%), McGinn (50%; 30%
after 2004), and Thomas Livingston (20% after 2004). From 2003 to 2009, MS & Co. had
about 55 employees, including about 35 registered representatives. On December 24,
2009, MS & Co. filed a partial BD-W. On March 9, 2010, MS & Co. also withdrew its
investment adviser registration. FINRA terminated MS & Co.’s FINRA membership on

OVERVIEW

20.
Respondents Anthony, Chiappone, Feldmann, Gamello, Lex, Livingston,
Mayer, Rabinovich and Rogers were among the top-selling brokers at MS & Co. They
sold millions of dollars of MS & Co. private placements in spite of numerous red flags,
including a policy−which was clearly inconsistent with the terms of the offerings−that
required them to “replace” customers seeking to redeem notes with new customers before
the redemption would be honored. Guzzetti, a supervisor at MS & Co., failed to take any
action despite knowledge of red flags. Based on their conduct, Respondents committed the
following violations:
a) Anthony, Chiappone, Feldmann, Gamello, Lex, Livingston, Mayer,
Rabinovich and Rogers willfully violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the
Securities Act by offering and selling notes for which no registration
statements were in effect;
b) Anthony, Chiappone, Feldmann, Gamello, Lex, Livingston, Mayer,
Rabinovich and Rogers willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities
Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
by knowingly or recklessly, or negligently, failing to perform reasonable
due diligence to form a reasonable basis for their recommendations to
customers, and made misrepresentations and omissions in
recommending the Four Funds and Trust Offerings; and
c) Guzzetti failed reasonably to supervise the other Respondents, pursuant
to Section 15(b)(6), incorporating by reference Section 15(b)(4)(E) of
the Exchange Act.
D.

THE MS & CO. OFFERINGS

21.
David Smith and Timothy McGinn created and controlled the Four Funds
and Trust Offerings. The offerings raised more than $125 million from more than 750
investors. Investor losses exceed $80 million.
22.
The Four Funds offerings−FIIN (Sept. 2003), FEIN (Jan. 2004), TAIN
(Nov. 2004) and FAIN (Oct. 2005) –raised at least $85 million. Smith controlled the
5

issuers, prepared the private placement memoranda (“PPMs”), set the terms of the
offerings, controlled the investor money, and made all the investment decisions. Four
Funds investors were promised quarterly interest payments and a return of principal upon
maturity. Each offering had three tranches: the five-year “secured junior” notes paid
10.25%; the three or five year “secured senior subordinated” paid 7.5% or 7.75%; and the
one-year “secured senior” notes paid 5%, 5.75% or 6%.
23.
Although the Four Funds PPMs labeled each tranche as “secured,” there
were no secured assets subject to forfeiture in the event that a particular Fund failed.
24.
According to the PPMs, MS & Co., as the placement agent, was to receive a
commission of 2% of the offering proceeds. In addition, according to the PPMs, the
brokers were entitled to (and did receive) “incentive commissions . . . [paid] to our
managing member’s salesmen at the rate of 2% of the aggregate principal amount of the
notes per year over the term of the notes.”
25.
Smith had no experience in making investment decisions and managing
investments for entities like the Four Funds, and Smith had broad flexibility in making
investment decisions. As the PPMs for the offerings stated, each of the Four Funds was:
formed to identify and acquire various public and/or private
investments, which may include, without limitation, debt
securities, collateralized debt obligations, bonds, equity
securities, trust preferred, collateralized stock, convertible
stock, bridge loans, leases, mortgages, equipment leases,
securitized cash flow instruments, and any other investments
that may add value to our portfolio . . . .
26.
The PPMs stated that the notes would be offered only to accredited
investors, as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D. To this end, the PPMs required that
each investor “represent in writing that it qualifies as an ‘accredited investor’ . . . and must
demonstrate the basis for such qualification.” The subscription agreements similarly
reiterated that the notes were offered to accredited investors only.
27.
Despite these representations, each of the Four Funds offerings had more
than 35 unaccredited investors. The Respondents sold the Four Funds to unaccredited
investors.
28.
In September 2003, just weeks after the launch of the FIIN offering, Smith
began diverting millions of dollars to pay investors in pre-2003 MS & Co. offerings. 2

2

From 1990 through early 2003, Smith and McGinn orchestrated, through MS & Co. and
related entities, dozens of note offerings secured by residential alarm contracts.

6

Overall, Smith used at least $12.8 million of the Four Funds offering proceeds to pay
investors in pre-2003 MS & Co. offerings.
29.
Smith invested a majority of the Four Funds’ proceeds in entities that were
affiliated with MS & Co., even though the PPM did not disclose this, and in risky and
highly speculative venture capital investments. For example, Smith invested $8.8 million
in alseT Management, a start-up partially-owned and controlled by Livingston and Smith
himself, which never earned any revenue. The Four Funds’ investments did not generate
sufficient returns required to meet the issuers’ obligations to investors.
30.
In 2006, McGinn returned to MS & Co. on a full-time basis after nearly
three years as CEO of IASG. McGinn created the twenty-one Trust Offerings, plus MSTF,
that raised over $41 million. The Trust Offerings ostensibly were created to fund entities
engaged in specific areas, such as burglar alarm service, triple play service, or luxury
cruises. These entities, however, were not funded directly by the issuer; instead, in most
cases, the offering proceeds were first transferred to various conduit entities, primarily
McGinn Smith Funding LLC (the “MSF Conduit”) or TDM Cable Funding LLC (the
“TDM Conduit”).
31.
The proceeds of the Trust Offerings were commingled and then used as
needed by MS & Co., including infusing cash into the faltering Four Funds. The conduits
and their corresponding Trust Offerings are listed below:
TDM Conduit

TDM Verifier Trust 08, 8.5%/10% (12/17/2007)
TDM Verifier Trust 09, 10% (12/15/2008)

32.
The Trust PPMs stated that they would “generally be offered only to
accredited investors,” but also provided for 35 or fewer unaccredited investors, supposedly
under Rule 506. None of the Trust Offerings exceeded 35 unaccredited investors. When
integrated according to their Conduit entity, however, Rule 506’s limitation on
unaccredited investors was breached: at least 69 investors in the Trusts tied to the TDM
Conduit were unaccredited, and at least 59 investors in the Trusts linked to the MSF
Conduit were unaccredited.

7

33.
The Trust Offerings continued the egregious misuse of investor funds.
Smith and McGinn, for example, took for personal use millions of dollars in offering
proceeds from the TDM Cable 06, TDMM Cable, Integrated Excellence, MSTF and
Fortress offerings, used investor funds to pay earlier noteholders, and used the Trust
Offering proceeds to satisfy liquidity needs for other MS & Co. entities.
E. THE RESPONDENTS’ ILLEGAL CONDUCT
34.
The Respondents, as associated persons of a broker-dealer, had an
obligation to conduct a reasonable investigation of the issuers in order to form a reasonable
basis for any recommendation to customers regarding the MS & Co. offerings. By making
a recommendation, the Respondents implicitly represented to their customers that they had
an adequate basis for the recommendation. A broker has a duty to investigate the truth of
the representations he makes to customers, because, by virtue of his title, customers are
entitled to presume that the representations made were the result of reasonable
investigation.
35.
The Respondents blindly relied upon Smith and McGinn, even in the face of
red flags. The Respondents, as licensed securities professionals, knew or should have
known that securities issued by smaller companies of recent origin require more thorough
investigation. They should not simply parrot the marketing information furnished by Smith
and McGinn, particularly in the face of red flags. In addition, where Respondents lacked
essential information about an issuer or its securities when making a recommendation, they
failed to disclose this fact as well as the risks that arose from their lack of information.
36.
The Respondents’ due diligence, which at best consisted of reading the
PPMs, was wholly inadequate, despite their knowledge that the issuers were completely
controlled by Smith and McGinn. There were numerous red flags, moreover, that should
have alerted the Respondents to the need for a thorough investigation. Instead, the
Respondents blindly sold whatever private placement Smith and McGinn told them to sell.
37.
The Respondents also made material misrepresentations and omissions
when recommending the Four Funds and Trust Offerings to their customers.
The Respondents Knew of Red Flags
Surrounding the Four Funds Offerings.
38.
Anthony, Chiappone, Feldmann, Gamello, Lex, Livingston, Mayer,
Rabinovich and Rogers performed inadequate due diligence prior to recommending the
Four Funds to their customers. The PPMs for the Four Funds, which they read or were
reckless in not reading, made disclosures that should have caused the Respondents, as
associated persons of a broker-dealer, to conduct a searching inquiry prior to
recommending the products to their customers. This heightened duty arose from the
following factors:
a. The PPMs made clear that Smith owned and controlled each of the
issuers−which were new, single-purpose entities with no operating history−
as well as the placement agent (MS & Co.) and the trustee. Smith also had

8

total control over the disposition of investor funds, with absolutely no
oversight or control. As a result, the Respondents should have made
specific inquiries as to how customer money would be invested before
recommending the Four Funds to their customers.
b. The Respondents knew or should have known that Smith had never before
managed offerings of the size and scope of the Four Funds. The debt
offerings that MS & Co. had done before 2003 were small-scale note
offerings tied to the income streams from home alarm contracts, far
different from the broad and non-specific investment mandate of Four
Funds offerings. 3 Given Smith’s lack of experience in this area, and the
Respondents’ knowledge of this lack of experience, they should have made
specific inquiries as to how Smith planned to invest the offering proceeds.
This is particularly true given fact that the issuers’ ability to make the
relatively high interest payments, and to return the investors’ principal,
depended on the nature of the investments;
c. The PPMs stated that the Four Funds could acquire investments “from our
managing member [MS Advisors] or any affiliate,” could “purchase
securities from issuers in offerings for which [MS & Co.] is acting as
underwriter or placement agent,” and that “[a]ffiliates of the placement
agent may purchase a portion of the notes offered hereby.” As a result, the
Respondents should have inquired whether Smith−who controlled without
oversight the issuers, the placement agent and the disposition of investor
funds−did engage in any transactions with affiliates. If they had, they
would have discovered that nearly half of the offering proceeds had been
invested in affiliates; and
d. Despite the complete prohibition on sales to unaccredited investors in the
Four Funds PPMs, the Respondents knew that sales were being made to
unaccredited investors. The Respondents, therefore, knew that the PPMs’
prohibition on sales to unaccredited investors was disregarded, which
should have caused them to make inquiries.

3

The Respondents, when recommending the Four Funds and Trust Offerings, held out
the pre-2003 alarm note offerings as indicative of Smith and McGinn’s integrity and skill.
These earlier offerings, however, were also mismanaged. In a handwritten letter from
Smith to McGinn in 2000, Smith characterized the pre-2003 offerings as a “Ponzi
Scheme” because the offering proceeds “for the most part are used to fulfill the
investment promise to earlier investors . . . the new investments have no chance of being
repaid in full.” These offerings were eventually paid off not from the income stream
generated by the investments, but rather through the IASG IPO in July 2003, as well as
over $12 million from the Four Funds offerings.

9

39.
These factors should have prompted the Respondents to conduct a searching
inquiry into the offerings. Instead, they essentially turned a blind eye and sold the Four
Funds offerings with no specific knowledge of how investor funds were being used.
Smith’s Refusal to Disclose to the Brokers How He Had Invested
Four Funds Offering Proceeds Was a Red Flag.
40.
From the commencement of the FIIN offering in September 2003 until
January 2008, Smith provided his brokers with no specific information about how he had
invested the offering proceeds. Any questions by the brokers were deflected with the claim
that Smith had made loans to local Albany businesses with Four Funds proceeds, and those
businesses desired anonymity. Indeed, Smith steadfastly refused to give the brokers any
meaningful information about how he had invested the Four Funds offering proceeds. This
refusal should have prompted the brokers to further question the propriety of the Four
Funds.
41.
The information blackout that Smith imposed was contrary to the PPMs,
which stated that an “annual statement of the operations consisting of a balance sheet and
income statement” would be provided to investors upon request. These reports, however,
were never made available and it appears that no brokers requested this information before
January 2008, when Smith disclosed that the Four Funds would be restructured.
42.
MS & Co.’s compliance manual, moreover, stated that “it will make a
reasonable investigation . . . [and] Paperwork recording the due diligence will be kept in the
legal files.” The Respondents also never asked to see the due diligence files,
notwithstanding the red flags regarding the Four Funds.
The Respondents Continued to Recommend MS & Co. Offerings
Despite Knowledge of the Redemption Policy – Another Major
Red Flag.
43.
By 2006, the Funds began having significant difficulty in meeting the
redemption requests. Smith therefore instituted a policy that required brokers to “replace”
customers seeking to redeem Four Funds notes, including maturing notes, with new
customers (the “Redemption Policy”). The PPMs, however, did not state that a customer’s
right to redemption depended on finding a “replacement.”
44.
The Redemption Policy was another red flag that put the Respondents on
notice that the Four Funds were being handled much differently from what the PPMs
provided. None of the Respondents, however, undertook any investigation of the offerings;
they also failed to disclose this material information to their customers; and they continued
to recommend MS & Co. private placements to their customers for several more years.
45.
The Respondents learned of the policy at different times beginning in late
2006. They were shocked by the policy and knew that it was contrary to the PPMs. The
Respondents, however, did not disclose the Redemption Policy to customers, even those
who sought to reinvest, or “roll over,” Four Funds notes at maturity. Collectively, the
Respondents raised millions of dollars in MS & Co. private placements after learning of the

10

policy. They stood to profit if a customer elected to roll over, and would receive their
annual commission for the life of the note. The Respondents sought redemptions for
current customers even knowing that the redemption would be paid not with investment
returns, as the PPMs represented, but rather with new investor funds.
The Respondents Continued to Sell the Trust Offerings Despite
Learning in January 2008 that the Four Funds Had Been
Mismanaged.
46.
On January 8, 2008, Smith and McGinn held an all-day meeting to inform
the brokers, including the Respondents, that the Four Funds were in default, that payments
to investors would be curtailed, and that the offerings would be restructured. Smith
revealed that the Four Funds investment portfolios consisted of loans to small, local
businesses, some of which had already filed for bankruptcy; risky venture capital
investments; investments with sub-prime exposure; and other nonperforming investments.
By contrast, the Four Funds each had made only one investment in a publicly-traded
security: Exchange Boulevard.com, a risky venture capital company that was quoted on
OTC Link, formerly known as the Pink Sheets.
47.
None of the Respondents, despite the alarming disclosures in this meeting,
requested any kind of probing investigation into what happened to the Four Funds or the
ongoing Trust Offerings. After the January 2008 meeting, there were thirteen offerings by
MSTF and the Trusts, which raised at least $20 million. As a result of the accumulation of
red flags since the launch of the Four Funds in September 2003, the Respondents should
have conducted a searching inquiry regarding any MS & Co. private placement. Instead,
they recommended the Trust Offerings to their customers based on insufficient due
diligence.
48.
During the three years of the Trust and MSTF Offerings, investor funds
were being used in ways contrary to the uses described in the PPMs; for example, Smith
and McGinn took at least $4 million in offering proceeds for themselves and another MS &
Co. officer. Offering proceeds also were used to pay investors in earlier offerings and MS
& Co.’s payroll.
49.
In the Trust Offerings, the amount actually invested pursuant to a particular
PPM was far less than that PPM disclosed.
50.
The Trust PPMs, moreover, like the Four Funds PPMs, raised red flags that
should have been readily apparent to the brokers. For example, the August 2009 TDMM
Benchmark Trust 09 (“Benchmark”) PPM should have raised a red flag. Benchmark
promised a high rate of return, which ranged from 8% to 12%, during a time when the
prime rate was only 3.25%. The Respondents should have been skeptical of Benchmark’s
ability to meet the promised interest payments especially when considering that the PPM
disclosed that only $1,950,000 (approximately 65%) of the total $3 million raised would
actually be invested, with the remainder siphoned off in fees. The Respondents who
recommended the Benchmark offering did so despite the exorbitant fees, and without
questioning how MS & Co. planned to make 8 – 12% interest payments and redeem the
principal upon maturity while taking over one-third of the money raised in fees.

51.
The second Firstline Trust offering of October 19, 2007 raised $3.2 million
from investors (an earlier Firstline offering in May 2007 had raised $3.7 million). In this
offering, a McGinn Smith affiliate loaned the offering proceeds to Firstline Securities, Inc.,
a Utah corporation that sold residential alarm contracts. At the time of the October 2007
offering, McGinn had been informed of the threat of crippling litigation by one of
Firstline’s creditors, and McGinn was personally involved in trying to resolve the dispute.
Litigation resulted and, on January 25, 2008, Firstline filed a voluntary petition for Chapter
11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah. If the Respondents
had conducted due diligence in response to red flags, they would have discovered the legal
issues, which should have caused them to stop selling the Firstline offering. Instead, they
were unaware of the bankruptcy filing until McGinn finally disclosed it in September 2009.
Lex, Feldmann, Chiappone, Rabinovich and Mayer sold Firstline trust certificates after the
bankruptcy filing.

GUZZETTI FAILED REASONABLY TO SUPERVISE

61.
Guzzetti was the managing director of the MS & Co. Private Client Group
from 2004 until late 2009. During this period, Guzzetti supervised MS & Co. registered
representatives with regard to the Four Funds and Trust Offerings.
62.
Guzzetti, who also earned about $6,000 in commissions, had direct
supervisory responsibilities of the Respondents. He carried out numerous managerial
duties, including recruiting and hiring MS & Co. employees; assigning and reassigning
customers to brokers; evaluating employee performances and awarding commissions;
addressing customer grievances; answering employee questions regarding the firm; and
issuing instruction and guidance regarding specific financial products and transactions,
administrative issues, and broader firm policy.
63.
Guzzetti also sent regular e-mails summarizing MS & Co. products
available for sale to customers. In a February 2006 email, for example, Guzzetti stated that
“there are many investors sitting in money market accounts (fear of higher interest rates)
who are losing return (cost of waiting). Our FAIN’S offer a way of locking in higher
returns with $ sitting in money markets waiting for the ‘top’ in interest rates.”
64.
Guzzetti learned of the Redemption Policy by December 2006, when he
received an email from Smith stating that Rabinovich “needs to replace the $100,000
before doing the trade. I am running on fumes with all of these redemptions and cannot
afford any[]more.” In November 2007, Guzzetti received an email from Smith stating that
“I do not have the liquidity. Any redemptions have to have replacement sales beforehand. .
. . My preference is for there to be no redemptions.” Guzzetti instructed the brokers to
adhere to the Redemption Policy.
65.
Guzzetti had a duty to investigate red flags that suggest misconduct may be
occurring and to take action when made aware of suspicious conduct. Had Guzzetti
responded reasonably to the red flags, he would have prevented or detected the underlying
violations committed by Anthony, Chiappone, Feldmann, Gamello, Lex, Livingston,
Mayer, Rabinovich and Rogers.
