In the Matter of
GARY L. MCDUFF

OPINION AND ORDER OF THE COMMISSION DENYING INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW
Petition filed:
Last brief received:

April 25, 2016
May 9, 2016

Gary L. McDuff seeks interlocutory review of pre-hearing decisions that the law judge
made concerning the scope of a hearing and the evidence to be admitted in follow-on
proceedings against him based on a federal district court order that enjoined him from future
violations of certain registration, antifraud, and broker-dealer provisions of the federal securities
laws.
The law judge previously granted a Division of Enforcement’s motion for summary
disposition in this matter and imposed a collateral bar.1 McDuff appealed, and the Commission
reversed, finding that the law judge had erred in applying preclusive effect to a civil complaint
on which McDuff defaulted and a superseding indictment on which a jury returned a general jury
verdict.2 The Commission remanded the matter to the law judge for further consideration of two
issues: (1) whether McDuff was acting as a broker or dealer at the time of his misconduct and, if
so, (2) whether imposing sanctions against him is in the public interest. The law judge has
scheduled a hearing for June 14 and 15, 2016.
As explained below, McDuff’s petition for interlocutory review is denied. The
Commission may at any time review an interlocutory ruling on any issue, whether on its own
initiative or at a party’s urging, even absent certification by a law judge. However, the issues
raised by McDuff’s petition are not appropriate for Commission review at this time, and we
therefore deny his motion.

Facts and Procedural Background
The Commission instituted this follow-on proceeding on February 21, 2014, alleging that
McDuff had been permanently enjoined by a United States district court from future violations of
Securities Act Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a);3 Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a);4 and
Exchange Act Rule 10b-5.5 The injunction was entered after the Commission filed a civil
complaint on March 26, 2008, alleging that McDuff participated in a wide-ranging scheme to
defraud investors.6 After McDuff failed to answer the complaint, the district court granted the
Commission’s motion for default judgment, enjoined McDuff from further violations of the
federal securities laws, and ordered him to disgorge $136,336 plus $65,004 in prejudgment
interest and pay a civil penalty of $125,000.7 McDuff did not appeal the district court’s orders.
McDuff was indicted on August 13, 2009 and charged with laundering monetary
instruments and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.8 McDuff was found guilty on both counts
pursuant to a general jury verdict. On April 16, 2014, the district court sentenced McDuff to 300
months in prison and a three-year term of supervised release and ordered him to pay $6,563,179
in restitution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed McDuff’s conviction and
sentence on February 3, 2016.9
McDuff and the Division both moved for summary disposition. The law judge denied
McDuff’s motion and granted the Division’s motion. The law judge found that there was no
genuine issue of material fact that the Division had met the two statutory prerequisites for
imposing remedial sanctions under Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)—namely that the district
court’s entry of a default judgment against McDuff established that he had been acting as a
broker-dealer at the time of his misconduct and that McDuff did not dispute that he had been
enjoined from engaging in conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.10 The

See 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(6) (authorizing the Commission to determine whether a sanction is

associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, was associated or was seeking to become
associated with a broker or dealer, and (ii) the respondent has been enjoined from engaging in or
continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the purchase or sale of any security); see

law judge then determined that a collateral bar was in the public interest based on the allegations
in the civil complaint and superseding indictment.
McDuff appealed, and the Commission found that the law judge had erred in granting
summary disposition. The Commission explained that, in the case of a default judgment,
collateral estoppel “does not apply with respect to any issue in a subsequent action” and
therefore the default judgment did not provide an adequate basis for finding that McDuff acted as
an unregistered broker-dealer or determining that a collateral bar was in the public interest.11
The Commission similarly held that the public interest determination could not be based on
allegations in the superseding indictment. As the Commission explained, a jury convicted
McDuff of money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a general verdict without
making a specific finding as to which, if any, of the alleged overt acts McDuff committed with
respect to the wire fraud.12 The jury’s general verdict that McDuff had committed money
laundering established only that McDuff caused the transfer of illegal proceeds with the intent to
promote wire fraud.13 The Commission therefore reversed and remanded the matter to the law
judge for further proceedings to determine whether McDuff was acting as a broker or dealer at
the time of his misconduct and, if so, to admit and consider additional evidence to determine
whether imposing sanctions against McDuff is in the public interest.
On remand, McDuff and the Division again both filed motions for summary disposition.
The law judge denied the motions and ruled that the matter would proceed to a hearing. During
a February 18, 2016, prehearing conference, the law judge stated that there was “really only one
question” that he needed to address, which was “whether or not [McDuff was] acting as a
broker.” McDuff subsequently filed a motion for clarification of the law judge’s remarks and
argued that the law judge should not limit the hearing to the “broker-dealer issue.” On February
29, 2016, the law judge responded in an order stating that the Commission had directed him to
(…continued)
of a collateral bar in a follow-on proceeding where a broker-dealer was enjoined by a U.S.
district court from violating the federal securities laws).

consider two questions: whether McDuff was acting as a broker or dealer at the time of his
misconduct, and what sanctions, if any, are in the public interest.14 The law judge further stated
“[t]he question of sanctions was thoroughly addressed in the parties’ summary disposition
briefing, and may not require additional evidence.”15 The law judge added, however, that he had
“issued no orders and made no final rulings on the scope of the issues to be litigated at the
hearing, and [he] intend[ed] to give both parties an opportunity to be heard on that subject before
the hearing commences.”16
On April 1, 2016, McDuff filed another motion for a ruling on the scope of the hearing,
arguing that the hearing should “not be limited to the broker-dealer issue” but “must be plenary
instead.” The law judge held a second prehearing conference on April 11, 2016, during which
McDuff argued that he should be allowed to relitigate issues from the underlying civil and
criminal proceedings, including calling certain witnesses, and that the Division should not be
allowed to rely on transcripts from those earlier proceedings. The law judge rejected these
arguments, stating that McDuff could not relitigate issues that had been previously decided
against him and finding that McDuff’s proposed witnesses were not relevant given the hearing’s
limited scope—explaining that the “main issue” at the hearing would be to consider whether
McDuff had acted as a broker-dealer at the time of his misconduct, but adding that “[t]he hearing
will also proceed on some of the public interest factors.”17 To that end, the law judge stated that
McDuff and his son could testify about whether a sanction would be in the public interest.
The law judge further stated that he “intend[ed] to rely upon the entirety of Mr. McDuff’s
criminal record transcript” in making a final decision.18 The law judge acknowledged that many
of the witnesses’ statements from the criminal trial “would not necessarily be considered
admissible,” but concluded that “it would be in the interest of justice to do so” here because
McDuff had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses at his criminal trial but chose not to
do so.19 McDuff asked the law judge to certify his decisions for interlocutory review, which the
law judge denied.

Standards For Interlocutory Review

The Commission has “plenary authority over the course of its administrative proceedings
and the rulings of its law judges—both before and after the issuance of the initial decision and
irrespective of whether any party has sought relief.”20 Section 4A of the Exchange Act provides
that, with respect to the delegation of any of its functions, the Commission retains “a
discretionary right to review the action of any . . . administrative law judge . . . upon its own
initiative or upon petition of a party to or intervenor in such action. . . .”21 Indeed, the
Commission has reviewed initial decisions of law judges and has corrected factual or legal
errors, even when neither side has petitioned the Commission for review.22
The Commission has directed law judges to prepare initial decisions in any proceeding at
which they preside.23 In so doing, law judges may regulate the course of a proceeding, including
issuing subpoenas, receiving relevant evidence, and ruling upon procedural and other motions.24
The propriety of each of those decisions, and the initial decision itself, are reviewable by the
Commission.25

Indeed, an initial decision of the Commission does not become a final decision of the
Commission until the Commission takes action and issues a finality order. See 17 C.F.R. §
201.360(d)(2).

6
With respect to Commission review of a law judge’s rulings prior to the issuance of an
initial decision, Rule of Practice 400 provides the governing standards.26 Rule 400 “is the
exclusive remedy for review of a hearing officer’s ruling prior to Commission consideration of
the entire proceeding.”27
Rule 400 provides that rulings may be submitted to the Commission for interlocutory
review by obtaining certification from the law judge.28 A hearing officer “shall not certify a
ruling” unless, upon application by a party, the hearing officer is of the opinion (1) that the ruling
“involves a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of
opinion” and (2) an “immediate review of the order may materially advance the completion of
the proceeding.”29 However, that a law judge certifies a question for interlocutory review does
not require that the Commission grant review.30
The rule, however, also provides that the Commission may consider petitions for
interlocutory review by a party who has not sought certification. Rule 400 provides that the

interlocutory review of determinations by a law judge and the sole mechanism for appeal of

Id. A “controlling question of law” is one that typically involves a “pure” question of law
that can be decided “quickly and cleanly without having to study the record.” Ahrenholz v. Board
of Trustees, 219 F.3d 674, 676–78 (7th Cir. 2000) (denying interlocutory appeal). The hearing
officer may also certify a ruling that “would compel testimony of Commission members,
officers, or employees or the production of documentary evidence in their custody.” Id.
30

17 C.F.R. § 201.400(a). Compare e.g., Benjamin G. Sprecher, Exchange Act Release No.
36574, 1995 WL 735903, at *1 (Dec. 12, 1995) (“The law judge has also certified to us her
refusal to issue the subpoenas . . . . We find that interlocutory review of that ruling is not
warranted or appropriate, and we accordingly decline to consider it.”) with e.g., Albert Glenn
Yesner, Exchange Act Release No. 42030, 1999 WL 955777, at *1 (Oct. 19, 1999) (“The
Division then filed an application to have the December 3, 1998 Order (“Order”) certified to us.
The law judge certified the Order on December 11, 1998. We accept certification.”).

7
Commission may decline to consider “the petition of a party who has been denied certification if
it determines that interlocutory review is not warranted or appropriate under the
circumstances.”31 That the Commission may decline to consider a petition for interlocutory
review where certification is denied contemplates that there are also appropriate circumstances
where the Commission may accept a petition for interlocutory review following a denial of
certification. The Commission’s discretion to grant interlocutory review exists “even when the
law judge has declined to certify the ruling in question.”32 A petition in such a posture is no
different from a petition where certification has not been sought at all. The Commission’s
authority to review a petition for interlocutory review—absent certification or where certification
is denied—is derivative of its plenary authority over its administrative proceedings, and is
embodied in Rule 400: the Commission “may, at any time, on its own motion, direct that any
matter be submitted to it for review.”33
Thus, a party, absent certification, may seek interlocutory review directly from the
Commission. To the extent that prior Commission opinions or Rule 400 may be read to suggest

31

17 C.F.R. § 201.400(a).

32

See, e.g., Harding Advisory LLC, Exchange Act Release No. 30892, 2014 WL 988532, at *4
n.15 (Mar. 14, 2014); Rules of Practice, Exchange Act Release No. 35833, 1995 WL 370829, at
*32772 (June 23, 1995) (“[T]he Commission may take up a matter on its own motion at any
time, even if a hearing officer does not certify it for interlocutory review.”)
33

Rules of Practice, 1995 WL 370829, at *32771; see also Adoption of Amendments to the
Rules of Practice, 2004 WL 503739, at *12 (“[T]he Commission retains discretion to undertake
such [interlocutory] review on its own motion at any time.”); cf. 17 C.F.R. § 201.411(d)
(providing that on review by the Commission of an initial decision the Commission may, “at any
time prior to the issuance of [a final Commission] decision, raise and determine any . . . matters
that it deems material”).

8
otherwise,34 we clarify—and state again—that the absence of certification is not a barrier to a
party’s ability to seek interlocutory review of an issue before a law judge.35
Nonetheless, the Commission’s “emphatic preference—which embodies the ‘general
rule’ disfavoring piecemeal, interlocutory appeals—is that claims should be presented in a single
petition for review after ‘the entire record [has been] developed’ and ‘after issuance by the law
judge of an initial decision.’”36 A party’s disagreement with the law judge’s determination “does
not make a ruling ‘appropriate for interlocutory review.’”37
Indeed, Rule 400 provides that petitions for interlocutory review are “disfavored” and
will be granted only in “extraordinary circumstances” to “make clear that petitions for
interlocutory review . . . rarely will be granted.”38
The Commission has emphasized, for example, that it will not grant petitions for
interlocutory review of “fact-bound, discretionary procedural rulings.”39 Similarly, it will not
grant petitions for interlocutory review of decisions about the hearing’s scope or the admission of

34

In Jean-Paul Bolduc, Exchange Act Release No. 42096, 1999 WL 1048643, at *2 (Nov. 4,
1999), for example, we said that “Rule 400 does not contain any provision relating to a party’s
ability to petition the Commission directly for interlocutory review of a hearing officer’s ruling.”
That was the case at the time of that decision. See Rules of Practice, 1995 WL 370829, at *59.
But the Commission subsequently amended Rule 400 to include the language regarding petitions
for interlocutory review discussed above. Adoption of Amendments to the Rules of Practice,
2004 WL 503739, at *12, 29. Even under the prior rule, the Commission retained the authority
to conduct interlocutory review on its own motion. 15 U.S.C. 78(d)-1(b); 17 C.F.R. 201.400
(1999). Indeed, although the law judge had declined to certify the ruling in Bolduc, the
Commission determined “to review the law judge’s ruling in the July 2 Order on our own motion
pursuant to Rule of Practice 400(a).” 1999 WL 1048643, at *2.
35

For example, in American Electric Power Co., Order Denying Intervention as a Party and
Granting Right of Cross-Examination, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-11616 (Jan. 7, 2005), the law
judge denied a party’s request to intervene in the proceeding, and denied certification of that
ruling for interlocutory review. Id. Notwithstanding the denial of certification, we granted the
party’s petition for interlocutory review and reversed the law judge. Id.; see also Clarke T.
Blizzard, Advisers Act Release No. 2030, 2002 WL 662783, at *1 (Apr. 23, 2002) (granting
interlocutory review “notwithstanding the denial of law judge certification”).

evidence.40 The Commission will also not grant petitions for interlocutory review of “pre-trial
discovery orders,” and “complaints about production of documents” will not ordinarily “warrant
. . . interference with the orderly hearing process.”41 “When denying interlocutory review of law
judges’ discovery rulings, the Commission has often invoked the principle that review following
issuance of an initial decision is sufficient to protect parties’ rights.”42 Interlocutory review
would be granted only in “a truly unusual case,” where “serious and prejudicial error were
plainly apparent upon even a cursory review of the record,” and where “deferring review until
issuance of an initial decision might well postpone an inevitable later vacatur and remand.”43
Otherwise, the petition for interlocutory review will not present the “extraordinary circumstances
justifying our intervention before the completion of proceedings before the law judge.”44 The
filing of a petition for interlocutory review “shall not stay proceedings” unless the law judge or
the Commission enters an order to that effect;45 thus, unless and until a stay is obtained, parties
must continue to comply with the law judge’s rulings, file any required papers, and appear at
scheduled hearings.46
This standard for granting petitions for interlocutory review highlights the importance of
the certification process:
First, issues that do not satisfy Rule 400(c) will almost never be appropriate for
interlocutory consideration by the Commission. The Commission generally does not grant
petitions for interlocutory review where the law judge has declined to certify the ruling. 47 The
Rule 400(c) inquiry is intended to identify the rare set of issues that are appropriate for

interlocutory review.48 Rarer still are the extraordinary circumstances that are appropriate for
interlocutory review but that do not involve issues that meet the standards of Rule 400(c).49
Second, a petition for interlocutory review in a case where there has not been any
consideration by the law judge of the relevant issues, e.g. where certification has not been
sought, is also likely inappropriate for interlocutory consideration.50 That is for good reason. As
part of the certification process, the law judge makes certain determinations that are helpful to
the Commission’s analysis as to whether interlocutory appeal is appropriate. The certification
process, therefore, promotes the development of the record relevant to the Commission’s review
of the interlocutory petition. A law judge’s evaluation of the Rule 400(c) factors, given its
familiarity with the facts and legal issues involved in the case and the proceedings to-date, will
aid the Commission’s determination as to whether interlocutory review is appropriate.51

purpose of providing the Appellate Court with the best informed opinion that immediate review

justify Commission review,” notwithstanding the denial of certification, in light of the law
judge’s refusal to postpone the hearing due to respondent counsel’s necessary post-operative
medical treatment), cited in Sassano, 2007 WL 4699012, at *3 n.9

See Edward M. Daspin, Exchange Act Release No. 77088, 2016 WL 492228, at *1 (Feb. 9,
2016) (treating the Division’s motion to stay proceedings before a law judge as “an interlocutory
appeal” and ruling that the application was “premature” because “there ha[d] been no ruling by
the law judge and the Division ha[d] not sought certification for interlocutory review”).
51

This is why, in some cases, we have said that, “[s]tanding alone, a failure to seek or obtain
certification [is] basis enough for the Commission to deny . . . interlocutory review.” John
Thomas Capital, Exchange Act No. 9664, 2014 WL 5282156, at *3 (Oct. 16, 2014) (quotations
and alterations omitted); accord Harding Advisory LLC, 2014 WL 988532, at *4. In John
Thomas Capital, 2013 WL 6384275, at *2, and John Thomas Capital, Exchange Act Release No.
71415, 2014 WL 294551, at *1 (Jan. 28, 2014), we also said that a party must “obtain[]
certification from the law judge” before seeking interlocutory review. In each of these cases, and
others, including Bolduc, supra note 34, in which we have said that the denial of certification
presents a “sufficient basis” to deny a petition for interlocutory review, we have also done so
while considering the merits of the application for interlocutory review and finding the denial of
certification appropriate. Harding Advisory LLC, 2014 WL 988532, at *4; John Thomas
Capital, 2014 WL 294551, at *1; John Thomas Capital, 2013 WL 6384275, at *2.
Accordingly, these statements should be understood as reflecting the Commission’s strong
preference that a party seek certification to provide the Commission with the law judge’s views
on whether the issues are worthy of interlocutory review, not a holding that absent certification,

The Commission’s decision not to accept a petition for interlocutory review does not
preclude a party from renewing his arguments before the Commission in an eventual appeal, and
the Commission can provide any necessary relief in the course of its review process. The
Commission “can, if necessary, remedy a law judge’s erroneous ruling as to the scope of [the
hearing or record] ‘in the same way that an [appellate court can] remedy a host of other
erroneous evidentiary rulings: by vacating [the initial decision] and remanding for a new’
hearing at which the parties have access to all the evidence to which they are entitled.”52
Furthermore, the Commission has the authority to direct that the record be supplemented
pursuant to Rule of Practice 452 and allow additional briefing before issuing a final Commission
decision.53 The Commission may also request that any “document offered in evidence but
excluded by the hearing officer . . . be transmitted to the Commission by the Secretary.”54 The
Commission’s review of an initial decision protects a party from any erroneous evidentiary
rulings or other ruling which may not be appropriate for interlocutory consideration.
II.

McDuff’s Petition Does Not Raise Issues Appropriate For Interlocutory Review
McDuff asks the Commission to review the law judge’s allegedly erroneous decisions

that
(1) this public hearing will be limited to the broker-dealer issue as purportedly
instructed by this Commission on summary disposition reversal and remand, (2)
affidavits and declarations previously submitted by both parties will be admitted
into evidence without a witness availability showing, (3) the transcripts of the
underlying criminal trial would be admitted into evidence without affording the
undersigned the right to call and cross-examine them because it was not done so
(…continued)
the Commission lacks authority to grant such review. To the extent these statements imply that
the absence of certification is a jurisdictional bar to interlocutory review, such an interpretation is
inconsistent, as discussed above, with the Exchange Act, the Rules of Practice, and our authority
over administrative proceedings.

(citing Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 108–09 (2009) (confirming “settled”
rule disfavoring interlocutory review of “pretrial discovery orders” on the ground that
“postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants”); Westmoreland v. CBS,
Inc., 770 F.2d 1168, 1172 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (observing that review of “[o]rders relating to
discovery matters . . . must usually wait until a final judgment”)); see also Rule of Practice 452,

hearing officer for the taking of additional evidence as appropriate”).

in the criminal proceeding on different issues, and (4) issues already litigated at
said criminal trial would not be retried.
We conclude that the issues that McDuff has identified do not warrant granting his petition.
First, the law judge’s rulings on admissibility of evidence are inappropriate, for the
reasons we explain above, for interlocutory consideration. Second, the law judge’s pre-hearing
decisions about what issues McDuff can litigate at the hearing and whether to allow prior witness
statements all turn on issues of collateral estoppel55—issues that involve quintessentially mixed
questions of law and fact that are inappropriate for certification.56
Moreover, an interlocutory review of the law judge’s rulings will not materially advance
completion of the proceeding. If the Division is ultimately unable to establish that McDuff was
acting as a broker or dealer, there would be no statutory basis for further proceedings, and many
of the issues McDuff now raises would become moot.
Although the Commission finds no basis to grant the petition for interlocutory review, we
take this opportunity to clarify the legal parameters around some of the issues in the proceeding
in light of our plenary authority over administrative proceedings.57 While the law judge is
correct that a respondent in a follow-on proceeding cannot relitigate an underlying district court
decision,58 we note the preclusive effects of McDuff’s civil injunction and criminal conviction
55

See, e.g., Wolfe v. Perry, 412 F.3d 707, 716 (6th Cir. 2005) (stating that “[t]he availability of
collateral estoppel is a mixed question of law and fact”); Ibrahim v. FINR III, LLC, No. 8:15-cv1093-T-17, 2016 WL 409630, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 3, 2016) (denying interlocutory appeal of
bankruptcy court’s application of collateral estoppel because that type of ruling did “not raise
issues of pure law that can be decided quickly and cleanly,” but rather raised “mixed questions of
law and fact that would require the reviewing court to go rooting through the record in search of
facts” (quotations omitted)).
56

See, e.g., Montford & Co., 2011 WL 5434023, at *2 (agreeing with the law judge’s decision
not to certify respondents’ petition for interlocutory review where the controlling question was
“a mixed one of law and fact”); Sands Bros. Asset Mgmt., LLC, Advisers Act Release No. 4083,
2015 WL 2229281, at *3 n.9 (May 13, 2015) (denying petition for interlocutory review where
the law judge’s ruling did not involve a question of law that controlled the outcome of the
proceeding).

See, e.g., City of Anaheim, 1999 WL 1034489, at *1 (reviewing interlocutory order on
Commission’s own motion “in the interests of expediting the disposition of this matter, avoiding

3792730, at *5 (Aug. 26, 2011) (that “follow-on proceedings based on a criminal conviction are
not an appropriate forum to ‘revisit the factual basis for,’ or legal defenses to, the conviction”);

are limited. The limited effect of those decisions include the related sentencing proceedings,
which courts have warned should only be given preclusive effect “in those circumstances where
it is clearly fair and efficient to do so” and that “the burden should be on the [party seeking
preclusive effect] in the civil case to prove these elements.”59 A respondent in a follow-on
proceeding “may introduce evidence regarding the ‘circumstances surrounding’ the conduct that
forms the basis of the underlying proceeding as a means of addressing ‘whether sanctions should
be imposed in the public interest.’”60 The law judge must also give careful scrutiny to any prior
testimony that he determines may be introduced “in the interests of justice” under Rule 23561 but
that was not subject to cross-examination.62 Given the preliminary stages of this proceeding, and

v. C.I.R., 489 F.3d 1018, 1023 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding that criminal sentencing proceedings
should not ordinarily be given preclusive effect in subsequent civil litigation); United States v.
Mickman, No. CIV.A. 89-7826, 1993 WL 541683, at *3–4 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 22, 1993) (precluding

hearing, but not precluding defendant from challenging facts that he disputed during sentencing
but which the sentencing judge decided against him).

first instance whether and to what extent these considerations apply here.
For the reasons above, it is ORDERED that Gary L. McDuff’s petition for interlocutory
review is denied.
