REPORT ON THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF CREDIT RATING
AGENCIES IN THE OPERATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
As Required by Section 702(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”) has
prepared this Report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of
the securities markets in response to the Congressional directive contained in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”).1 The Report is designed to address
each of the topics identified for Commission study in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including
the role of credit rating agencies and their importance to the securities markets,
impediments faced by credit rating agencies in performing that role, measures to improve
information flow to the market from rating agencies, barriers to entry into the credit
rating business, and conflicts of interest faced by rating agencies. As the report called for
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act coincided with a review of credit rating agencies already
underway at the Commission, the Report addresses certain issues regarding rating
agencies, such as allegations of anticompetitive or unfair practices, the level of diligence
of credit rating agencies, and the extent and manner of Commission oversight, that go
beyond those specifically identified in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
While the Commission has made significant progress in its review of credit rating
agencies, and identified a wide range of issues that deserve further study, much work
remains to be done. Accordingly, the Commission plans to publish a concept release
within 60 days of this Report to address concerns related to credit rating agencies and
expects to issue proposed rules, after reviewing and evaluating the comments received on
the concept release, within a reasonable period of time after the close of the comment
period.2 The Commission hopes to elicit extensive comments on these issues, from
market participants, other regulators, and the public at large.
The issues to be studied by the Commission in more depth include the following:
Information Flow

1

2

•

Whether rating agencies should disclose more information about their ratings
decisions.

•

Whether there should be improvements to the extent and quality of disclosure by
issuers (including disclosures relating to ratings triggers).

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, § 702(b), 116 Stat. 745 (2002).

The Commission is mindful that some of the concepts discussed in this report may raise questions
about the limits of the Commission’s authority. We will, of course, consider those issues carefully.

Potential Conflicts of Interest
•

Whether rating agencies should implement procedures to manage potential
conflicts of interest that arise when issuers pay for ratings.

•

Whether rating agencies should prohibit (or severely restrict) direct contacts
between rating analysts and subscribers.

•

Whether rating agencies should implement procedures to manage potential
conflicts of interest that arise when rating agencies develop ancillary fee-based
businesses.

Alleged Anticompetitive or Unfair Practices
•

The extent to which allegations of anticompetitive or unfair practices by large
credit rating agencies have merit and, if so, possible Commission action to
address them.

Reducing Potential Regulatory Barriers to Entry
•

Whether the current regulatory recognition criteria for rating agencies should be
clarified.

•

Whether timing goals for the evaluation of applications for regulatory recognition
should be instituted.

•

Whether rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market, or confine
their activity to a limited geographic area, should be recognized for regulatory
purposes.

•

Whether there are viable alternatives to the recognition of rating agencies in
Commission rules and regulations.

Ongoing Oversight
•

Whether more direct, ongoing oversight of rating agencies is warranted and, if so,
the appropriate means for doing so (and whether it is advisable to ask Congress
for specific legislative oversight authority).

•

Whether rating agencies should incorporate general standards of diligence in
performing their ratings analysis, and with respect to the training and
qualifications of credit rating analysts.

INTRODUCTION

Section 702 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires the Commission to conduct a
study of the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities
markets, and to submit a report on that study to the President, the Committee on Financial
Services of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs of the Senate not later than January 26, 2003. This Report has been
prepared in response to that requirement.
A primary purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is to assure the integrity of the
United States capital markets and restore investor confidence in the wake of recent
financial scandals.3 Among other things, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act directs the Commission
to examine the following:
(A) the role of credit rating agencies in the evaluation of issuers of securities;
(B) the importance of that role to investors and the functioning of the securities
markets;
(C) any impediments to the accurate appraisal by credit rating agencies of the
financial resources and risks of issuers of securities;
(D) any barriers to entry into the business of acting as a credit rating agency, and
any measures needed to remove such barriers;
(E) any measures which may be required to improve the dissemination of
information concerning such resources and risks when credit rating agencies
announce credit ratings; and
(F) any conflicts of interest in the operation of credit rating agencies and
measures to prevent such conflicts or ameliorate the consequences of such
conflicts.
Congress itself also has been reviewing issues relating to credit rating agencies.
In March 2002, for example, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs (“Senate
Committee”) held hearings to determine how the credit rating agencies could have rated
Enron Corporation (“Enron”) as a good credit risk until just four days before the
company declared bankruptcy. 4 In October 2002, the staff of the Senate Committee
issued a report (the “Staff Report”)5 containing the results of its investigation into, among

Urban Affairs, to President George W. Bush (October 18, 2002).

other things, the actions of certain credit rating agencies that monitored the financial
activities of Enron in the years prior to its collapse. The Staff Report concluded that, in
the case of Enron, the credit rating agencies displayed a disappointing lack of diligence in
their coverage and assessment of that company. In addition, the Staff Report found that,
because the credit rating agencies are subject to little formal regulation or oversight, and
their liability traditionally has been limited by regulatory exemptions and First
Amendment protections, there is little to hold them accountable for future poor
performance. As a result, the Staff Report recommended that the Commission, among
other things, require recognized rating agencies to comply with specified performance
and training standards and regularly monitor their compliance with those standards.
The issues reviewed in the Staff Report, as well as the study required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, are consistent with recent Commission initiatives to review the role
of rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets and their regulatory treatment.6 The
Commission recognized that, in recent years, the importance of credit ratings to investors
and other market participants had increased significantly, impacting an issuer’s access to
and cost of capital, the structure of financial transactions, and the ability of fiduciaries
and others to make particular investments. In light of this increased importance, the
Commission had commenced a review of the use of credit ratings in federal securities
laws, the process of determining which credit ratings should be used for regulatory
purposes, and the level of oversight to apply to recognized rating agencies.
The Commission pursued several approaches, both formal and informal, to
conduct a thorough and meaningful study of credit rating agencies. These efforts
included informal discussions with credit rating agencies and market participants, formal
examinations of credit rating agencies, and public hearings, where market participants
were given the opportunity to offer their views on credit rating agencies and their role in
the capital markets.
Part II of this Report contains a background discussion of credit rating agencies,
and how credit ratings have become incorporated into the current regulatory framework.
Part III describes in more detail recent Congressional and Commission initiatives to
review the role of credit rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets. A detailed
discussion of each of the topics Congress directed the Commission to examine in Section
702 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is contained in Part IV. Finally, Part V sets forth a range
of issues regarding the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the
securities markets that the Commission intends to explore in more depth.

BACKGROUND
A.

General

In essence, a credit rating reflects a rating agency’s opinion, as of a specific date,
of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. For almost a
century, credit rating agencies have been providing opinions on the creditworthiness of
issuers of securities and their financial obligations. During this time, the importance of
these opinions to investors and other market participants, and the influence of these
opinions on the securities markets, have increased significantly. This is due in part to the
increase in the number of issuers and the advent of new and complex financial products,
such as asset-backed securities and credit derivatives. The globalization of the financial
markets also has served to expand the role of credit ratings to countries other than the
United States, where the reliance on credit ratings largely was confined for the first half
of the twentieth century. Today, credit ratings affect securities markets in many ways,
including an issuer’s access to capital, the structure of transactions, and the ability of
fiduciaries and others to make particular investments.
During the past 30 years, regulators, including the Commission, have increasingly
used credit ratings to help monitor the risk of investments held by regulated entities, and
to provide an appropriate disclosure framework for securities of differing risks. Since
1975, the Commission has relied on ratings by market-recognized credible rating
agencies for distinguishing among grades of creditworthiness in various regulations under
the federal securities laws. These “nationally recognized statistical rating organizations,”
or “NRSROs,” are recognized as such by Commission staff through the no-action letter
process. There currently are three NRSROs – Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
(“Moody’s”), Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”), and the Standard and Poor’s Division of the McGrawHill Companies Inc. (“S&P”). Although the Commission originated the use of the term
“NRSRO” in regulation, ratings by NRSROs today are widely used as benchmarks in
federal and state legislation, rules issued by financial and other regulators, foreign
regulatory schemes, and private financial contracts.
In recent years, the Commission and Congress have reviewed a number of issues
regarding credit rating agencies and, in particular, the need for greater regulatory
oversight of them. As discussed in detail in Section II.C. below, in 1994, the
Commission issued a Concept Release soliciting public comment on the appropriate role
of ratings in the federal securities laws, and the need to establish formal procedures for
recognizing and monitoring the activities of NRSROs.7 That Concept Release led to a
rule proposal in 1997 which, among other things, would have defined the term “NRSRO”
in Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”),8 the
7

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Release No. 34-34616 (August 31,
1994), 59 FR 46314 (September 7, 1994) [hereinafter the “Concept Release”].

See Capital Requirements for Brokers or Dealers Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

“Proposing Release”].

Commission’s net capital rule (the “Net Capital Rule”). However, due to concerns
regarding, among other things, the standards defining the term “NRSRO,” and the
initiation of broad-based Commission and Congressional reviews of credit rating
agencies, the Commission has not acted upon its rule proposal.
B.

Regulatory Use of Credit Ratings

The term “NRSRO” was originally adopted by the Commission in 1975 solely for
determining capital charges on different grades of debt securities under the Net Capital
Rule.9 The Net Capital Rule requires broker-dealers, when computing net capital, to
deduct from their net worth certain percentages of the market value of their proprietary
securities positions. A primary purpose of these “haircuts” is to provide a margin of
safety against losses that might be incurred by broker-dealers as a result of market
fluctuations in the prices of, or lack of liquidity in, their proprietary positions. The
Commission determined that it was appropriate to apply a lower haircut to securities held
by a broker-dealer that were rated investment grade by a credit rating agency of national
repute, because those securities typically were more liquid and less volatile in price than
securities that were not so highly rated.10 The requirement that the credit rating agency
be “nationally recognized” was designed to ensure that its ratings were credible and
reasonably relied upon by the marketplace.
Over time, as marketplace and regulatory reliance on credit ratings increased, the
use of the NRSRO concept became more widespread. Today, NRSRO ratings are widely
used for distinguishing among grades of creditworthiness in federal and state legislation,
rules issued by financial and other regulators, and even in some foreign regulations. The
Commission itself has incorporated the NRSRO concept into additional areas of the
federal securities laws. Several regulations issued by the Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933,11 the Exchange Act,12 and the Investment Company Act of
9

See Adoption of Amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and Adoption of Alternative Net Capital
Requirement for Certain Brokers and Dealers, Release No. 34-11497 (June 26, 1975), 40 FR 29795 (July
16, 1975). At the time the Commission adopted the term “NRSRO,” certain securities exchanges,
including the New York Stock Exchange, utilized credit ratings for calculating haircuts for purposes of
their respective net capital rules. See, e.g., NYSE Rule 325(c)(5) and (c)(6), 2 CCH NYSE GUIDE, ¶ 2325
(1971). Further, a number of states used the concept of ratings to limit the investment discretion of certain
fiduciaries and, in so doing, generally relied only on ratings that were assigned by rating agencies
designated as reliable by the state.

10

See 17 CFR § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(E) (haircuts applicable to commercial paper), 17 CFR §
240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) (haircuts applicable to nonconvertible debt securities), and 17 CFR § 240.15c31(c)(2)(vi)(H) (haircuts applicable to cumulative nonconvertible preferred stock). The term NRSRO is also
used in appendices to the Net Capital Rule. See 17 CFR § 240.15c3-1a(b)(1)(i)(C) (defining the term
“major market foreign currency”) and 17 CFR § 240.15c3-1f(d) (determining the capital charge for credit
risk arising from certain OTC derivatives transactions).
11

See Regulation S-B (17 CFR § 228.10(e)) and Regulation S-K (17 CFR § 229.10(c)) (both of
which were also adopted under the authority of the Exchange Act); Rule 134 (communications not deemed
a prospectus) (17 CFR § 230.134(a)(14)); Rule 436 (consents required in certain cases) (17 CFR §
230.436(g)); Form S-3 (17 CFR § 239.13); Form F-2 (17 CFR § 239.32); and Form F-3 (17 CFR § 239.33).

1940,13 utilize the term "NRSRO" and cross-reference to the Net Capital Rule. For
example, Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 limits money market
funds to investing in only high quality short-term instruments, and NRSRO ratings are
used as benchmarks for establishing minimum quality investment standards. Under Rule
2a-7, a money market fund is limited to investing in securities rated by an NRSRO in the
two highest ratings categories for short-term debt (or unrated securities of similar
quality), and there are limitations on the amount of securities the fund can hold that are
not rated in the highest rating category (or are not unrated securities of similar quality).14
In addition, in regulations adopted by the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933,
offerings of certain nonconvertible debt, preferred securities, and asset-backed securities
that are rated investment grade by at least one NRSRO can be registered on Form S-3 –
the Commission’s “short-form” registration statement – without the issuer satisfying a
minimum public float test.15
In addition, Congress has incorporated the NRSRO concept into a wide range of
financial legislation. 16 For example, when Congress defined the term "mortgage related
12

See Rule 3a1-1 (exemption from the definition of “exchange” under Section 3(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act) (17 CFR § 240.3a1-1(b)(3)); Rule 10b-10 (confirmation of transactions) (17 CFR §
240.10b-10(a)(8)); Rules 101 (activities by distribution participants) and 102 (activities by issuers and
selling security holders during a distribution) of Regulation M (17 CFR §§ 242.101(c)(2) and 242.102(d),
respectively); and Rule 300 of Regulation ATS (definitions of “investment grade corporate debt security”
and “non-investment grade corporate debt security”) (17 CFR §§ 242.300(k)(3) and (l)(3)).

13

See Rule 2a-7 (money market funds) (17 CFR § 270.2a-7(a)(10)); Rule 3a-7 (issuers of assetbacked securities) (17 CFR § 270.3a-7(a)(2); Rule 5b-3 (acquisition of repurchase agreement or refunded
security treated as acquisition of underlying securities) (17 CFR § 270.5b-3(c)); and Rule 10f-3 (exemption
for the acquisition of securities during the existence of an underwriting or selling syndicate) (17 CFR §
270.10f-3(a)(3)).

14

Investment Company Act of 1940 Rule 2a-7(c)(3) (limiting a money market fund to acquiring
“Eligible Securities”) (17 CFR § 270.2a-7(c)(3)); Rule 2a-7(a)(10) (defining “Eligible Security” as a “rated
security” that has received a rating from the “Requisite NRSROs” in one of the two highest short-term
ratings categories) (17 CFR § 270.2a-7(a)(10)); and Rule 2a-7(c)(4)(C) (limiting a money market fund to
investing no more than one percent of its assets in any individual security and no more than five percent of
its total assets in all securities that are “Second Tier” securities) (17 CFR § 270.2a-7(c)(4)(C)). Under Rule
2a-7, NRSRO ratings are minimum requirements; fund advisers must also make an independent
determination that the security presents “minimal credit risks.” Rule 2a-7(c)(3)(i). In addition, some
regulations incorporate NRSRO ratings indirectly by, for example, permitting investment only in funds
regulated as money market funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. See, e.g., 17 CFR §
1.25(a)(vii) (permitting futures commission merchants to invest customer funds in money market funds).

security" in Section 3(a)(41) of the Exchange Act,17 as part of the Secondary Mortgage
Market Enhancement Act of 1984,18 it required, among other things, that such securities
be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one NRSRO. Further, in
1989, Congress added the NRSRO concept to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,
prescribing that corporate debt securities are not “investment grade” unless they are rated
in one of the four highest categories by at least one NRSRO.19
Finally, a number of other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations today
employ the NRSRO concept. For example, the U.S. Department of Education uses
ratings from NRSROs to set standards of financial responsibility for institutions that wish
to participate in student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (Title IV).20 In addition, several state insurance
codes rely, directly or indirectly, on NRSRO ratings in determining appropriate
investments for insurance companies.21 And the use of the NRSRO concept has occurred
in foreign jurisdictions. 22
C.

Recognition of NRSROs

In 1975, when NRSRO ratings first were incorporated in the Net Capital Rule, the
Commission staff, in consultation with the Commission, determined that the ratings of
S&P, Moody's, and Fitch were used nationally, and that these firms should be considered

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-242 (1991); and
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-72 (1989).

21

For example, the California Insurance Code relies on NRSRO ratings in allowing Californiaincorporated insurers to invest excess funds in certain types of investments. Specifically, Section 1192.10
of the California Insurance Code requires that certain investments by an insurer be rated in one of the three
highest rating categories by at least one NRSRO approved by the Commission, and within one of the two
highest rating categories established by the Securities Valuation Office (“SVO”) of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners. See Cal. Ins. Code § 1192.10. Insurance codes in a number of
states refer to credit ratings by NRSROs as defined by the SVO. See, e.g., Tex. Ins. Code art. 2.10-4 and
N.J. Stat. § 17:24-29. The SVO, in turn, defines the term “NRSRO” in its Purposes and Procedures Manual
as a rating organization designated as an NRSRO by the SEC which has applied to, and whose NRSRO
status has been confirmed by, the SVO. Among other things, the SVO is responsible for the day-to-day
credit quality assessment and valuation of securities owned by state-regulated insurance companies. These
assessments and valuations are then used to help monitor the financial condition of insurance companies.

22

In El Salvador, for example, a rating agency can register as a “classifier of risk” under the
country’s securities laws if the rating agency is an NRSRO as recognized by the SEC. See Law of the
Securities Market, El Salvador, Title VI, Chapter II, Section 88(a). D.L. Not. 374, Published in the Official
Newspaper No. 149, Volume 340 of August 14, 1998.

NRSROs for purposes of the Net Capital Rule.23 Since 1975, the Commission staff has
issued no-action letters with respect to NRSRO status to four additional rating agencies:
(1) Duff and Phelps, Inc.;24 (2) McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei, Inc.;25 (3) IBCA Limited
and its subsidiary, IBCA, Inc.;26 and (4) Thomson BankWatch, Inc.27 Each of these firms
has since merged with or been acquired by other NRSROs, with the result that presently
only the three original NRSROs remain. A number of requests from additional rating
agencies for recognition of NRSRO status currently are under review by Commission
staff, however, so that the number of NRSROs may very well increase in the foreseeable
future.
1.

NRSRO Recognition Criteria

Commission staff initially did not adopt specific standards for determining which
credit rating agencies were nationally recognized for their services, preferring instead to
address the question on a case-by-case basis. But through the subsequent no-action letter
process, Commission staff developed a number of objective criteria for assessing national
recognition. As a result, under current practice, Commission staff reviews the rating
agency’s operations, position in the marketplace, and other specific factors to determine
whether it should be considered an NRSRO.28
The single most important factor in the Commission staff’s assessment of
NRSRO status is whether the rating agency is “nationally recognized” in the United
States as an issuer of credible and reliable ratings by the predominant users of securities
ratings. The staff also reviews the operational capability and reliability of each rating
organization. Included within this assessment are: (1) the organizational structure of the
rating organization; (2) the rating organization’s financial resources (to determine, among
other things, whether it is able to operate independently of economic pressures or control
from the companies it rates); (3) the size and quality of the rating organization’s staff (to
determine if the entity is capable of thoroughly and competently evaluating an issuer’s
credit); (4) the rating organization’s independence from the companies it rates; (5) the

rating organization’s rating procedures (to determine whether it has systematic
procedures designed to produce credible and accurate ratings); and (6) whether the rating
organization has internal procedures to prevent the misuse of nonpublic information and
whether those procedures are followed. The staff also recommends that the agency
become registered as an investment adviser.
If the Commission staff determines that a rating agency can be considered an
NRSRO, it issues a “no-action” letter stating that it will not recommend enforcement
action to the Commission if ratings from the rating agency are considered by registered
broker-dealers to be ratings from an NRSRO for purposes of applying the relevant
portions of the Net Capital Rule. On the other hand, if the staff concludes that a rating
agency should not be considered an NRSRO, it may issue a letter denying a request for
no-action relief. 29

Recent Initiatives

In recent years, the Commission and Congress have reviewed a number of issues
regarding credit rating agencies and the need for greater regulatory oversight of them.
Several of the instances in which the Commission and Congress reviewed the regulatory
treatment of credit rating agencies coincided with a large scale credit default, such as
those of Orange County, California, and the Washington Public Power Supply System.
Ten years ago, for example, the Commission considered a number of alternatives in an
attempt to determine the appropriate regulatory treatment of rating agencies for purposes
of the federal securities laws.30 The three primary alternatives considered by the
Commission were: (a) eliminating reliance on NRSRO ratings for purposes of
Commission rules; (b) retaining the use of NRSRO ratings in Commission rules and the
current method for designating rating agencies as NRSROs; and (c) implementing more
direct and expanded oversight of credit rating agencies, given their growing importance
in the financial and regulatory scheme. The Commission did not reach a consensus on
the need for change at that time, however, and so by not taking action the existing system
of NRSRO recognition and oversight was retained.

a.

1994 Concept Release

In 1994, the Commission issued a Concept Release31 soliciting public comment
on the Commission’s use of NRSRO ratings. Because of the expanded role played by
credit ratings in Commission rules, a number of domestic and foreign rating agencies had
been prompted to seek NRSRO status. Concerns had been expressed about the fact that
Commission rules did not define “NRSRO,” and that there was no formal mechanism for
monitoring the activities of NRSROs. As a result, the Commission believed it
appropriate to solicit public comment on the appropriate role of ratings in the federal
securities laws, and the need to establish formal procedures for designating NRSROs and
monitoring their activities. Specifically, comment was solicited on: (1) whether the
Commission should continue to use the NRSRO concept and, if so, whether the term
“NRSRO” explicitly should be defined in Commission rules; and (2) whether the existing
no-action letter process for recognizing NRSROs was satisfactory and, if not, the
alternative procedures to be established.
The Commission received 25 comment letters in response to the Concept Release
and, in general, they supported the continued use of the NRSRO concept. Among other
things, commenters believed the use of NRSRO ratings had become an integral part of
the Net Capital Rule, and a vital ingredient in the Commission’s efforts to safeguard the
capital markets against risks arising from fluctuations in the proprietary positions of
securities firms. 32 A few commenters suggested the Commission discontinue the use of
the NRSRO concept and instead employ statistical models or historical spreads to
determine the level of risk associated with a particular instrument.33
Most comment letters received in response to the Concept Release recommended
that the Commission adopt a formalized process for approving NRSROs. The
commenters generally shared the view that the no-action procedures in place at that time
did not contain sufficient guidance on how to submit an application for NRSRO
recognition and the types of information that should be included in the application.
Specifically, commenters recommended that the Commission formalize the current noaction letter criteria for recognizing NRSROs in a Commission rule.34 A few

in the context of determining the credit risk of individual financial instruments. See Proposing Release,

formal regulatory oversight of NRSROs, particularly to the extent regulation might
interfere with a rating agency’s credit rating process or rating judgments.36
b.

1997 Rule Proposal

As a response to the Concept Release and the comments received thereon, the
Commission, in 1997, proposed to amend the Net Capital Rule to define the term
“NRSRO.”37 The proposed amendments set forth criteria to be considered by the
Commission in recognizing rating organizations as NRSROs, and establish an application
process for NRSRO recognition. An NRSRO would be defined as an entity that: (1)
issues ratings that are current assessments of the creditworthiness of obligors with respect
to specific securities or money market instruments; (2) is registered as an investment

Federal Regulation of Securities, American Bar Association, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC
(December 5, 1994) [hereinafter the “Liftin Letter”] (“[W]e advocate the adoption of a more formalized
process for designation that would be based on the definition of ‘NRSRO,’ would utilize the existing
factors currently recognized as relevant by the Commission, and would preserve the independent judgment
of the Commission in any future grant of NRSRO designation.”); Letter from Brian I. Neysmith, Canadian
Bond Rating Service, Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (November 10, 1994) (“[T]he criteria or
parameters required to obtain [NRSRO] designation must be well defined, reasonable, and
distinguishable.”); and Letter from Itsuo Yamamoto, Managing Director, Nippon Investors Service Inc., to
Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (December 1, 1994) [hereinafter the “Yamamoto Letter”] (advocating
“implementation of clear objective standards”).
35

NRSRO recognition criteria suggested in response to the Concept Release included certain
minimum, objective criteria. See, e.g., the Yamamoto Letter, supra note 34, recommending, among other
things, that NRSROs have at least $50 million in paid-in-capital, that they rate at least 100 issuers on a
periodic basis, and that they have at least 30 full-time analysts. The Commission subsequently invited
further comment on whether objective criteria should be used to determine NRSRO recognition and the
types of objective criteria that should be considered. See Proposing Release, supra note 8. There was no
substantial support for adding minimum objective standards to the NRSRO criteria. See infra note 41.
36

See, e.g., the Liftin Letter, supra note 34 (“The Commission should not attempt to regulate the
process by which NRSROs assign ratings. The market itself effectively and efficiently regulates
NRSROs.”); Letter from Patrick M. Frawley, Director, Regulatory Relations Group, NationsBank
Corporation, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, SEC (December 5, 1994) (“Setting standards for NRSROs, and
designating them as such after an application process, is sufficient to ensure quality rating services.”);
Letter from Brian J. Heidtke, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, Colgate-Palmolive Company, to
Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (“[O]fficial regulations uniformly applied to rating agencies as a
formally defined group will erode the market-determined forces which help ensure the independence and
impartiality vital to sound credit analysis and judgment.”); Letter from Clifford J. Grum, Temple-Inland
Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (December 1, 1994) (“[Regulation of NRSROs would] cause
significant practical difficulties, cost burdens, and the potential for reducing the objectivity of the ratings
process.”); and Letter from John C. Sargent, Vice President and Treasurer, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and
Company, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (December 5, 1994) (“[I]mposing a regulatory framework

seem to warrant any ‘mid-course’ correction or government intervention.”).

adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and (3) is designated an NRSRO by
the Commission.
In determining whether to recognize a rating organization as an NRSRO, the
proposed amendments provided that the Commission would consider five specific
attributes of the applicant, which are substantially similar to those reviewed by the staff
as part of the no-action letter process. Specifically, the Commission would consider: (1)
national recognition (i.e., whether the rating organization is recognized as an issuer of
credible and reliable ratings by the predominant users of securities ratings in the United
States); (2) adequate staffing, financial resources, and organizational structure to ensure
that it can issue credible and reliable ratings of the debt of issuers (including the ability to
operate independently of economic pressures or control by companies it rates and a
sufficient number of staff members qualified in terms of education and experience to
thoroughly and competently evaluate an issuer's credit); (3) use of systematic rating
procedures that are designed to ensure credible and accurate ratings; (4) extent of
contacts with the management of issuers (including access to senior level management of
the issuers); and (5) internal procedures to prevent misuse of nonpublic information and
compliance with these procedures.
In addition, the proposed amendments effectively would establish a formal
Commission process for recognizing NRSROs. Rating organizations seeking NRSRO
designation would file an application with the Director of the Commission’s Division of
Market Regulation that provides detailed information explaining how the rating
organization satisfies each of the required attributes. Commission staff would approve or
reject an application for NRSRO status, pursuant to delegated authority. Finally, an
NRSRO would be required to notify the Commission of any material changes in the
information set forth in its application, and if the Commission determined the NRSRO no
longer satisfied all of the requisite attributes, the rating agency’s NRSRO recognition
could be revoked or withdrawn.
The rule proposal also solicited further comment on whether NRSROs should be
prohibited from charging issuers fees based upon the size of a transaction, as several
commenters to the Concept Release expressed concern that such a fee structure could
compromise a rating organization’s objectivity in large transactions.38 The rule proposal
38

This topic was addressed by six commenters, five of whom disagreed with the concerns raised in
response to the Concept Release. See Letter from Leo C. O’Neill, President and Chief Rating Officer,
S&P, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, SEC (February 27, 1998) [hereinafter the “O’Neill Letter”] (“The
ongoing value of a rating organization’s business is wholly dependent on continued investor confidence in
the credibility and reliability of its ratings, and no single fee or group of fees could be important enough to
the organization to jeopardize its future business.”); Letter from Mari-Anne Pisarri, Pickard and Djinis
LLP, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (March 2, 1998) [hereinafter the “Pisarri Letter”] (“While
[Thomson BankWatch, Inc. (‘TBW’)] does not believe that charging issuers per se has an untoward effect
on the quality of the ratings produced, TBW believes that such charges should be based on the time and
effort that goes into the rating process and not on the size of the transaction.”); Letter from Matthew C.
Molé, Vice President & General Counsel, Moody’s, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (March 2, 1998)
[hereinafter the “Molé Letter”] (“The SEC should not attempt to substitute its judgment as to the value of
such services for that of issuers or the investors who, by accepting lower yields from issuers, ultimately pay
the agency’s fees.”); Letter from Neil D. Baron, Vice Chairman and General Counsel, Fitch, to Jonathan G.

also invited comments on: (1) whether a specific time period should be established for
the Commission to act on an application for NRSRO recognition (e.g., a range of 180 to
365 calendar days);39 (2) whether NRSROs should be required to make their ratings
generally available to the public (as opposed to restricting their distribution to
subscribers);40 (3) whether objective criteria should be used to determine NRSRO
recognition and, if so, the types of objective criteria that should be considered;41 and (4)
Katz, Secretary, SEC (March 13, 1998) [hereinafter the “Baron Letter”] (“[A]n unjustifiably favorable
rating on any issue is destructive to our most important asset – or reputation – and therefore to our business.
Unjustifiably favorable ratings are even more visible, and therefore more destructive to reputation, when
they are assigned to larger issues.”); and Letter from Barron H. Putnam Ph.D., Financial
Economist/President, LACE Financial Corporation, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (received on April
23, 1998) [hereinafter the “Putnam Letter”] (“[F]ees should be set by the marketplace and not by the
government.”). One commenter, however, disagreed with the practice of charging issuers for ratings,
commenting that there is an inherent conflict of interest when a rating agency is compensated by a firm
whose securities are being rated by the rating agency. See Letter from Sean J. Egan, Managing Director,
Egan-Jones Ratings Company, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (March 2, 1998 revised) [hereinafter
the “Egan Letter”] (“[W]e believe being compensated for ratings by issuers makes it difficult to point out
that the ‘emperor has no clothes.’”).
39

Three commenters addressed the topic of whether a specific time period should be established for
the Commission to act on requests to be recognized as an NRSRO. Each commenter stated that a specific
time period should be established. See the Egan Letter, supra note 38 (“180 days or less”); the Pisarri
Letter, supra note 38 (“[A] decision on an NRSRO application should be made within 45-60 calendar days
after submission.”); and Letter from Douglas L. Getter, Esq., Dewey Ballantine LLP, and David B.H.
Martin, Jr., Esq., Hogan & Hartson L.L.P., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (February 13, 1998)
[hereinafter the “Getter/Martin Letter”] (“within 90 days after submission”).
40

Five commenters addressed the topic of whether NRSROs should be required to provide their
ratings to the public. Four commenters generally supported the view that NRSROs must make their ratings
available to the public in order for their ratings to be recognized for regulatory purposes. These
commenters differed, however, as to which ratings they believed should be made publicly available and
when. See Letter from Ernest T. Elsner, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Duff & Phelps
Credit Rating Co., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (February 28, 1998) [hereinafter the “Elsner
Letter”] (“The market should have access to [ratings] and, more importantly, the underlying data to support
the ‘rationale’ of the rating.”); the Pisarri Letter, supra note 38 (“[R]atings on publicly issued debt should
be made available to the public, whereas the distribution of other ratings (such as on private placements or
the issuers themselves) might properly be restricted to paid subscribers.”); the Molé Letter, supra note 38
(“[R]atings of an NRSRO that are eligible for use for regulatory purposes need to be publicly available on
an historical basis to permit statistical testing of correlation and congruence.”); and the Baron Letter, supra
note 38 (“We believe that NRSRO ratings of securities that are expected to be traded in the secondary
market should be publicly available through release on the newswire services.”). The fifth commenter did
not believe that NRSROs should be required to provide their ratings to the public. See the Egan Letter,
supra note 38 (“[R]equiring that a firm make its ratings available at no charge to be recognized as an
NRSRO creates an insurmountable barrier [to entry].”).
41

The Commission received nine comment letters responding to its request on whether objective
criteria should be used to recognize NRSROs, and proposing types of objective criteria that should be
considered. See, e.g., Letter from Nobuhiro Saito, Managing Director, Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd.,
to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (February 18, 1998) (“[W]e believe [rules for recognizing NRSROs]
should be more objective and transparent to the rating agencies.”); the O’Neill Letter, supra note 38
(“[T]he [Net Capital Rule], if amended, should include but one standard for designation: a pre-existing
national recognition and use of a rating organization’s ratings in the financial marketplace.”); the Egan
Letter, supra note 38 (“Regarding the use of objective standards, we believe the main criteria should be

14

whether there are practical approaches to the use of statistical models for determining the
credit risk of individual financial instruments, that might serve as a regulatory substitute
for NRSRO credit ratings.42
Although commenters were generally pleased with the Commission’s attempt to
define the requirements necessary for a rating agency to be designated as an NRSRO, due
to concerns regarding, among other things, the standards defining the term “NRSRO,”
and the initiation of broad-based Commission and Congressional reviews of credit rating
agencies, the Commission has not acted upon the rule proposal described above.

40 (proposing the following criteria: (1) consistency in the use of rating symbols or designations that are
comparable with other NRSROs; (2) public disclosure of ratings and rationale for the ratings assigned; (3)
publicized standards to provide the users of the ratings with sufficient information to fairly and accurately
evaluate the nature of assigned ratings; (4) breadth of experience over a wide range of markets and
industries in the U.S. capital markets; and (5) disclosure of ratings issued without the cooperation of the
issuer and recognition for regulatory purposes of ratings only issued with contact with management of
issuers); the Molé Letter, supra note 38 (“If not eliminated altogether, NRSRO qualifications should be
determined solely by ‘National Recognition’ . . . [T]he fundamental determinants of ‘national recognition’
[are] (i) an impact of [a rating agency’s ratings] on bond prices that is independent of the impact thereon of
regulation, (ii) tight correlation over time between its ratings and actual default experience, and (iii)
substantial congruence – or at least the absence of illusory congruence – between its rating scale and those
of rating agencies that have already achieved such recognition.”); Comments of the United States
Department of Justice in the Matter of: File No. S7-33-97 Proposed Amendments to Rule 15c3-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (March 6, 1998) (“The Department . . . supports the Commission’s
suggested criteria for making decisions on [NRSRO] applications, subject to two specific concerns. First . .
. the current formulation of the Commission’s ‘recognition’ requirement creates a problematic barrier to
entry into an industry that is already highly concentrated. Second, while the Department supports the
Commission’s criteria concerning access to senior management and the use of systematic rating
procedures, the Department notes that these criteria would best be served by a disclosure requirement for
situations, such as unsolicited ratings, in which the criteria could often not be met.”); the Getter/Martin
Letter, supra note 39 (“[T]he Proposal continues to ignore important attributes, objective or otherwise, that
demonstrate the recognition that a non-U.S. rating agency receives from the domestic and international
financial community.”); the Baron Letter, supra note 38 (“[T]he Amendment should place a priority on
recognition by investors above recognition by other participants such as issuers and investment bankers.”);
and the Putnam Letter, supra note 38 (“We feel that quality ([education] and experience) is very important
and should be part of the criteria. Size of an applicant for NRSRO status should depend on how well they
rate institutions. Size should not be a determining factor.”).
42

Four comment letters discussed the use of statistical models for purposes of the NRSRO concept.
All four commenters generally agreed that quantitative, statistically derived credit scores are not as useful
or as reliable as analytically derived credit ratings. See the Pisarri Letter, supra note 38; the Egan Letter,
supra note 38; the Baron Letter, supra note 38; and the O’Neill Letter, supra note 38.

RECENT INQUIRIES INTO THE ROLE OF CREDIT RATING AGENCIES
A.

Senate Initiatives

1.

Enron-Related Credit Rating Agency Hearing

In January 2002, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs launched a
broad investigation into the Enron collapse, focusing on the role of government and
private sector watchdogs, and the steps, if any, that could have been taken to detect
Enron’s problems or prevent its failure. On March 20, 2002, the Senate Committee held
a hearing – entitled “Rating the Raters: Enron and the Credit Rating Agencies” – that
focused on the role of credit rating agencies in the Enron collapse. That hearing sought
to elicit information on why the credit rating agencies continued to rate Enron a good
credit risk until four days before the firm declared bankruptcy, and to determine how
future Enron-type calamities could be avoided. Concerns had been expressed regarding
the significant market power of the three NRSROs, their privileged access to nonpublic
issuer information,43 their apparent lack of care and diligence in the Enron situation, and
their very limited regulatory oversight.
The first hearing panel was composed of senior Enron analysts from each of the
three NRSROs.44 In general, they took the position that their ratings depended on the
accuracy and completeness of the information furnished by Enron, its counsel,
accountants and other experts. In retrospect, however, it was evident to them that Enron,
in fact, provided misleading information, and failed to disclose other important facts,
thereby undermining the accuracy and reliability of their ratings. 45
The second hearing panel consisted of two academics,46 the CEO of a credit
research firm,47 and then-SEC Commissioner Isaac C. Hunt, Jr. One of the academics
was of the view that credit rating agencies do not provide useful or timely information
about the creditworthiness of companies in today’s markets and, accordingly, Congress
should instruct the relevant regulatory authorities to abandon the use of credit ratings in

regulation where possible.48 The other academic, although skeptical of the ability of
government regulation of rating agencies to improve their performance or reduce costs,
took the position that some form of regulatory approval of rating agencies is appropriate
to the extent credit ratings are used in regulation.49 The credit research firm
representative believed the Commission should retain the NRSRO designation, but set
clear and specific criteria for NRSRO recognition. Among other things, he was of the
view that: (1) rating agencies should disclose material risks they uncover in the ratings
review process (even if that information has not been disclosed by the issuer in financial
filings or otherwise); (2) rating agencies should report to the Commission any material
risks that appear to be inadequately addressed in public disclosures; (3) rating agencies
should place more weight on the analytical significance of various accounting quality
issues; and (4) there should be a registration and certification program for senior rating
agency analysts that have decision-making power.50 Then-Commissioner Hunt explained
the Commission’s use of credit ratings in regulation, previous initiatives involving credit
rating agencies, and the Commission’s intent to engage in a thorough examination of the
role of rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets.51

Governmental Affairs Committee Staff Report

On October 8, 2002, the staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs
issued a report (the “Staff Report”) entitled Financial Oversight of Enron: The SEC and
Private-Sector Watchdogs,52 which contains, among other things, the results of the
Committee staff’s investigation into the actions of the three NRSROs in the years prior to
Enron’s collapse. The Staff Report addresses the perceived failures of credit rating
agencies to fulfill their responsibilities to prevent or warn of the impending failure of
Enron, and provides recommendations with respect to how their future performance
could be improved.53

53

On January 3, 2003, the staff of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued an
additional Report entitled “Enron’s Credit Rating: Enron’s Bankers’ Contacts with Moody’s and
Government Officials.” In the course of the Senate Committee’s investigation, questions had been raised,
among other things, about efforts by Enron’s bankers to convince Moody’s not to downgrade Enron. In its
Report, the staff of the Senate Committee concluded that Moody’s November 8, 2001 decision not to
downgrade Enron’s credit rating below investment grade was not based on improper influence or pressure,
but on new information presented by financial institutions and others that in Moody’s view changed
Enron’s circumstances.

17

The Staff Report concluded that, in the case of Enron, the credit rating agencies
failed to use their legally-sanctioned power and access54 to the public’s benefit, instead
displaying a lack of diligence in their coverage and assessment of Enron. The Staff
Report found that the credit rating agencies did not ask sufficiently probing questions in
formulating their ratings, and in many cases merely accepted at face value what they
were told by Enron officials. Further, the rating agencies apparently ignored or glossed
over warning signs, and despite their mission to make long-term credit assessments,
failed to sufficiently consider factors affecting the long-term health of Enron, particularly
accounting irregularities and overly complex financing structures. The Staff Report also
noted that, because credit rating agencies are subject to little, if any, formal regulation or
oversight, and their liability traditionally has been limited both by regulatory exemptions
and First Amendment protections afforded them by the courts, little exists to hold them
accountable for future poor performance.
As a result, the Staff Report recommended that the Commission, in consultation
with other agencies that reference NRSRO ratings in their regulations (e.g., the banking
agencies), set specific conditions on the NRSRO designation through additional
regulation, to ensure that the reliance of the public on credit rating agencies is not
misplaced.
The recommended conditions would include: (a) standards and
considerations to be used by credit rating agencies in deriving their ratings, such as those
addressing accounting issues; and (b) standards for training levels of credit rating analysts
(including training on the information contained in periodic SEC and other regulatory
filings and training in basic forensic accounting). The Staff Report also recommended
that the Commission monitor compliance with these requirements and, in the event of a
future corporate meltdown such as Enron, conduct an investigation to ensure that the
applicable credit ratings were derived in accordance with those standards.

Broad-Based Commission Review

The issues addressed by the Staff Report, as well as the study required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, were consistent with work previously undertaken by the
In addition, on July 23, 2002, representatives of Moody’s and S&P testified before the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations regarding the assistance major financial institutions gave Enron
with respect to its use of misleading complex transactions. See The Role of the Financial Institutions in
Enron’s Collapse, Hearings Before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, 107th Cong.
618 (2002) (testimony of John C. Diaz, Managing Director, Power & Energy Group, Moody’s, Pamela M.
Stumpp, Managing Director, Chief Credit Officer, Corporate Finance Group, Moody’s, and Ronald M.
Barone, Managing Director, S&P). That hearing focused on how Enron used certain structured finance
transactions to obtain billions of dollars in financing without showing any additional debt on its books.
During the hearings, representatives of S&P and Moody’s indicated they were unaware of the existence of
Enron’s prepaid forward and related swap transactions and, had the transactions been disclosed as loans,
such disclosures would have exerted downward pressure on Enron’s credit rating.

Commission to review the role of rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets and the
need for greater regulation in this area. The Commission recognized that, in recent years,
the importance of credit ratings to investors and other market participants had increased
significantly, impacting an issuer’s access to and cost of capital, the structure of financial
transactions, and the ability of fiduciaries and others to make particular investments. In
light of these changes, the Commission had commenced a review of the use of credit
ratings in the federal securities laws, the process of determining which credit ratings
should be used for regulatory purposes, and the level of oversight to apply to recognized
rating agencies.
The Commission pursued several approaches, both formal and informal, to
conduct a thorough and meaningful study of these issues. Commission efforts included
informal discussions with credit rating agencies and market participants, formal
examinations of each of the NRSROs, and public hearings that offered a broad crosssection of market participants the opportunity to communicate their views on credit rating
agencies and their role in the capital markets.
On March 19, 2002, the Commission issued an Order directing investigation,
pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act, into the role of rating agencies in the U.S.
securities markets.55 The purpose of the Order was to ascertain facts, conditions,
practices, and other matters relating to the role of rating agencies in the U.S. securities
markets, and to aid the Commission in assessing whether to continue to use credit ratings
in its regulations under the federal securities laws and, if so, the categories of acceptable
credit ratings and the appropriate level of regulatory oversight.
2.

Commission Examinations of NRSROs

Pursuant to the Commission’s March 2002 Order of Investigation, as well as the
Commission’s examination authority under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
Commission examination staff conducted formal examinations of each of the three
NRSROs. In these examinations, Commission staff reviewed documents and information
provided by each NRSRO regarding its policies and procedures, as well as documents
concerning its ratings of certain issuers, and interviewed various NRSRO staff.
Commission staff also interviewed senior finance personnel from a number of issuers that
were rated by the NRSROs.
The Commission’s examination of the NRSROs revealed several concerns,
including those relating to: (a) potential conflicts of interest caused by the fact that issuers
pay the NRSROs for their ratings;56 (b) exacerbation of those conflicts of interest due to
55

See Order In the Matter of the Role of Rating Agencies in the U.S. Securities Markets Directing
Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Designating Officers
for Such Designation (March 19, 2002). File 4-454-3.

56

In addition, the staff found evidence that indicated the NRSROs may not be in compliance with
Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, with respect to disclosure of the receipt of compensation from
issuers for rating their securities.

the marketing by the NRSROs of ancillary services to issuers, such as pre-rating
assessments and corporate consulting, thereby heightening the NRSROs’ dependence on
issuer revenue; (c) the potential for the NRSROs, given their substantial power in the
marketplace, to improperly pressure issuers to pay for ratings; (d) the potential for the
NRSROs, given their substantial power in the marketplace, to improperly pressure issuers
to purchase ancillary services; (e) the effectiveness of the NRSROs’ existing policies and
procedures designed to protect confidential information; and (f) the effectiveness of the
Commission’s examination being hampered by, among other things, the lack of
recordkeeping requirements tailored to NRSRO activities, the NRSROs’ assertions that
the document retention and production requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 are inapplicable to the credit rating business, and their claims that the First
Amendment shields the NRSROs from producing certain documents to the Commission.

Credit Rating Agency Hearings

The Commission’s broad-based study of credit rating agencies culminated in
public hearings held late last year. On November 15 and 21, 2002, the Commission
conducted full-day public hearings to address a wide range of issues relating to credit
rating agencies in the operation of the U.S. securities markets.57 Panel participants
represented a wide range of views, including those of the NRSROs, non-NRSRO rating
agencies, broker-dealers, buy-side firms, issuers, and the academic community.58
Commissioners and Commission staff also participated in each hearing.

Each hearing addressed the same topics but with a different set of participants.
Broad topic areas included: (a) the current role and functioning of credit rating agencies;
(b) information flow in the credit rating process; (c) concerns regarding credit rating
agencies (e.g., potential conflicts-of-interest or abusive practices); and (d) the regulatory
treatment of credit rating agencies (including concerns regarding potential barriers to
entry). Highlights of the hearing discussions, organized by broad topic area, are
summarized below.
a.
Current Role and Functioning of Credit Rating Agencies. With regard to
the role and functioning of credit rating agencies, representatives from the rating agencies
provided general descriptions of their businesses, such as how they determine which
issues to rate, and the process for issuing and monitoring credit ratings. Rating agencies
generally view their role as assessing the creditworthiness of issuers on an ongoing basis,
and the likelihood that debt will be repaid in a timely manner. They emphasized,
however, that they do not conduct formal audits of rated companies or search for fraud,
and that the nature of their analysis is largely dependent on the quality of information
provided to them.
Representatives of users of credit ratings – mutual funds and broker-dealers –
explained the importance of credit ratings to their businesses. Credit ratings are used by
these institutions both for informational and regulatory purposes. These firms typically
have their own internal credit research departments staffed with analysts who use ratings
issued by credit rating agencies as one of several valuable “inputs” to their independent
credit analysis. In addition, they felt that ratings were critical to the success of the
Commission’s rules regulating money market funds.59
Issuer representatives indicated that they seek credit ratings because of the value
placed on the ratings by investors, and the affect credit ratings have on their ability to
access capital. In selecting which rating agencies to use, issuers seek those capable of a
competent, rigorous analysis that is recognized by the marketplace. As a practical matter,
these have tended to be one or more of the NRSROs.
b.
Information Flow in the Credit Rating Process. A number of issues were
raised with regard to information flow in the credit rating process. Consistent with their
view that credit analysis is largely dependent on quality information, the rating agencies
generally favored measures that would improve information flows from issuers to the
public. Although they believed the regulatory disclosure required of most U.S. issuers
generally is sufficient to enable them to issue reliable ratings, they often seek additional
information from issuers to better understand their business prospects and risks (e.g.,
undisclosed contingencies that could adversely affect the issuer’s liquidity). With regard
to information flow from the rating agencies to the public, the rating agencies highlighted
59

As noted above, Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 prohibits money market
funds from investing in securities that are rated below the two highest categories for short-term debt (or
unrated securities of comparable quality). See supra note 14 and accompanying text.

21

their ongoing efforts to make their rating processes more transparent – by widely
disseminating their ratings and the basic underlying rationale, their ratings criteria, lists of
credit ratings under review, and industry commentary.
Other hearing participants raised concerns regarding the special access of
subscribers to rating agency information and personnel, particularly given the exclusion
from Regulation FD available for disclosures to rating agencies.60 While the larger rating
agencies generally make ratings and the basic rating rationale available simultaneously to
subscribers and non-subscribers, subscribers have access to substantial additional
information, such as detailed rating reports and other analyses, as well as direct access to
rating agency analysts. Some expressed concern that these additional communications –
particularly the informal verbal contacts between subscribers and rating agency analysts –
increased the risk of improper disclosure of confidential information provided by the
issuer.61 Others believe these contacts could inappropriately signal to subscribers
information about upcoming ratings changes (and their associated market impact).
Buy-side representatives generally felt there should be more public disclosure
from rating agencies about the reasons for their ratings decisions. They would like more
information about the assumptions underlying the rating (e.g., company and industry
expectations, time horizons for achieving certain financial goals, specific events or
financial triggers that would prompt a ratings action), as well as more specific disclosure
about the information and documents reviewed by the rating agency.
In addition, some suggested that rating agencies that issue unsolicited ratings
clearly designate them as such, and that there be clear disclosure when a rating agency
terminates coverage of an issuer. Finally, some believed there should be regular public
disclosure of performance information by rating agencies.

60

17 CFR § 243.100(b)(2)(iii). See Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading, Release No. 34-43154
(August 15, 2000), 65 FR 51716 (August 24, 2000). Generally, Regulation FD prohibits an issuer of
securities, or persons acting on behalf of the issuer, from communicating nonpublic information to certain
enumerated persons - in general, securities market professionals or others who may well use the
information for trading - unless the information is publicly disclosed. When Regulation FD was adopted,
the Commission exempted rating agencies – not just NRSROs – from Regulation FD, on the condition that
nonpublic information is communicated to a rating agency solely for the purpose of developing a credit
rating and that the rating is publicly available. The Commission believed it was appropriate to provide this
exclusion from the coverage of Regulation FD because rating agencies "have a mission of public
disclosure." Under this exemption, the ratings process results in a widely available publication of the rating
when it is completed. As a result, the impact of nonpublic information on the creditworthiness of an issuer
is publicly disseminated, without disclosing the nonpublic information itself. In addition to the specific
rating agency exemption in Regulation FD, rating agencies may be able to avail themselves of the
exemption for “persons who expressly agree to maintain the disclosed information in confidence.”

61

The larger credit rating agencies typically maintain confidentiality agreements with issuers they

rate.

22

c.
Concerns Regarding Credit Rating Agencies (e.g., Potential Conflicts-ofInterest or Abusive Practices).
i.
Issuer Influence. In general, hearing participants did not believe that
reliance by rating agencies on issuer fees leads to significant conflicts of interest, or
otherwise calls into question the overall objectivity of credit ratings. While the issuer-fee
model naturally creates the potential for conflict of interest and ratings inflation, most
were of the view that this conflict is manageable and, for the most part, has been
effectively addressed by the credit rating agencies. The rating agencies take the position
that their reputation for issuing objective and credible ratings is of paramount importance,
and that they would be loathe to jeopardize that reputation to mollify a particular issuer.62
Furthermore, the rating agencies have implemented a number of policies and procedures
designed to assure the independence and objectivity of the ratings process, such as
requiring ratings decisions to be made by a ratings committee, imposing investment
restrictions, and adhering to fixed fee schedules. In addition, they assert that rating
analyst compensation is merit-based (e.g., based on the demonstrated accuracy of their
ratings), and is not dependent on the level of fees paid by issuers the analyst rates. While
most hearing participants agreed that, for the most part, the rating agencies had
effectively managed this potential conflict, they stressed the importance of credit rating
agencies implementing stringent firewalls, independent compensation, and other related
procedures.
ii.
Subscriber Influence. As discussed in paragraph (b) above, several
hearing participants expressed concern regarding the special, and perhaps inappropriate,
access to rating information and analysts available to rating agency subscribers.
iii.
Advisory Services. Greater concerns were expressed with respect to
potential conflicts of interest that may arise when a rating agency offers consulting or
other advisory services to issuers it rates, although most hearing participants also
believed these conflicts were manageable. The three NRSROs represented that they had
established extensive guidelines to manage potential conflicts in this area, including
firewalls to separate the ratings services from the influence of other businesses. They
also indicated that advisory services presently represent a very small portion of their total
revenues. Some hearing participants expressed concern that the potential conflict could
become much greater were these services to become a substantial portion of a rating
agency’s business, and suggestions were made that their percentage contribution to the
total revenues of a credit rating agency be capped. Others worried that issuers could be
unduly pressured to purchase advisory services, particularly in cases where they were
solicited by the rating analyst. While this line of business currently is very small, some
viewed the potential conflicts as being analogous to those faced by auditors, which
recently have become subject to extensive independence rules.

62

Fees from any single issuer typically comprise a very small percentage – less than 1% – of a
rating agency’s total revenue.

23

iv.
Abusive Practices. There were reports from some hearing participants that
the largest rating agencies have abused their dominant position by engaging in certain
aggressive competitive practices. For example, Fitch complained that S&P and Moody’s
were attempting to squeeze them out of certain structured finance markets by engaging in
the practice of “notching” – lowering their ratings on, or refusing to rate, securities issued
by certain asset pools (e.g., collateralized debt obligations), unless a substantial portion of
the assets within those pools were also rated by them.63 Fitch suggested, as a possible
solution, that NRSROs be required to recognize the ratings of other NRSROs as their
own for purposes of rating these asset pools.
With respect to unsolicited ratings, some questioned the appropriateness of a
rating agency using what critics termed “strong-arm” tactics to induce payment for a
rating an issuer did not request (e.g., sending a bill for an unsolicited rating, or sending a
fee schedule and “encouraging” payment).
d.
Regulatory Treatment of Credit Rating Agencies (including Concerns
regarding Potential Barriers to Entry). Hearing participants recognized that limited
competition exists today in the credit rating industry and, in general, were of the view
that additional competition would have a beneficial effect on the marketplace. Some
noted that, historically, successful new entrants often established themselves by first
specializing in a particular industry. There was less consensus on the reasons for the
concentration in the credit rating business today. Some believed natural barriers to entry
exist, given the substantial investment and track record necessary to achieve marketplace
acceptance of ratings. Others noted that, as a practical matter, the market may not
demand more than two or three rating agencies.
As to the impact of regulation on competition, most were of the view that the
regulatory use of the NRSRO concept, in and of itself, did not act as a substantial barrier
to entry. In general, hearing participants were of the opinion that NRSRO status is
helpful to a rating agency from a business perspective and, to that extent, has a
competitive impact. But most favored the regulatory use of credit ratings issued by
NRSROs as a simple, efficient benchmark of credit quality, and recognized that
regulatory standards for NRSROs were necessary for this concept to have meaning (i.e.,
to ensure that ratings used for regulatory purposes are reliable), despite the potential
impact on competition.
One concern widely expressed by hearing participants, however, involved the
relative lack of transparency of the existing NRSRO recognition process conducted by
Commission staff. Several suggested that the Commission should specify in more detail
the types of information applicants need to provide to demonstrate, and that the
Commission would review in evaluating, satisfaction of the various NRSRO criteria. In
63

See Press Release, Fitch Ratings, Survey Shows Majority of Structured Finance Executives
Oppose Notching as Practiced by Moody’s and S&P (March 27, 2002). For example, Fitch indicated that
the practice of notching has led to a decline in its market share of ratings for commercial mortgage-backed
securities from 65 percent (in the first three quarters of 2001), to 27 percent (in the first quarter of 2002),
although its market share recently has begun to rebound.

24

addition, some believed that the staff should act upon NRSRO applications in a more
timely fashion. A number of hearing participants – primarily users of ratings and issuers
– suggested that the Commission consider more substantive regulation of rating agencies
(e.g., to address potential conflicts of interest, unfair practices, and information flow), and
engage in more active ongoing oversight of them (e.g., monitoring compliance with the
NRSRO criteria through regular Commission examinations). Others noted that the
Commission might promote competition by explicitly permitting rating agencies that
specialize in particular sectors to become NRSROs.
IV.

DISCUSSION

With the foregoing as background, the following discussion addresses each of the
areas identified for Commission study in Section 702 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
A.

Role of Credit Rating Agencies in the Evaluation of Issuers of
Securities

1.

General Procedures for Evaluating Issuers

The larger credit rating agencies engaged in traditional, fundamental credit
analysis generally approach the rating process with similar procedures and organizational
structures, and these are described below. Rating procedures at these firms are designed
to facilitate analytical consistency and capitalize on area expertise. Organizationally, the
larger rating agencies divide the rating universe into separate categories by industry (e.g.,
energy or banking) and type of instrument (e.g., corporate debt, municipal securities,
structured finance). At the core of the rating process is the rating committee. Rating
committees are generally formed ad hoc to initiate, withdraw, or change a rating. They
typically are composed of a lead credit analyst, managing directors or other area
supervisors, and junior analytical staff. Rating decisions are made upon a simple
majority vote of the committee and are, at their most basic level, an opinion regarding the
likelihood the issuer will repay its financial obligation.
Rating agencies generally designate ratings of long-term debt through some
variation of an alphabetical combination of lower and upper case letters. Fitch and S&P
use the same ranking designators: AAA, AA, A, and BBB are investment grade
categories; BB, B, CCC, CC, C, and D are considered speculative grade rankings.
Moody’s long-term rating designators are: investment grade: Aaa, Aa, A, Baa,
speculative grade: Ba, B, Caa, Ca, and C. Rating agencies often attach modifiers to the
grades to further distinguish and rank ratings within each generic classification. S&P and
Fitch generally use pluses and minuses to modify their grades, while Moody’s generally
uses numerical modifiers 1-3, with 1 indicating that a credit falls in the higher end of the
generic rating category, 2 indicating mid-range, and 3 indicating the lower end of the
ranking.

25

2.

Rating Committee Process

Rating committees typically convene at the behest of a lead analyst or sector
supervisor to, among other things: (a) rate a new issuer or instrument; (b) assess a major
transaction or event that might impact a current rating; or (c) consider putting a rating on
review for change. The lead analyst frames the issues and presents most of the data
under consideration.64 Opinions of all members are considered and vetted, and ultimately
result in a nonpublic committee memorandum that discusses its decision, rationale,
assumptions, and underlying data.65
Committee deliberations are preceded by regular on-going contacts with issuers
and information gathering. Ratings are based on a variety of public and nonpublic
information. Public information reviewed in the ratings process typically includes filings
with the Commission, news reports, industry reports, bond and stock price trends, data
from central banks, and proxy statements. Nonpublic information can include credit
agreements, acquisition agreements, private placement memoranda, and business
projections and forecasts. Nonpublic information is often provided pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement between the rating agency and the issuer, or is provided
premised upon the rating agency’s policy to keep such information confidential. It is
generally the responsibility of the lead analyst to gather this information, frame issues for
committee deliberations, and act as the primary point of contact with an issuer. Annual
and periodic meetings at issuer or rating agency headquarters are common.
Questionnaires and detailed document and information request letters also are used to
gather information from issuers. Rating agencies generally do not, however, conduct
audits or due diligence reviews of issuer-provided information.
3.

Rating Decisions and Publication

Rating agencies generally advise issuers in advance of an imminent rating action
and allow the issuers to appeal the decision. However, the right of appeal is limited both
in time and to the submission of new and important information. The time between a
64

The primary credit considerations used in the corporate finance area involve both non-financial
and financial factors. Some of the non-financial or qualitative considerations include: (1) stability of
markets, (2) diversity of markets, (3) efficiency of operation (e.g., distribution system and operating
margins), (4) peer group analysis, (5) competition and market positions, and (6) government regulation.
Financial or quantitative considerations include: (1) cash generation or use, (2) balance sheet strength, (3)
debt/capitalization ratios, (4) interest coverage ratios, (5) operating cash flow to total debt ratios, and (6)
fixed charge ratios.
65

Whether qualitative or quantitative factors comprise the majority of a rating agency’s credit
analysis will depend on the sector. For instance, with regard to the cable TV industry, qualitative factors
may be the most important consideration. Further, because rating agencies generally want their ratings to
be stable, they sometimes seek to rate through current economic cycles that are characteristic of a particular
industry. However, “rating through a cycle” is not always possible. For instance, speculative-grade
companies with higher levels of leverage may not be able to maintain ratings until pricing cycles recover.
Liquidity constraints over short amounts of time may affect such companies more severely than other more
established companies.

26

committee decision and publication varies from a few hours to a few days, in order to
minimize the inappropriate and premature disclosure of information to the marketplace.
Issuers may be allowed to review and edit press releases to ensure factual accuracy and
prevent the disclosure of confidential information. Rating agencies do not, however,
allow issuers to delete the primary basis of a rating action if the disclosure of confidential
information is not at issue.
In addition to rating actions, rating agencies may also publish rating outlooks. An
outlook is an opinion on the future direction of the rating, and may encompass a period
from one to several years. Outlooks are usually categorized as being positive, negative,
or stable, and are typically included in a rating action press release.66
Rating agencies generally surveil ratings over time by reviewing corporate filings,
monitoring industry trends, and maintaining a dialogue with corporate management.
Rating agencies communicate the results of this surveillance on occasion to the
marketplace through the use of “watch lists.” Watch lists signal to the market that a
rating is under active review for a change (in any direction) and are typically in response
to significant sector or issuer specific events. Typically, issuers or instruments are kept
on a watch list 90–120 days, depending on the practice of a particular rating agency. As
with rating actions, issuers often are informed in advance if they are to be placed on a
watch list, so that they have an opportunity to provide additional information or explain
existing data.
B.

Importance of the Role of Credit Rating Agencies to Investors
and the Functioning of the Securities Markets

Credit ratings can play a significant role in the investment decisions of investors,
and the value investors place on such ratings is evident from, among other things, the
impact ratings have on an issuer’s ability to access capital. Set forth below is a brief
description of how various market participants use credit ratings, and the importance of
rating agencies to their market activities.
1.
Issuers. Issuers seek credit ratings for a number of reasons, such as to
improve the marketability or pricing of their financial obligations, or to satisfy investors,
lenders, or counterparties who want to enhance management responsibility. Public or
private credit ratings may be sought from one or more rating agencies. 67 In certain
markets, such as the U.S. long-term corporate debt market, a single-rated debt issue may
66

Outlooks are sometimes erroneously confused with “placement of a credit on review for a
change.” The primary difference is that an outlook is meant to focus on trends and developments expected
to occur over a longer period than the 90-120 days that a credit would normally be placed on review. The
probability of these developments actually occurring or trends being confirmed are significantly lower than
those events prompting a formal review. Further, outlooks are not necessarily a precursor to placement of a
credit on review.
67

Even if an issuer decides against seeking a credit rating, a rating agency may nonetheless issue a
rating with or without the issuer’s involvement. Ratings not initiated at the request of an issuer commonly
are known as “unsolicited” ratings.

27

be priced below an issue with similar ratings from two agencies, because the absence of a
second rating is interpreted as the issuer’s inability to obtain another equivalent rating. In
other markets, however, such as the asset-backed securities market, a single rating may
be adequate confirmation of asset quality.
2.
Buy-Side Firms. Buy-side firms, such as mutual funds, pension funds,
and insurance companies, are among the largest owners of debt securities, preferred
stock, and commercial paper in the U.S. Retail participation in the debt markets
generally takes place indirectly through these fiduciaries. Most of the large buy-side
firms active in the fixed income markets are substantial users of information from credit
rating agencies, even though they typically conduct their own credit analysis for risk
management purposes, or to identify pricing discrepancies for their trading operations.
Buy-side firms use credit ratings as one of several important inputs to their own internal
credit assessments and investment analyses. For example, a buy-side analyst might
review the rationale underlying a credit rating to better understand the perspectives of
other respected credit analysts, or to anticipate the likelihood of future credit rating
actions. Buy-side firms also may use credit ratings to comply with internal by-law
restrictions or investment policies that require certain minimum credit ratings for
investments, or to identify acceptable counterparties. Finally, buy-side firms use credit
ratings to ensure compliance with various regulatory requirements.
3.
Sell-Side Firms. Like buy-side firms, many sell-side firms (e.g., brokerdealers that make recommendations and sell securities to their clients) conduct their own
credit analysis for risk management and trading purposes. To a large extent, sell-side
firms use credit ratings in a fashion similar to buy-side firms. One difference between
buy-side and sell-side firms, however, is that many broker-dealers also maintain rating
advisory groups. These groups generally assist underwriting clients in selecting
appropriate credit rating agencies for their offerings, and help guide those clients through
the rating process. In addition, sell-side firms often act as dealers in markets that place
significant importance on credit ratings. For example, in the over-the-counter derivatives
market, broker-dealers tend to use credit ratings (when available) to determine acceptable
counterparties, as well as collateral levels for outstanding credit exposures. Finally, large
broker-dealers themselves frequently obtain credit ratings as issuers of long- and shortterm debt.
4.
Regulatory Use of Ratings. Credit ratings are used for regulatory purposes
around the world, primarily in the context of financial regulations. The regulatory use of
credit ratings increases their importance to certain market participants. For example,
ratings play an important role in the commercial paper market, where issuers find it
difficult to sell paper that does not qualify for investment by money market funds under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.68 The regulatory use of credit ratings in
68

The exact impact Investment Company Act of 1940 Rule 2a-7 has on the commercial paper
market is unclear, however. Most money market funds voluntarily limit themselves to investing in
securities rated higher than necessary to be eligible investments under Rule 2a-7, which suggests that
investor requirements may also contribute to the difficulties encountered by lower rated issuers in issuing
commercial paper.

28

the U.S. is described in detail in Section II.B. above. In addition, the regulatory use of
credit ratings in foreign markets appears to be growing. A recent survey by the Bank for
International Settlements, for example, summarizes the various ways financial regulatory
authorities around the world use credit ratings in their regulations today.69 That survey
was undertaken in connection with the proposal of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision to permit banks to use ratings from credit rating agencies in determining
capital requirements under the new Basel Capital Accord.
5.
Use of Ratings in Private Contracts. The extensive use of credit ratings in
private contracts also has enhanced the importance of credit ratings to the marketplace.
For example, the widespread use of “ratings triggers”70 in financial contracts recently has
received considerable attention as a result of certain high-profile bankruptcies, such as
Enron and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (“PG&E”).71 In the case of Enron, the use
of credit ratings as “triggers” in trading and other financial agreements gave
counterparties the right to demand cash collateral, and lenders the right to demand
repayment of outstanding loans, once Enron’s credit rating declined to certain levels. As
a result, the existence of ratings triggers contributed to Enron’s financial difficulties.72
Similarly, the impact of credit rating downgrades on PG&E’s financial agreements
limited its ability to borrow funds to repay its short term debt obligations. 73 In cases
such as these, contractual ratings triggers can seriously escalate liquidity problems at
firms faced with a deteriorating financial outlook. As noted in Section V below, because
of the significant potential negative impact of contractual ratings triggers on issuers, the
Commission intends to explore whether issuers should be required to provide more
extensive public disclosure regarding such triggers.74 In addition, credit rating agencies
and others have been conducting intensive studies to better understand the nature and
extent of the use of credit ratings in financial contracts, and their potential impact on a
company’s liquidity and creditworthiness. 75

Impediments to the Accurate Appraisal of Issuers by Credit Rating
Agencies

One of the most fundamental impediments to the accurate appraisal of issuers by
credit rating agencies is the inability of rating agencies to access a continuous flow of
accurate and reliable information from issuers. Some have questioned whether the level
of public disclosure by issuers is adequate. As discussed below, the Commission recently
has taken steps to improve the extent and quality of information disclosed by issuers,
with the goal of assuring that the marketplace (including rating agencies) has better
information with which to evaluate the risks of those securities. In addition, some have
expressed concern regarding the recent performance of credit rating agencies, particularly
in the case of Enron, and questioned whether the rating agencies have been using the
appropriate level of diligence in conducting their analysis and fulfilling their important
role in the marketplace.
1.

Level of Public Disclosure by Issuers

In the course of our study, concerns were expressed about the level of public
disclosure by issuers. At the Commission’s credit rating agency hearings, several
specific areas for improved issuer disclosure were mentioned, including the need for
additional detail regarding an issuer’s short-term credit facilities and, particularly in light
of the Enron experience, better disclosure of the existence and nature of “ratings triggers”
in contracts material to an issuer.
In essence, “ratings triggers” are contractual provisions that terminate credit
availability or accelerate credit obligations in the event of specified rating actions, with
the result that a rating downgrade could lead to an escalating liquidity crisis for issuers
subject to ratings triggers.76 Given the potentially catastrophic impact ratings triggers
could have on an issuer, disclosure of their existence both to rating agencies and the
public would appear critical. In the aftermath of the Enron bankruptcy, the rating
agencies appear to have become more diligent in seeking information regarding ratings
triggers.77 Nevertheless, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring
whether additional issuer disclosures should be required, including disclosures relating to
the existence and impact of ratings triggers.
companies from guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) that allow contract holders to surrender the GIC
for its book value in the event the insurance company’s credit ratings decline below certain levels).
76

See Moody’s Special Comment, supra note 75.

77

Shortly after the Enron bankruptcy, several of the larger credit rating agencies surveyed a number
of U.S. and European companies to determine their exposure to ratings triggers. According to the
published surveys, the rating agencies indicated that few companies appeared to be exposed to a high
degree of risk on account of ratings triggers, other than those previously known to them. In addition, some
companies and lenders appear to have acknowledged that the use of ratings triggers can backfire and
precipitate a liquidity crisis and, accordingly, are beginning to remove ratings triggers from their
agreements. See, e.g., Rating Action: Moody’s Confirms El Paso Corp.’s Debt Ratings (Baa2 SR. UNS.)
in Response to Debt Reduction Plan That Includes Elimination of Rating Triggers (December 12, 2001).

30

More generally, the Commission has taken a number of steps in recent months to
improve the extent and quality of issuer disclosure. The Commission recently adopted
rules significantly shortening the time period between the end of an issuer’s quarter or
fiscal year and the due date of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form
10-K.78 In January 2003, the Commission adopted rules regarding the disclosure of nonGAAP financial information.79 These rules also require issuers to furnish their earnings
releases on a current report on Form 8-K. In addition, the Commission adopted revisions
to its rules governing Management’s Discussion and Analysis to require disclosure of offbalance sheet arrangements, contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and
commitments.80 The Commission recently proposed rules relating to enhanced disclosure
of material events on current report on Form 8-K, which would also require a significant
acceleration of the filing deadline, and enhanced disclosure regarding critical accounting
policies.81 These rule proposals are pending and the Commission staff is currently
reviewing comments received in order to determine what recommendations to make to
the Commission. The impact of all of these initiatives, among other things, should be to
enhance the ability both of rating agencies and investors to evaluate the credit quality of
issuers. In addition, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring whether
there should be additional improvements to the extent and quality of disclosure by
issuers, including disclosures relating to conditional elements of important financial
contracts, ratings triggers, short-term credit facilities, special purpose entities, and
material future liabilities.
2.

Diligence and Qualifications of Credit Rating Agency Analysts

In the aftermath of the Enron situation and other recent corporate failures, some
have criticized the performance of the credit rating agencies, and questioned whether they
are conducting sufficiently thorough analyses of issuers, particularly given their special
position in the marketplace. Concerns also have been raised regarding the training and
qualifications of credit rating agency analysts.
In particular, the Staff Report, issued in connection with the investigation by the
Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Enron situation, found that, while the
credit rating agencies did not completely ignore the problems at Enron, “their monitoring
and review of [Enron’s] finances fell far below the careful efforts one would have

expected from organizations whose ratings hold so much importance.”82 According to
the Staff Report, in some cases the rating agencies appeared simply to take the word of
Enron officials when issues were raised, and failed to probe more deeply. In addition, the
credit rating agency analysts seemed to have been less than thorough in their review of
Enron’s public filings, even though these filings are a primary source of information for
the ratings decision. Among other things, the rating analysts appeared to pay insufficient
attention to the detail in Enron’s financial statements, failed to probe opaque disclosures,
did not review Enron’s proxy statements, and failed to take into account the overall
aggressiveness of Enron’s accounting practices. In essence, the Staff Report found that
the rating agencies failed to use the necessary rigor to ensure their analysis of a complex
company, such as Enron, was sound.83 Accordingly, as discussed in Section III.A.2.
above, the Staff Report recommended the Commission impose standards for credit rating
agencies in deriving their ratings. 84
The rating agencies tend to have a more limited view of their role in verifying
information reviewed in the credit rating process. In general, the rating agencies state
that they rely on issuers and other sources to provide them with accurate and complete
information. 85 They typically do not audit the accuracy or integrity of issuer information.
Though rating agencies may at times be able to use their influence in the marketplace to
compel issuers to provide additional information, they have no legal power to subpoena
issuer information. In cases where a rating agency concludes that important information
is unavailable, or an issuer is less than forthcoming with them, the rating agency may,
depending on the significance of the information involved, issue a lower rating, refuse to
issue a rating, or even withdraw an existing rating. In general, the rating agencies
indicate that reputational concerns are sufficient to ensure that they exercise appropriate
levels of diligence in the ratings process.
Nevertheless, as noted in Section V below, the Commission intends to explore
whether NRSROs should incorporate general standards of diligence in performing their
ratings analysis, and with respect to the training and qualifications of credit rating
analysts.

Measures to Improve the Dissemination of Information by Credit
Rating Agencies

The nature and extent of information made available to the public and/or
subscribers varies from one credit rating agency to another. Credit rating agencies may
provide comprehensive, lengthy research reports detailing the criteria and support for

Primary sources of information cited by the rating agencies generally included issuers, auditors,
investment bankers, and public and private databases.

32

their ratings, or they may provide less intensive summary information that can be quickly
and easily reviewed, or both. The rating rationale provided by credit rating agencies may
be primarily qualitative, or primarily quantitative, or a combination of the two. Some
credit rating agencies – typically those less dependent on subscriber revenues – make
their ratings and rating rationale publicly available, at no charge, on their internet web
sites and through press releases. (Subscribers typically are provided with more detailed
information.) Other rating agencies limit all access to their ratings and research to
subscribers. The frequency with which a rating agency issues ratings also varies. Some
provide ratings on a periodic basis – the ratings are intended to reflect creditworthiness
only for a specified time period, after which a new rating must be issued. Others issue
ratings of indefinite duration, which are monitored on an ongoing basis and confirmed,
upgraded, or downgraded, if and when necessary.
The Commission studied several issues relating to the dissemination of
information by credit rating agencies, and possible improvements that might be
considered. The most significant of these are summarized below.
1.
Transparency of Ratings Process. At the Commission’s credit rating
agency hearings, representatives of users of securities ratings – particularly buy-side
firms – stressed the importance of transparency in the ratings process. In their view, the
marketplace needs to more fully understand the reasoning behind a ratings decision, and
the types of information relied upon by the rating agencies in their analysis. Better
information about rating decisions, they assert, would reduce the uncertainty, and
accompanying market volatility, that frequently surrounds a ratings change.86 Among
other things, users would like more information about the rating analyst’s key
assumptions or expectations regarding the issuer’s financial performance and industry
trends, as well as specific events or financial triggers that might prompt a reconsideration
of the rating. They would also like a list of the key documents reviewed as part of the
ratings process.87
A related concern arises as a result of the recent implementation by the
Commission of Regulation FD which, in very broad terms, prohibits selective disclosure
of nonpublic issuer information, but provides a conditional exception for rating
agencies. 88 Rating agencies commonly use nonpublic information in their analysis, such
86

See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (testimony of Cynthia L.
Strauss, Director of Taxable Bond Research, Fidelity Investments Money Management Inc. [hereinafter
“Strauss Testimony”]) (“[O]ne of the first things we wonder is what is it that they [the credit rating
agencies] know, and [to the extent what they know is unclear] I think that adds unnecessary volatility and
uncertainty to the marketplace.”).
87

See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (testimony of Deborah A.
Cunningham, Senior Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager [hereinafter “Cunningham Testimony”])
(“What we are paying for is the information that is key in understanding why their ratings are as they are.”)
and (Strauss Testimony) (“What makes a rating good is how well the agency analyzes the company, makes
an assessment, and clearly articulates that to the marketplace, so the marketplace can make its best
assessment of that.”).

33

as budgets and forecasts, financial statements on a stand-alone basis, and internal capital
allocations and contingent risks. While some observers have commented that a rating
agency’s access to nonpublic information improves the rating process89 and results in a
more informed and complete credit rating, 90 this access, in the context of Regulation FD,
has caused concern to others.91 Specifically, concerns have been expressed that the rating
agency exemption in Regulation FD may increase volatility and decrease transparency in
the market.92 When nonpublic information is used to develop a credit rating, rating
agencies attempt to convey the consequences of such information in their published
rating decision, without disclosing the nonpublic information itself or even the extent
nonpublic information factored into the ratings decision. Some are of the view that, to
the extent market participants must speculate as to whether nonpublic information was
used in the rating process and, if so, the relative importance placed upon it, market
uncertainty and volatility result.
Rating agency representatives generally agreed that users should understand the
reasoning behind a rating before relying on it, and described the information presently
made available in this regard.93 They also expressed a willingness to work with users to
offer additional information concerning their ratings analysis and decisions. 94

88

See supra note 60. In addition to the specific rating agency exemption in Regulation FD, rating
agencies may be able to avail themselves of the exemption for “persons who expressly agree to maintain
the disclosed information in confidence.”

89

See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (testimony of Malcolm S.
Macdonald, Vice President – Finance and Treasurer, Ford Motor Company [hereinafter “Macdonald
Testimony”]) (“[I]f we were required to observe FD with the [rating agencies], the quality of the rating for
the investors would undoubtedly go down, because there is no way that we would release confidential
product plans for future years and data of that type, which could be used by our competitors. So applying
the exemption from FD, I think, improves the rating process.”).
90

See, e.g., the Elsner Letter, supra note 40 (“Having access to the issuer and confidential
information at the time of issuance and on going, is one of the strengths of an NRSRO securities rating . . .
A rating agency that has access to key management or that has full access to critical underlying information
essential for issuing a rating, has the ability to produce an informed rating. Only such informed ratings
should be classified as ‘complete’ ratings to qualify for regulatory purposes.”).

91

See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (Strauss Testimony) (“[T]he fact
that the rating agencies have access to information that investors cannot have creates great concern for
us.”).

92

See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (Strauss Testimony) (“We don’t
have [nonpublic information,] and then we’re reliant, we the marketplace, on the rating agencies doing the
right thing with it. I just think it creates an uncomfortable imbalance which can also add volatility.”).

93

See generally SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (testimony of Leo C.
O’Neill, President, S&P [hereinafter “O’Neill Testimony”]), and (November 21, 2002) (testimony of
Raymond W. McDaniel, President, Moody’s [hereinafter “McDaniel Testimony”]).

94

See generally SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (O’Neill Testimony),
regarding S&P’s willingness to “go to work” on improving the transparency of its rating process.

34

Accordingly, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring whether
NRSROs should disclose more information about the key bases of, and assumptions
underlying, the ratings decision.
2.
Preferential Subscriber Access to Information. Some have expressed
concern regarding the special access of subscribers to rating agency information and
personnel. In the course of its study, the staff, among other things, examined: (a) whether
information concerning a rating action is made available to subscribers prior to the rating
being issued; and (b) the extent to which information concerning a rating is made
available to subscribers that is not available, or not available as readily or as soon, to the
public. As discussed above, those rating agencies that make ratings publicly available
(including the largest rating agencies) represent that the ratings themselves are available
to the public and subscribers at the same time.95 But additional, more extensive
information is provided to subscribers and, as a practical matter, many subscribers have
direct access to rating agency analysts for elaborative conversations.
Questions have been raised as to whether this preferential subscriber access to
important information about issuers and credit ratings creates an unfair information
asymmetry in the marketplace. 96 For example, analysts at credit rating agencies routinely
take calls from subscribers, and the existence of these informal contacts raises the
possibility of disclosure (intentional or inadvertent) of information concerning a rating
prior to its issuance, or regarding the timing or nature of a forthcoming rating change.
Selective disclosure of information regarding upcoming rating changes is particularly
troublesome, given the substantial market impact rating changes may have. In addition,
these contacts would appear to increase the risk of confidential issuer information being
disclosed.
The rating agencies note that they have policies and procedures to prevent these
problems. Typically, rating agencies have extensive internal rules that prohibit analysts
from communicating information regarding rating actions until the rating is publicly

95

See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 21, 2002) (testimony of Stephen W. Joynt,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Fitch [hereinafter “Joynt Testimony”]) (“Our ratings are public . . .
Any press releases we make and public announcements that we make are designed to provide sufficient
information to substantiate any rating we do, or any rating change we make.”) and (McDaniel Testimony)
(“Our press releases, which contain any rating changes and the rationale for rating changes . . . are made
available publicly on our website.”).

96

See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (Macdonald Testimony) (“[W]e
do find that we receive reports that personnel from the rating agencies have made comments to analysts,
investors, and others that they will not make publicly and they will not make to us, and I believe and I am
concerned that that can lead to serious distortions in the markets.”). Mr. Macdonald expressed additional
concern that an individual analyst’s views might not necessarily reflect those of the rating agency’s rating
committee – which controls the ratings decision – and that the potential exists for misleading subscribers
who communicate with the analyst.

35

released.97 In addition, analysts specifically are prohibited from discussing confidential
issuer information with anyone outside the appropriate departments at the rating agency.
Nevertheless, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring whether
NRSROs should prohibit (or severely restrict) direct contacts between rating analysts and
users of ratings, including subscribers.
3.
Public Availability of Ratings. Many are of the view that the ratings of an
NRSRO should be publicly available, at no charge, to assure wide availability of the
ratings and the opportunity for the marketplace to judge their credibility and reliability.
As noted in Section V below, is exploring whether NRSROs should publicly disseminate
their ratings on a widespread basis.
E.

Barriers to Entry into the Business of Acting as a Credit Rating
Agency – Measures Needed to Remove Such Barriers

For many years, market participants have voiced concerns about the concentration
of credit rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets, and whether inordinate barriers to
entry exist. There also has been substantial debate regarding the extent to which any
natural barriers to entry are augmented by the regulatory use of the NRSRO concept, and
the process of Commission recognition of NRSROs.
Technically, the barriers to entry into the business of acting as a credit rating
agency would appear to be quite small, given that through the internet, for example, one
can easily publish credit opinions to a worldwide audience at minimal cost.
Nevertheless, most agree that the barriers to building a successful rating agency that rates
a large number of issues, and is widely relied upon by market participants, are
substantially greater. Opinions differ regarding the critical elements for success in the
credit rating business (e.g., staff, experience, capital), and this leads to differing opinions
as to the precise nature and extent of the natural barriers to successful entry.
Nevertheless, in general terms, there is a widespread view that one of the most
significant natural barriers into the credit rating business is the current dominance of a
few highly-regarded, well-capitalized rating agencies that pioneered the industry many
decades ago. The business of issuing credit ratings on securities originated in the early
1900s and, until the mid-1970s, only a handful of firms (primarily the three current
NRSROs) issued credit ratings on securities. Since the mid-1970’s, however, there has
been a steady increase in the number of credit rating agencies operating in the U.S. and

97

With regard to issuers, analysts are often allowed to inform the issuer of concerns during the
course of the rating process, but with the caveat that the rating has not yet been finalized until it is settled
by a rating committee. Further, issuers are often provided with an opportunity to review a rating shortly
before it is released to ensure that the information contained in the draft report and/or press release is
factually correct and devoid of any confidential information used in developing the rating.

36

internationally, so that today it is estimated that there are more than 100 active credit
rating agencies worldwide.98
The recent growth in the number of firms operating as credit rating agencies
suggests a growing appetite among market participants for advice about credit quality,
and that new entrants are able to develop a following for their credit judgments. At the
same time, few would dispute that new entrants generally have been unable to evolve into
a substantial presence in the ratings industry. Many believe this is due primarily to the
longstanding dominance of the credit rating business by a few firms – essentially the
NRSROs – as well as the fact that the marketplace may not demand ratings from more
than two or three rating agencies.
As to the regulatory impact on rating agency competition, a wide range of
observers has criticized the regulatory use of the NRSRO concept – particularly the
“national recognition” requirement – as creating a substantial barrier to entry. In essence,
these critics contend that important users of securities ratings have a regulatory incentive
to obtain ratings issued by NRSROs, and that without NRSRO status new entrants
encounter great difficulties achieving the “national recognition” necessary to acquire the
NRSRO designation. In other words, new entrants are faced with something akin to a
“chicken and egg” problem in achieving NRSRO status, which they view as necessary or,
at a minimum, very important for becoming a substantial presence in the credit rating
industry.
For example, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), commenting on the
Commission’s 1997 rule proposal, opposed the use of the “national recognition”
requirement because, in its view, that criterion likely creates a “nearly insurmountable
barrier to new entry into the market for NRSRO services.”99 DOJ believed that, while the
historical dominance of Moody’s and S&P had eroded in recent years for certain types of
securities, the overall level of market power they retained continued to be a competitive
concern. To ameliorate entry barriers, DOJ suggested the Commission consider giving
“provisional” NRSRO status (for the first 12 to 18 months of existence) to newly-formed
credit rating affiliates of established, well-capitalized firms that have reputations for
quality financial analysis in the investment community (e.g., investment banks,
commercial banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, or accounting firms). DOJ
also recommended the Commission consider “provisional” NRSRO status for foreign
rating agencies, and indicated they might initially specialize in rating U.S. companies
with substantial operations abroad.

98

See Basel Study, supra note 69, at 14 (“[I]n September 1999, it was believed that there might be
some 130 [rating] agencies world-wide, although industry sources indicated this number was closer to
150.”). See also SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (testimony of Gay Huey
Evans, Director, Markets and Exchanges Division, The Financial Services Authority) (“There are
[approximately] 150 [rating] agencies in total around the world and they vary in size and scope.”).
99

See Comments of the United States Department of Justice in the Matter of: File No. S7-33-97
Proposed Amendments to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (March 6, 1998).

37

In the course of the Commission’s study, NRSRO representatives generally took
the position that, while NRSRO status might have some marginal impact on their
business, its effect was not substantial. Representatives from certain non-NRSRO rating
agencies, on the other hand, were of the view that lack of NRSRO status substantially
hindered their businesses’ rate of growth.100 In their view, NRSRO status is of great
significance, not only because the concept permeates financial regulation, but also
because the marketplace views the NRSRO designation as the equivalent of the “Good
Housekeeping Seal Of Approval.”101
Users of credit ratings and others point out, however, that there must be
substantive threshold standards for achieving NRSRO status for that term to have
meaning.102 In essence, the NRSRO designation is meant to reflect the fact that the
marketplace views a rating agency’s ratings as credible and reliable. Without such an
assurance as to the quality of the ratings issued by a rating agency, it would be foolhardy
to rely upon ratings as a proxy for credit quality in regulation. Furthermore, any
regulatory barriers to entry have not proved to be insurmountable. Since the mid-1970s,
several rating agencies have been able to enter the credit rating business and achieve the
requisite level of market recognition to be designated NRSROs.103 And there are several
additional applications for NRSRO designation currently under review by Commission
staff.

100

See, e.g., SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 21, 2002) (testimony of Barron H.
Putnam, Ph.D., President and Financial Economist, LACE Financial Corp.) (“When Thomson BankWatch
received NRSRO status . . . our company just stopped growing, and we really haven’t grown much since
that time.”). However, see also SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (testimony of
Sean J. Egan, President, Egan-Jones Ratings Co.) (Mr. Egan, responding to a question on whether it is
difficult to expand his firm without being recognized as an NRSRO, stated, “[I]t’s possible to establish
yourself in the market, to grow [your] firm, to get the critical mass, to have a sustainable operation.”).

101

See, e.g., SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 21, 2002) (testimony of Larry G.
Mayewski, Executive Vice President and Chief Ratings Officer, Ratings Division, The A.M. Best
Company) (“Clearly, the lack of an NRSRO designation has had some impact . . . [O]verall, issuers look at
[NRSRO] designation as a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.”).
102

See, e.g., SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (testimony of Frank A.
Fernandez, Senior Vice President, Chief Economist and Director of Research, The Securities Industry
Association [hereinafter “Fernandez Testimony”]) (“I think there are some very high barriers to entry with
respect to the NRSRO designation. Some of them I believe are natural, some I believe are necessary”) and
(testimony of Gregory A. Root, Executive Vice President, Dominion Bond Rating Service Limited) (“I
think the barriers to entry need to be high as long as there is going to be an NRSRO designation and ratings
are going to play the role they do. They need to be high. Not insurmountable, but high.”).
103

Duff & Phelps, Inc. began issuing credit ratings in 1974 and became an NRSRO in 1982.
McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei began issuing credit ratings in 1975 and became an NRSRO by 1983. IBCA
Limited and IBCA Inc. began issuing credit ratings in 1978 and 1985, respectively, and were designated
together as an NRSRO in 1990. Thomson BankWatch, Inc. entered the credit rating business in 1974 and
became an NRSRO in 1991. As discussed in Section II, however, each of these NRSROs subsequently was
acquired by or merged into another NRSRO, with the result that today there remain only three NRSROs.

38

Nevertheless, in the course of the Commission’s examination, there appeared to
be substantial support – even from the existing NRSROs104 – for efforts to improve
competition in the credit rating industry. Some have suggested that one clear way to
remove any regulatory barriers to competition is to eliminate the use of the NRSRO
concept in regulation. One view, for example, is that credit spreads could be a viable
substitute for credit ratings in financial regulation.105 But others believe that the volatility
of credit spreads, their backward-looking nature, and the fact that their use would be
limited to liquid securities, make them an inferior alternative to credit ratings.106 As
noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring whether there are viable
alternatives to the NRSRO concept in Commission rules and regulations.
Many believe that rating agencies that focus on a specific sector of the debt
market should be able to achieve NRSRO recognition.107 As previously noted, rating
agencies often enter the business by focusing on a particular segment of the debt markets.
Allowing them to demonstrate national recognition of their sectoral expertise in order to
become an NRSRO, therefore, could stimulate competition in the credit rating industry.
Accordingly, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring whether it should
expressly permit NRSROs that cover a limited sector of the debt market to achieve
NRSRO designation.108 The Commission also is exploring the appropriateness of

competition, and I do see a role for other rating agencies.”) See also Written Statement of The Bond
Market Association, SEC Hearing on Credit Rating Agencies (November 21, 2002) (“[W]e believe that the
Commission should undertake the [NRSRO] designation process with a view to promoting competition by
designating additional organizations, consistent with prudent application of the regulatory standards.”).

Rating Agencies, 77 Wash.U.L.Q. 619 (1999). Professor Partnoy suggests that money market mutual

less, and be required to sell bonds whose credit spread increased above 75 basis points for some period of
time. Id. at 706.

See, e.g., SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (Fernandez Testimony)

may be wrong on any given day about the long-term fundamental value, the probability of default or
ultimate recovery value of any security.”) and (November 21, 2002) (testimony of Paul Saltzman,

Two of the seven firms previously recognized as NRSROs were recognized on a limited purpose
basis. In a letter dated November 27, 1990, to Mr. Robin Monro-Davies, President of IBCA Limited, the

recognizing as an NRSRO a rating agency that confines its activity to a limited
geographic area.
In addition, the Commission’s process of recognizing NRSROs has come under
criticism for being opaque and lengthy. If this process were to be clarified and
streamlined, perhaps rating agencies could achieve NRSRO status more readily, thereby
promoting competition in the credit rating industry. Some rating agencies that have been
reviewed by Commission staff for purposes of achieving NRSRO status complain that,
while the general criteria reviewed by the staff and referenced in applicable no-action
letters are well-known, it is unclear how Commission staff conducts its assessment, and
exactly what is needed to demonstrate satisfaction of the general criteria. For example,
there appears to be confusion as to the types of evidence of national recognition the staff
finds persuasive, and the minimum levels of staffing and financial resources that are
required. In addition, some NRSRO applicants have expressed concern over the length
of time it takes Commission staff to evaluate them and reach a conclusion on their
applications. Accordingly, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring
possible clarifications of the NRSRO criteria, as well as instituting timing goals for the
evaluation of NRSRO applications.

Conflicts of Interest in the Operation of Credit Rating Agencies –
Measures to Address Such Conflicts

Potential conflicts of interest have existed in the credit rating business for many
years and, as mentioned in Section III.B.2. above, the Commission has reviewed the
impact of certain of these potential conflicts in the past.109 Many are of the view,
however, that the potential conflicts of interest faced by credit rating agencies have
increased in recent years, particularly given the expansion of large credit rating agencies
into ancillary advisory and other businesses, and the continued rise in importance of
rating agencies in the U.S. securities markets. Two of the most significant potential
conflicts of interest, which were a focus of the Commission’s study, are discussed below.
Commission’s Division of Market Regulation stated that it would not recommend enforcement action to the
Commission against broker-dealers that considered IBCA Limited and its subsidiary, IBCA Inc., together,
as an NRSRO for purposes of the Net Capital Rule, in the case of debt issued by banks, bank holding
companies, United Kingdom building societies, broker-dealers, and broker-dealers’ parent companies, as
well as bank-supported debt. Similarly, by letter dated August 6, 1991, the Division of Market Regulation
informed Mr. Gregory A. Root, then President of Thomson BankWatch, Inc. (“BankWatch”), that it would
not recommend enforcement action against broker-dealers that considered BankWatch as an NRSRO for
purposes of the Net Capital Rule, in the case of debt issued by banks, bank holding companies, non-bank
banks, thrifts, broker-dealers, and broker-dealers’ parent companies. On January 25, 1999, however, the
Division of Market Regulation granted the request of BankWatch to be considered by broker-dealers as an
NRSRO for its ratings of all debt securities. See Letter from Michael A. Macchiaroli, Associate Director,
Division of Market Regulation, SEC, to Lee Pickard, Esq., Pickard and Djinis LLP (January 25, 1999).
109

In both the 1994 Concept Release and the 1997 Proposing Release, for example, the Commission
solicited comment on the practice of NRSROs charging issuers for ratings, and basing their fees on the size
of the transaction. Among other things, concerns had been expressed that a rating agency might be tempted
to give a more favorable rating to a large issue because of the large fee, and to encourage the issuer to
submit future large issues to the rating agency. See supra note 38.

1.
Issuers Paying for Ratings. Concerns have been expressed for a number
of years about the potential conflict of interest that arises from the fact that the largest
credit rating agencies rely on issuer fees for the vast majority of their revenues.110
Historically, rating agencies were financed solely by subscription fees paid by investors
and other users of credit ratings. By the mid-1970s, however, the largest rating agencies
began charging issuers for ratings, due to difficulties in limiting access to ratings
information to subscribers, as well as to the demand for more comprehensive and
resource-intensive analysis of issuers. In general, the fees that rating agencies charge
issuers are based on the size of the issuance and the nature of the instrument being rated.
They typically include both a fee for the initial rating and an annual maintenance fee.
The fees are not regulated and vary only slightly among the larger rating agencies. In
some cases, the rating agencies will discount the fees for frequent issuers or negotiate flat
rate fees.
The practice of issuers paying for their own ratings creates the potential for a
conflict of interest.111 Arguably, the dependence of rating agencies on revenues from the
companies they rate could induce them to rate issuers more liberally, and temper their
diligence in probing for negative information. This potential conflict could be
exacerbated by the rating agencies’ practice of charging fees based on the size of the
issuance, as large issuers could be given inordinate influence with the rating agencies.
The large rating agencies and a number of other market participants agree that the
issuer-fee model creates the potential for a conflict of interest, but believe that the rating
agencies historically have demonstrated an ability to effectively manage that potential
conflict.112 As an initial matter, the rating agencies that rely on issuer fees downplay the
significance of this potential conflict by pointing out that fees received from individual
issuers are a very small percentage of their total revenues,113 so that no single issuer has
material economic influence with a rating agency. Furthermore, the rating agencies
110

See, e.g., SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 21, 2002) (McDaniel Testimony)
(“About 90 percent [of Moody’s research service revenues] comes from issuers who pay fees for ratings,
and about 10 percent comes from [Moody’s] research and data services.”) and (Joynt Testimony) (“90
percent [of Fitch’s revenues] come from issuer fees, and around 10 percent come from subscription
services.”).
111

A related potential conflict could arise in the context of underwriters attempting to influence the
credit rating process. A large percentage of bond offerings are underwritten by a few large firms, and the
potential exists for rating agencies to rate a particular underwriter’s clients more favorably in return for
future business.
112

Notably, a recent Senate Committee staff report concluded that Moody’s November 8, 2001
decision not to downgrade Enron’s credit rating below investment grade was not based on improper
influence or pressure, but on new information presented by financial institutions and others that in Moody’s
view changed Enron’s circumstances. See supra note 53.
113

For example, S&P stated that no single issuer or issuer group represents more than approximately
2% of the total annual revenue of its ratings business.

41

assert that their reputation for issuing credible and reliable ratings is critical to their
business, and that they would be loathe to jeopardize that reputation by allowing issuers
to improperly influence their ratings, or by otherwise failing to be diligent and objective
in their rating assessments. Finally, the rating agencies note their extensive policies and
procedures regarding analyst compensation are designed to prevent potential interference
with the objectivity of the analyst’s assessment of an issuer.114
Nevertheless, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring whether
NRSROs should implement procedures to manage potential conflicts of interest that arise
when issuers paying for ratings.
2.
Development of Ancillary Businesses. In recent years, the large rating
agencies have begun developing ancillary businesses to complement their core ratings
business. These businesses include ratings assessment services where, for an additional
fee, issuers present hypothetical scenarios to the rating agencies to determine how their
ratings would be affected by a proposed corporate action (e.g., a merger, asset sale, or
stock repurchase).115 They also include risk management and consulting services.116
The development of these ancillary businesses creates another potential conflict of
interest for rating agencies. Concerns have been expressed that credit rating decisions
might be impacted by whether or not an issuer purchases additional services offered by
the credit rating agency. In fact, some have argued that this potential conflict is
analogous to that of accounting firms offering consulting services, or research analysts

114

In general, the large rating agencies represented that rating analysts do not solicit new business
and have no direct financial interest in the outcome of their ratings. In addition, they assert that the
compensation of their rating analysts is merit-based (i.e., based on the demonstrated reliability of their
ratings), and is not directly dependent on the fees paid by particular issuers.
115

Each of the NRSROs currently offers rating assessment services. S&P has offered its “Ratings
Evaluation Service” since 1997; Moody’s formalized its comparable “Rating Assessment Service” in 2000;
and Fitch began offering its “Ratings Assessment Service” in 2002. Representatives from the NRSROs
indicated that revenues from their rating assessment services were nominal compared with ratings-related
revenues. See, e.g., SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 21, 2002) (McDaniel Testimony)
(“The rating assessment service that we run is . . . about 1 percent of our revenues in the last year”) and
(Joynt Testimony) (“We have a very limited rating assessment service. We only actually introduced this
service within the last nine months.”). There are indications, however, that revenues from rating
assessment services are becoming more substantial. See, e.g., McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. 2001 Form
10-K Annual Report (“[S&P’s] revenue from rating evaluation services . . . increased substantially during
2000.”).
116

For example, Fitch operates “Fitch Risk Management,” Moody’s operates “Moody’s Risk
Management Services,” and S&P operates “Risk Solutions.” Each of these groups provide products and
services intended to help financial institutions and other companies manage credit and operational risk.
Products and services offered include public and private firm credit scoring models, internal ratings
systems services, and empirical data on default incidence, loss severity, default correlations, and rating
transitions.

42

seeking investment banking business.117 In addition, some believe that, whether or not
the purchase of ancillary services actually impacts the credit rating decision, issuers may
be pressured into using them out of fear that their failure to do so could adversely impact
their credit rating (or, conversely, with the expectation that purchasing these services
could help their credit rating). Furthermore, in the case of ratings assessment services,
there are concerns that, to the extent a rating agency has already “promised” a certain
rating to an issuer’s hypothetical scenario, pressure to match the actual rating to the
promised rating is likely to be forceful, even if the ultimate analysis otherwise might not
have supported the rating.
The rating agencies that offer ancillary services point out that they have
established extensive policies and procedures to manage potential conflicts in this area,
including substantial firewalls that separate the ratings business from the influence of
ancillary businesses. Rating analysts generally do not participate in the marketing of
ancillary services;118 separate staffs typically are maintained to perform this function.
Furthermore, the compensation of rating analysts is not directly dependent on the
performance of the ancillary businesses. In the case of ratings assessment services, the
rating agencies assert that there is no guarantee associated with that service, and that the
ultimate credit rating is not driven by the assessment. Finally, the rating agencies note
that, at present, ancillary services are an insignificant aspect of their businesses,
generating a very small percentage of total revenues, so that the potential conflicts of
interest are immaterial.
Nevertheless, as noted in Section V below, the Commission is exploring whether
NRSROs should implement procedures to manage potential conflicts of interest that arise
when credit rating agencies develop ancillary businesses.119
V.

CONCLUSION

As a result of the study of credit rating agencies described in this Report, the
Commission has identified a wide range of issues that deserve further examination.
Accordingly, the Commission plans to publish a concept release within 60 days of this
Report to address concerns related to credit rating agencies and expects to issue proposed
rules, after reviewing and evaluating the comments received on the concept release,
117

See, e.g., Letter from Sean J. Egan and W. Bruce Jones, Egan-Jones Ratings Company, to
Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (November 10, 2002) (“Separate ratings from consulting – just as
accountants were compromised by their consulting assignments, ratings firms have similar issues.”).
118

In the case of rating assessment services, however, the rating analysts actually will perform the
ancillary assessments. In addition, at the Commission’s hearings, one buy-side participant indicated that
she was aware of at least one instance in which analysts from a rating agency were involved in marketing
advisory services to her firm. See SEC Hearing Transcript, supra note 57 (November 15, 2002) (Strauss
Testimony).
119

Research analysts at investment banking firms recently have become subject to rules imposing
restrictions on their activities and compensation.

43

within a reasonable period of time after the close of the comment period.120 The
Commission hopes to elicit extensive comments on these issues, from market
participants, other regulators, and the public at large.
A.

Information Flow

1.
The Commission will explore whether NRSROs should disclose more
information about the key bases of, and assumptions underlying, the ratings decision.
2.
The Commission will explore whether NRSROs should publicly
disseminate their ratings on a widespread basis.
3.
The Commission will explore whether NRSROs that issue unsolicited
ratings should clearly indicate that fact on any such rating.
4.
The Commission will explore whether there should be improvements to
the extent and quality of disclosure by issuers, including disclosures relating to the
existence and impact of ratings triggers, conditional elements of important financial
contracts, short-term credit facilities, special purpose entities, and material future
liabilities.
B.

Potential Conflicts of Interest

1.
The Commission will explore whether NRSROs should implement
procedures to manage potential conflicts of interest that arise when issuers pay for
ratings.
2.
The Commission will explore whether NRSROs should prohibit (or
severely restrict) direct contacts between rating analysts and subscribers.

3.
The Commission will explore whether NRSROs should implement
procedures to manage potential conflicts of interest that arise when rating agencies
develop ancillary fee-based businesses.
C.

Alleged Anticompetitive or Unfair Practices

1.
The Commission will explore the extent to which allegations of
anticompetitive or unfair practices by large credit rating agencies have merit and, if so,
possible Commission action to address them.

120

The Commission is mindful that some of the concepts discussed in this report may raise questions
about the limits of the Commission’s authority. We will, of course, consider those issues carefully.

44

D.

Reducing Potential Regulatory Barriers to Entry

1.
The Commission will explore possible clarifications of the current
NRSRO recognition criteria.
2.
The Commission will explore instituting timing goals for the evaluation of
NRSRO applications.
3.
The Commission will explore whether it should expressly permit NRSROs
that cover a limited sector of the debt market to achieve NRSRO recognition.
4.
The Commission will explore whether it should permit a rating agency
that confines its activity to a limited geographic area to achieve NRSRO recognition.
5.
The Commission will explore whether there are viable alternatives to the
NRSRO concept in Commission rules and regulations.
E.

Ongoing Oversight

1.
The Commission will explore whether more direct, ongoing oversight of
NRSROs is warranted (e.g., recordkeeping requirements and regular examinations) and,
if so, will explore appropriate means for doing so.
2.
If such additional oversight is warranted, the Commission will explore
whether it is advisable to ask Congress for specific legislative oversight authority.
3.
The Commission will explore whether NRSROs should incorporate
general standards of diligence in performing their ratings analysis, and with respect to the
training and qualifications of credit rating analysts.
