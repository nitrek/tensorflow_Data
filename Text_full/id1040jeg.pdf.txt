INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
AS TO FOUR RESPONDENTS
July 27, 2016

APPEARANCE:

David S. Frye for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents
Anoteros, Inc., Emperial Americas, Inc., Nord Resources Corporation, and UNR Holdings, Inc.
(the Four Respondents).1 The revocation is based on the Four Respondents’ failures to timely
file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On June 15, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding under Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with an order instituting administrative proceedings (OIP). The
OIP alleges that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission under Exchange
Act Section 12(g) and have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission,
in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
Respondents were served with the OIP by June 20, 2016, and their answers were due by July 5.
Advanced Life Scis. Holdings, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3965, 2016 SEC LEXIS
2350 (ALJ July 6, 2016). On July 6, 2016, I noted that the Four Respondents had not filed
answers and ordered them to show cause by July 18, 2016, why the registrations of their
1

Advanced Life Sciences Holdings, Inc., has filed an answer and a summary disposition
schedule has been set as to that respondent. Advanced Life Scis. Holdings, Inc., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 4008, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2494 (ALJ July 20, 2016). Therefore, this initial
decision does not apply to Advanced Life.

securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file answers or otherwise
defend the proceeding. Id. The Four Respondents did not attend the telephonic prehearing
conference held on July 20, 2016, and to date have not filed answers or responded to the show
cause order. See Advanced Life Scis. Holdings, Inc., 2016 SEC LEXIS 2494.

FINDINGS OF FACT
The Four Respondents are in default for failing to file answers, attend the prehearing
conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2),
.220(f), .221(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I
find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Anoteros, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1390292, is a revoked Nevada corporation
located in Rolling Hills, California, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2014, which reported a net loss of $557,235 for the prior nine months. As
of June 8, 2016, the company’s common stock was quoted on OTC Link, had five market
makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
Emperial Americas, Inc., CIK No. 1424718, is a dissolved Florida corporation located in
Sarasota, Florida, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission,
having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30,
2012, which reported a net loss of $114,941 for the prior six months. As of June 8, 2016, the
company’s common stock was quoted on OTC Link, had six market makers, and was eligible for
the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
Nord Resources Corporation, CIK No. 72316, is a void Delaware corporation located in
Tucson, Arizona, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission,
having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended September
30, 2013, which reported a net loss of $6,455,500 for the prior nine months. On October 15,
2015, the company filed a Chapter 11 petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Arizona, which was closed on February 23, 2016. As of June 8, 2016, the company’s common
stock was quoted on OTC Link, had six market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback”
exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
UNR Holdings, Inc., CIK No. 1093800, is a delinquent Colorado corporation located in
New York, New York, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2012. As of June 8, 2016, the company’s common stock was quoted on
OTC Link, had four market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange
Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).

In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, the Four Respondents
failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failures to
maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250,
1268 (D.D.C. 1978). The Four Respondents failed to file timely periodic reports. As a result,
The Four Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and
13a-13.

SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will ensure that investors
are adequately protected, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of
the issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability
involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future
compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway
Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May
31, 2006).
The Four Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because the
failures constitute violations of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). The Four
Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports.
See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at
*20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year
period); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26
3

(May 23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period
considered recurrent). The Four Respondents are also culpable because they failed to heed
delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance or, through their failures
to maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did
not receive such letters. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC
LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even
without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally, the Four
Respondents have not answered the OIP, appeared at the prehearing conference, responded to the
show cause order, or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address whether they have made
any efforts to remedy their past violations. They have also made no assurances against further
violations.
For the reasons described above, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of the Four Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Anoteros, Inc., Emperial Americas, Inc.,
Nord Resources Corporation, and UNR Holdings, Inc., are hereby REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
