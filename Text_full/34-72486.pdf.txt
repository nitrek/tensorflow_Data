In the Matter of

LLC, and William L. Mello
Respondents.

EXTENSION ORDER

:
The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a second extension of time,
until September 25, 2014, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In its first request, the Division stated that since the issuance of the
Commission’s September 10, 2012, Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions1 (“Order”)
against JP Turner and Company, LLC (“JP Turner”) and its former president, William L.
Mello, for their failure to establish policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect the
churning of customers’ accounts, the Division had learned that some of the customers harmed
by the violations described in the Order had entered into private arbitrations with JP Turner.
The Commission granted the request and issued an Order extending the time to submit a
proposed Plan of Distribution to May 15, 2013.2 The Division now is requesting a second
extension because additional time is needed for further evaluation, analysis, and consultation to
properly account for settlements reached by JP Turner with some of the customers harmed by
the violations described in the Order, as the Division expects that such settlements will affect

the Division’s distribution. Furthermore, additional monies may be available for
distribution as a result of a related, ongoing litigated administrative proceeding against four
individual respondents. Additional time is needed for further evaluation, analysis, and
consultation in order to determine the impact of the related case on the proposed
distribution.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until September 25, 2014 to submit a proposed Plan of
Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Deputy Secretary
