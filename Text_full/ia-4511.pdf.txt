SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Hearing or Notification of Hearing
An order will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may
request a hearing by writing to the Commission’s Secretary. Hearing requests should be
received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on September 19, 2016. Pursuant to rule 0-5 under the
Advisers Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer’s interest, any facts bearing

The Commission intends to issue an order under the Advisers Act. 1
I.

Background
The Commission adopted the SEC Pay to Play Rule [17 CFR 275.206(4)-5] under the

Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. 80b] to prohibit an investment adviser from providing advisory services
for compensation to a government client for two years after the adviser or certain of its
executives or employees (“covered associates”) make a contribution to certain elected officials or
candidates. 2 Rule 206(4)-5 also prohibits an adviser and its covered associates from providing or
agreeing to provide, directly or indirectly, payment to any third-party for a solicitation of
advisory business from any government entity on behalf of such adviser, unless such third-party
is a “regulated person” (“third-party solicitor ban”). 3 Rule 206(4)-5 defines a “regulated person”

as an SEC-registered investment adviser, 4 a registered broker or dealer subject to pay to play
restrictions adopted by a registered national securities association that prohibit members from
engaging in distribution or solicitation activities if certain political contributions have been
made, 5 or a registered municipal advisor subject to pay to play restrictions adopted by the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”) that prohibit members from engaging in
distribution or solicitation activities if certain political contributions have been made. 6 In
addition, in order for a broker-dealer or municipal advisor to be a regulated person under rule
206(4)-5, the Commission must find, by order, that these pay to play rules: (i) impose
substantially equivalent or more stringent restrictions on broker-dealers or municipal advisors
than the SEC Pay to Play Rule imposes on investment advisers; and (ii) are consistent with the
objectives of the SEC Pay to Play Rule. 7
Rule 206(4)-5 became effective on September 13, 2010 and the compliance date for the
third-party solicitor ban was set to September 13, 2011. 8 When the Commission added
municipal advisors to the definition of regulated person, the Commission also extended the thirdparty solicitor ban’s compliance date to June 13, 2012. 9 In the absence of a final municipal
advisor registration rule, the Commission extended the third-party solicitor ban’s compliance

See 17 CFR 275.206(4)-5(f)(9)(ii). While rule 206(4)-5 applies to any registered national securities
association, FINRA is currently the only registered national securities association under section 19(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78s(b)] (the “Exchange Act”). As such, for convenience, we
will refer directly to FINRA in this Notice when describing the exception for certain broker-dealers from
the third-party solicitor ban.

July 31, 2015. 11 On June 25, 2015, the Commission issued notice of the July 31, 2015
compliance date. 12
On December 16, 2015, FINRA filed with the Commission the proposed rule change
relating to the FINRA Pay to Play Rule, which the Commission published for notice and
comment in the Federal Register on December 30, 2015 pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the
Exchange Act and rule 19b-4 thereunder. 13 The Commission received ten comment letters, from
nine different commenters, in response to the FINRA Pay to Play Rule Notice. On February 8,
2016, FINRA extended the time period by which the Commission must approve or disapprove
the FINRA Pay to Play Rule or institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or
disapprove the rule change to March 29, 2016. On March 28, 2016, FINRA filed a letter with
the Commission stating that it had considered the comments received by the Commission in
response to the FINRA Pay to Play Rule Notice and that FINRA is not intending to make
changes to the proposed rule text in response to comments received. On March 29, 2016,
pursuant to delegated authority, the Commission published an order instituting proceedings

On June 25, 2015, the Division of Investment Management published an FAQ that provides that the
Division would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against any investment adviser or
its covered associates for the payment to any third person to solicit a government entity for investment
advisory services until the later of (i) the effective date of the FINRA Pay to Play Rule or (ii) the effective
date of a pay to play rule adopted by the MSRB. See http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/pay-to-playfaq.htm#1.4.

under section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act to determine whether to approve or disapprove
the FINRA Pay to Play Rule, and solicited additional comment. The Commission received an
additional four comments in response to the order instituting proceedings. On July 6, 2016,
FINRA submitted a letter responding to all comments and to the order instituting proceedings.
After considering the proposed rule change, the comments received and FINRA’s responses to
the comments, the Commission issued an order on August 25, 2016, approving the proposed rule
change pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. 14

Discussion of Order
Pursuant to section 206 of the Advisers Act and rule 206(4)-5(f)(9)(ii)(B) thereunder,

the Commission is providing notice 15 that the Commission intends to issue an order finding
that the FINRA Pay to Play Rule (i) imposes substantially equivalent or more stringent
restrictions on brokers-dealers than the SEC Pay to Play Rule imposes on investment advisers
and (ii) is consistent with the objectives of the SEC Pay to Play Rule. The FINRA Pay to Play
Rule imposes substantially similar requirements for its member firms as the SEC Pay to Play
Rule imposes on investment advisers. For example, the FINRA Pay to Play Rule:
•

Prohibits a covered member from engaging in distribution or solicitation activities
for compensation with a government entity on behalf of an investment adviser that
provides or is seeking to provide investment advisory services to such government
entity within two years after a contribution to an official of the government entity is
made by the covered member or a covered associate (including a person who

becomes a covered associate within two years or, under certain circumstances, six
months after the contribution is made); 16
•

Prohibits a covered member or covered associate from coordinating or soliciting
any person or political action committee to make any (i) contribution to an official
of a government entity in respect of which the covered member is engaging in, or
seeking to engage in, distribution or solicitation activities on behalf of an
investment adviser or (ii) payment to a political party of a state or locality of a
government entity with which the covered member is engaging in, or seeking to
engage in, distribution or solicitation activities on behalf of an investment adviser; 17

•

Provides that it shall be a violation of the rules for any covered member or any of its
covered associates to do anything indirectly that, if done directly, would result in a
violation of the rule; 18

•

Provides that a covered member that engages in distribution or solicitation activities
with a government entity on behalf of a covered investment pool in which a
government entity invests or is solicited to invest shall be treated as though the
covered member was engaging in or seeking to engage in distribution or solicitation
activities with the government entity on behalf of the investment adviser to the
covered investment pool directly; and 19

•

Provides exceptions under, and an exemption provision in respect of, the rule
similar to those in rule 206(4)-5. 20

The Commission believes that the rule imposes substantially equivalent or more
stringent restrictions on broker-dealers than rule 206(4)-5 imposes on investment advisers and
would be consistent with the objectives of rule 206(4)-5.
By the Commission.

records related to the FINRA Pay to Play Rule.
