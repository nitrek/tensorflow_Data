In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time, until
March 6, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution pursuant to Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In its request, the Division states that since the issuance of the Commission’s July 17,
2012, Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings pursuant to Sections
203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order against Centaur
Management Co. LLC (“Centaur”) finding that Centaur willfully violated Sections 206(2) and
206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 promulgated thereunder, the Division has began
to assess the feasibility of distribution. The Division requires additional time to continue to
deliberate the feasibility of a distribution and, if necessary, to develop a plan methodology,
draft a proposed Plan of Distribution, and have a fund administrator appointed by the
Commission.

Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until March, 6, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of
Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
