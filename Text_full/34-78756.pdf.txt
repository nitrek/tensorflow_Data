ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION
15(b) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934, AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
ROBERT D. MILLIGAN,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Robert D. Milligan
(“Respondent” or “Milligan”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
1.
From April 2008 until June 2010, Milligan was associated with North Global
Securities, Inc., a registered broker-dealer. Milligan, age 52, is a resident of Robinson, Texas.
2.
On July 20, 2016, a judgment was entered by consent against Milligan,
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5 and 17(a) of the Securities Act of
1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in the
civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Robert DeWayne Milligan, Civil
Action No. 2:15-cv-07308-AB-AGR, in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California.
3.
The Commission’s complaint alleged that between May 2010 and May 2014, in
connection with the sale of securities, Milligan misused and misappropriated investor funds, made
material misstatements and omissions regarding, among other things, his use of investor funds and
the status of various purported oil and gas drilling projects, and otherwise engaged in a variety of
conduct which operated as a fraud and deceit on investors. The complaint also alleged that
Milligan unlawfully sold unregistered securities.

III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act; and
C.
Whether, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, it is appropriate and in
the public interest to bar Milligan from participating in any offering of penny stock, including:
acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a
broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock; or inducing or
attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.
IV.
