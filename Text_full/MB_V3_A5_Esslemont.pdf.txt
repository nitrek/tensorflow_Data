Telephone Directories as Sampling Frames
Don Esslemont, Susan Petersen and K S Selvakumar

Of 1000 respondents in a face-to-face survey, 22% did not live in households listed in telephone
directories, and therefore could not have been included in a sample using telephone directories as a
sampling frame. Those not listed were significantly younger, more likely to be never married,
separated, or divorced, and were more likely to live in the northern part of New Zealand.
Keywords: telephone survey, sampling frame, non response bias

Introduction
There are three main methods of collecting survey data: face-to-face interviews, mail surveys
and telephone surveys. Traditionally, telephone surveys were considered to be biased because
of the low incidence of telephone ownership. But, due to the high level of telephone
ownership in NewZealand today (95% of households), advances in telecommunications
technology, and the potential for substantial cost savings, telephone surveys have become
very attractive to buyers of research.
In telephone surveys, three main sampling frames are commonly used: the telephone
directory, random digit dialling, and specifically compiled lists. In New Zealand, the most
commonly used sampling frame for telephone surveys is the telephone directory. To date,
however, no studies of the accuracy or reliability of the telephone directories as sampling
frames have been conducted here.
The Telephone Directory
The use of telephone directory as a sampling frame results in three major sources of bias:
exclusion of non-telephone households, exclusion of telephone numbers that are issued after
the publication of the telephone directory, and exclusion of unlisted numbers.
Earlier research, mainly in the United States, into bias resulting from using telephone
directories as sampling frames, focused on the characteristics of telephone owners and nontelephone owners. Leuthold and Scheele (1971) found that people living in rural areas and
those on low incomes were less likely to own telephones than those living in urban areas with
higher incomes. Tyebjee (1979) found this difference in telephone ownership often resulted
in over-representation of households with certain geographic and demographic characteristics
when telephone directories were used as sampling frames. Hyett and Allan (1976) also noted
that the telephone owners were more affluent than the general population.
Some of this bias is attributable to out-of-date listings. Cooper (1964) estimated that the
proportion of subscribers not listed in the telephone directory at the end of the year amounted
to 18% in United States. Blankenship (1977a) estimated that if 20% of families move
annually, then the average listings of non-current names will be around 10%.
A major source of bias in recent times is the increasing use of unlisted telephone numbers.
Leuthold and Scheele (1971) found that 9% of their respondents had unlisted telephone

numbers. Brunner and Brunner (1971) and Frankel and Frankel (1977) questioned whether
the characteristics of the unlisted telephone owners are different from listed telephone
owners.
Cooper (1964) stated that persons whose numbers are unlisted may represent, at least in part,
higher income levels and greater educational accomplishment, such as lawyers, physicians,
entertainers and other public personalities. In contrast, Leuthold and Scheele (1971) found
that unlisted numbers average income and education levels were similar for listed and
unlisted populations.
Moberg (1982) stated that if unlisted numbers are systematically excluded, the resulting
sample would consist of people somewhat older, more rural, more white, more educated,
more retired and more white collar than the households with telephone service.
The potential for bias has prompted several commentators to suggest that, in the United
States at least, telephone directories are not adequate sampling frames (Cooper, 1964;
Brunner & Brunner, 1971; Roslow & Roslow, 1972; Glasser & Metzger, 1972, 1975;
Blankenship, 1977b; Tyebjee, 1979; Moberg, 1982). However, in spite of their deficiencies,
the convenience of telephone directories in both hard copy and computer tape versions points
towards continued reliance upon them. Furthermore, not all of the evidence weighs against
their use.
For example, Leuthold and Scheele (1971) suggest that, for some specialised surveys, the
telephone directory may be relatively unbiased, while Rich (1977) concludes that, for some
studies, samples which include only listed subscribers may be adequate and are not different
from those of the total subscriber population. Rich suggests that the choice of sampling
frames should be made according to the objective of the survey.
Furthermore, Sudman (1973) concludes that directories are not only higher in quality, but less
expensive than methods that use random dialling or door to door listing exclusively. He
thinks that in certain areas, when the fraction of unlisted telephone is less than 5%, directories
are perfectly adequate frames. In other areas, a combination of random digit dialling and the
use of telephone directory is preferable.
Clearly; the possibility of bias is an important consideration when selecting a survey
sampling frame, and the reliability of New Zealand telephone directories as sampling frames
deserves investigation. The purpose of this study was twofold: (i) to measure the accuracy of
telephone directories in obtaining a representative sample of the general population and (ii),
to determine the proportion of households who had no chance of inclusion in a sample drawn
from telephone directory.

Method
A market research company in New Zealand supplied names, addresses and telephone
numbers from an omnibus survey. The sample consisted of 1000 respondents selected
nationally. Although there may have been differences between the achieved sample and the
New Zealand population, the company concerned is known to sample carefully and to insist
on up to three call-backs. The achieved sample was therefore taken as representative of the
New Zealand population over the age of 15 years.

It was then determined if each respondent could have been contacted had the telephone
directory been used as a sampling frame. Each name was checked against the telephone
directory current at the time of survey. If that surname was listed, with the same telephone
number, that respondent was immediately coded as being contactable using this frame. To
ensure that incorrect spellings of names were not the reason why the respondents appeared
not to be listed, both the Wise's Directory and the electoral rolls were referred to. If a similar
name at the same address was found the telephone directory was referred to again.
If the respondent was still not verified as listed, the Universal Business Directory, which lists
telephone numbers in numerical order, was used, to ensure that respondents with telephone
numbers listed under other household members' names could also be included in the group
that could be contacted, if their number was actually listed. This was done since the telephone
directory is only used as a household sampling frame. Hence, if that household was
contacted, respondent selection within household would enable the initial respondent to be
included in the sample.
The Universal Business Directory enables the first four letters of the surname of the
telephone subscriber to be determined by looking up the telephone number, as provided by
the respondent. The telephone directory was then used to determine if that person lived at the
same address and had the same telephone number as the respondent. Those that were, were
coded as "listed". They represent that part of the population that could be reached by
sampling from telephone directories. All remaining respondents were coded as being
"unlisted", and represent those who could not have been contacted through the use of the
telephone directory as a sampling frame.
Differences between listed and unlisted respondents were tested using the KolmogorovSmirnov Two Sample Test (Siegel, 1956, pp. 127-136) for ordinal data, or the Chi-Square
Test for nominal data.

Results
A total of 221 respondents out of a sample of 1000 respondents could not have been
contacted if the telephone directory had been used as the sampling frame.
To gain some insight into the bias this may introduce into the sample, a comparison was
made of the demographic characteristics of the "listed" and "unlisted" sample groups. The
findings, summarised in Table 1, indicate that considerable bias is likely to result if telephone
directories are used as sampling frames. In particular, those in unlisted households are more
likely to be:
i.

aged between 15 and 39 years

ii.

never married, or separated or divorced

iii.

young and single, or young and married (with or without children)

iv.

from northern North Island, Auckland, Hamilton or Christchurch.

In contrast, those in unlisted households are less likely to be:

Page 3 of 9

http://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz

Marketing Bulletin, 1992, 3, 38-45, Article 5

i.

aged 55 years or older

ii.

from the south of the North Island, or the South Island

iii.

widowed, or married

iv.

middle aged (whether with or without children)

v.

older (whether married or single)

vi.

from Wellington, northern North Island towns, or South Island towns.

No significant differences between the listed and unlisted groups were found for gender, size
of town or city of residence, socio-economic level, size of household, educational level,
employment status, respondent or household income, or respondent occupation.

Discussion
These results indicate that there can be quite substantial differences between individuals in
listed households and others for some demographic characteristics. Since only 80% of the
population are in listed households, and bias does exist, a survey using telephone directories
as a sampling frame will result in sampling distribution with mean estimates, for items
affected by these characteristics, that do not correspond with the true mean of the population.
Thus the onus is on the researcher to qualify the extent of bias that would be introduced by
using a telephone directory sample.
Although the present research has identified differences in some demographic variables
between 'listed' and 'unlisted' individuals, further studies need to be done to validate these
findings, particularly since there is a limitation in the present study. This study only
compared the demographic characteristics of the listed and unlisted respondents. However, in
some cases, a respondent's demographic characteristics may have little bearing on the topic
under investigation. For this reason, future studies should examine the bias associated with
other variables, such as product usage and purchase probabilities, or other information that
has a direct bearing on the decisions that will be made on the basis of the survey findings.
Such information would aid market researchers in making marketing decisions.
