RIN 3235-AL81
Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: We are proposing revisions to the property disclosure requirements for mining
registrants, and related guidance, currently set forth in Item 102 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and in Industry Guide 7. The
proposed revisions are intended to provide investors with a more comprehensive understanding
of a registrant’s mining properties, which should help them make more informed investment
decisions. The proposed revisions would also modernize the Commission’s disclosure
requirements and policies for mining properties by aligning them with current industry and
global regulatory practices and standards. In addition, we are proposing to rescind Industry
Guide 7 and include the Commission’s mining property disclosure requirements in a new subpart
of Regulation S-K.

INTRODUCTION
The Commission’s disclosure requirements and related guidance for properties owned or

operated by mining companies are contained in Item 102 of Regulation S-K and Industry Guide
7. Item 102 sets forth the basic disclosure requirements for a registrant’s “principal” mines that
are “materially important.” 9 Instruction 3 to Item 102 requires disclosure of “material
information” concerning the “production, reserves, locations, development, and the nature of the
registrant’s interest,” including additional disclosure requirements for individual properties that
“are of major significance to an industry segment.” Instruction 7 to Item 102 states that “the
attention of issuers engaged in significant mining operations is directed to the information called
for in Guide 7,” which identifies disclosures beyond what is required by Item 102.
Guide 7 sets forth the views of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance on how
mining company registrants can comply with the Commission’s description of property
9

Instruction 2 to Item 102 refers registrants to Instruction 1 to Item 101 of Regulation S-K for the
quantitative and qualitative factors they should take into account in determining whether properties should
be described under Item 102.

7

disclosure requirements applicable to registrants. 10 The centerpiece of Guide 7 is its disclosure
guidance for mineral reserves, which are defined as “that part of a mineral deposit that can be
economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.” 11
Guide 7 further classifies mineral reserves into “proven” and “probable,” with proven mineral
reserves having a higher degree of assurance than probable mineral reserves. The Guide does
not define the term “mineral.”
Under both Item 102 and the Guide, a registrant may not disclose estimates for nonreserve deposits, such as mineral resources, 12 unless such information is required to be disclosed
“by foreign or state law” or unless “such estimates previously have been provided to a person (or
any of its affiliates) that is offering to acquire, merge, or consolidate with the registrant, or
otherwise to acquire the registrant's securities.” 13 While there are numerous foreign mining
disclosure codes, only Canada 14 has adopted its code as a matter of law. 15

10

When it published the first Industry Guides in 1968, the Commission stated that, “[t]hese guides are not
rules of the Commission nor are they published as bearing the Commission's official approval. They
represent policies and practices followed by the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance in the
administration of the registration requirements of the Act, but do not purport to furnish complete criteria for
the preparation of registration statements.” Release No. 33-4936 (December 9, 1968) [33 FR 18617]
(December 17, 1968).

11

See paragraph (a)(1) of Guide 7.

12

Resources are generally defined in international mining codes, and generally understood in the industry, as
mineral deposits having prospects for economic extraction that are less certain than those for reserves
because economic viability has yet to be demonstrated. See, e.g, SME Guide for Reporting Exploration
Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (“SME Guide”) pt. 33 (2014), which is available at:
http://www.smenet.org/docs/publications/2014_SME_Guide_Reporting_%20June_10_2014.pdf. See also
section II.E, infra.

13

See Instruction 5 to Item 102 of Regulation S-K. Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(5) of Guide 7 also includes
the same provision limiting disclosure of estimates for deposits other than mineral reserves, as does
Instruction 1 to Item 4.D of Form 20-F.

14

See Canada’s National Instrument (“NI”) 43-101 (“Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects”) (2012),
which is available at: http://web.cim.org/standards/documents/Block484_Doc111.pdf. Other foreign
mining codes have been adopted as listing standards for foreign securities exchanges or as guidelines by

8

Guide 7 has not been updated for more than 30 years. 16 During this period, mining has
become an increasingly globalized industry and several foreign countries have adopted mining
disclosure standards based on the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting
Standards (CRIRSCO) 17 that significantly differ from the Guide. For example, the CRIRSCO
standards 18 require companies to disclose material mineral resources; require that any public
report about a company’s exploration results, 19 mineral resources and mineral reserves be

foreign securities commissions. The staff in the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance has taken
the view that these other codes are not covered by Item 102’s “foreign or state law” exception. Therefore,
in the staff’s view, only the Canadian mining disclosure requirements serve as a basis for disclosure of
mineral resource estimates in SEC filings, and only with respect to Canadian registrants.
15

We are not aware of any state mining disclosure laws that are applicable and have not observed a company
providing mineral resource disclosure based on state law.

16

The disclosure requirements for companies engaged in mining activities were last updated in 1982 when
the Commission amended Form S-18 to add certain disclosure requirements applicable to mining
companies. See Release No. 33-6406 (June 4, 1982) [47 FR 25126] (June 10, 1982). The Commission
later transferred its mining disclosure requirements from Form S-18 to Guide 7. See Release No. 33-6949
(July 30, 1992) [57 FR 36442] (August 13, 1992).

17

CRIRSCO is an international initiative to standardize definitions for mineral resources, mineral reserves,
and related terms for public disclosure. CRIRSCO has representatives from professional societies involved
in developing mineral reporting guidelines in Australasia (Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration
Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC)), Canada (Canadian Institute of Mining Metallurgy
and Petroleum (CIM)), Chile (Minera Comision), Europe (Pan-European Reserves and Resources
Reporting Committee (PERC)), Mongolia (Mongolian Professional Institute of Geosciences and Mining
(MPIGM)), Russia (National Association for Subsoil Examination (NAEN)), South Africa (South African
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (SAMREC)), and the
USA (Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Inc. (SME)). CRIRSCO’s website is located at:
http://www.crirsco.com.

18

The CRIRSCO-based codes, which are best practices of professional associations, have been incorporated
into the listing rules of various foreign stock exchanges. All the codes (together with the listing rules that
make them binding) require disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources, mineral reserves, and other
information about mining properties as long as they are deemed material.

19

Exploration results are defined as data and information generated by mineral exploration programs that
might be of use to investors but which do not form part of a disclosure of mineral resources or mineral
reserves. See, e.g., CRIRSCO’s International Reporting Template pt. 18 (2013), which is available at:
http://www.crirsco.com/templates/international_reporting_template_november_2013.pdf .

9

prepared by a “Competent or Qualified Person;” 20 and permit disclosure of mineral reserves to
be based on a preliminary feasibility (“pre-feasibility”) study or a final feasibility study. 21
Over the years, as part of its filing review and comment process, the staff has provided
supplemental guidance, including requesting clarifications or additional disclosure, to assist
registrants in providing the appropriate disclosure about their mining operations and properties.
For example, in contrast to the practice under the CRIRSCO standards, the staff historically has
requested that a registrant obtain a specific type of feasibility study (i.e., a final feasibility study)
in order to support a determination of mineral reserves.
Because of the widespread adoption of the CRIRSCO standards, industry participants
have requested revisions to Guide 7. 22 Among other matters, 23 these participants have urged the
Commission to align its mining disclosure rules with the CRIRSCO-based codes by allowing a
mining registrant to disclose both mineral resources and reserves. 24 These participants asserted

20

In addition, the CRIRSCO-based codes require that the qualified person must consider and apply certain
factors (“modifying factors”) in his/her evaluation of the economic prospects and economic viability of the
minerals. See the discussion in Sections II.F.1 and II.F.2, infra.

21

A feasibility study is a technical and economic study of a mineral project necessary to demonstrate that
extraction is economically viable. The two kinds of studies commonly used to demonstrate economic
viability, in public disclosure, are preliminary feasibility (also called pre-feasibility) and final feasibility
(also called feasibility) studies. A feasibility study is more comprehensive, and as a result more accurate,
than a pre-feasibility study.

22

See, e.g., the petition for rulemaking by the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Inc. (“SME
Petition for Rulemaking ”) (October 1, 2012), which is available at:
http://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2012/petn4-654.pdf.

23

For example, the SME also specifically expressed concern regarding the limited guidance provided by the
staff on when the disclosure of certain non-reserve deposits known as “mineralized material” would be
appropriate.

24

We also have received letters from members of the United States Congress requesting that the Commission
update and harmonize Guide 7 with global reporting requirements. See the letter, dated July 7, 2014, from
Representatives Shelley Moore Capito, Stevan Pearce, Blaine Luetkemeyer, Sean Duffy, Steve Stivers,
Stephen Fincher, Mick Mulvaney, Randy Hultgren, Ann Wagner, Andy Barr, Tom Cotton, Keith Rothfus,
and William Lacy Clay; and the letter, dated August 13, 2014, from Senators Dean Heller, Mike Crapo and

10

that this would provide investors with a more complete understanding of the economic potential
of a registrant’s properties. 25 Finally, these participants also requested that the Commission
address what they characterize as the uncertainty caused by the fact that Guide 7 and staff
comment letters are not rules of the Commission, but rather non-binding guidance provided by
the Division of Corporation Finance (“Division”). 26
In light of these global developments and industry participants’ concerns, we are
proposing to modernize our disclosure rules for properties owned or operated by mining
companies by more closely aligning those rules with the CRIRSCO-based codes in several
respects. For example, the proposed rules would require a registrant with material mining
operations to disclose, in addition to its mineral reserves, mineral resources that have been
determined based upon information and supporting documentation by one or more qualified
persons. Industry participants assert that such an alignment should help place U.S. mining
registrants on a more level playing field with non-U.S. mining companies that are subject to one
or more of the CRIRSCO-based mining codes. 27 This release requests comment on all aspects of

John Testor. These letters are available at: http://www.sec.gov/comments/disclosureeffectiveness/disclosureeffectiveness.shtml.
25

Unless otherwise stated, in this release the term “property” refers to mining properties, which are properties
at which the registrant engages in mining activities. Mining activities include exploration, development
and production of minerals. The term “mine” refers to a specific geographic location at which the
registrant produces minerals. A property could include multiple mines.

26

See SME Petition for Rulemaking at 9.

27

In this regard, the SME has questioned the attractiveness of the U.S. capital markets for mining companies
in light of the differences between Guide 7 and the CRIRSCO-based codes: “All of these factors decrease
the attractiveness of the U.S. market to current and potential reporting companies. In light of increased
globalization, companies have more choices as to which capital markets to access. Although the U.S. still
presents one of the largest markets and thus will attract companies on that basis alone, there is a marked
reluctance, particularly among exploration-stage mining companies, to pursue initial listings in the U.S.
This harms our stock exchanges, as well as our financial markets.” SME Petition for Rulemaking at 14.

11

our proposed rules, and we encourage all interested parties, including investors, companies, and
other market participants, to submit comments. 28
II.

PROPOSED MINING DISCLOSURE RULES
A.

Consolidation of the Mining Disclosure Requirements

As noted above, the Commission’s current mining disclosure regime involves
overlapping disclosure requirements and policies in different locations (Regulation S-K and
Guide 7), with an instruction (Instruction 7 to Item 102) that registrants engaged in significant
mining operations should “direct their attention” to Guide 7. The combination of the
overlapping structure of the disclosure regime for mining registrants and the brevity of Guide 7
(which has led to a significant amount of staff interpretive guidance through the comment
process) may have created some regulatory uncertainty among mining registrants, particularly
new registrants.
To help address this uncertainty, we propose to rescind Guide 7 and create new
Regulation S-K subpart 1300 29 that would govern disclosure for registrants with mining
operations. 30 In addition, we propose to amend Item 102 of Regulation S-K to replace the
instruction that “the attention of issuers engaged in significant mining operations is directed to

28

The Commission also has issued a concept release on Regulation S-K seeking input on updating and
modernizing our business and financial disclosure requirements. See Release No. 33-10064 (April 13,
2016), [81 FR 23916] (April 22, 2016). The concept release requests comment on a range of topics that
also may apply to mining companies, such as disclosure pertaining to risk factors, description of property
and sustainability. We continue to encourage interested parties to submit comments on the concept release.

29

Proposed 17 CFR 229.1301 et seq.

30

Proposed Regulation S-K subpart 1300 would apply to registration statements under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act as well as to annual reports under the Exchange Act.

12

the information called for in Guide 7” with a new instruction requiring all mining registrants to
refer to and, if required, provide the disclosure under new Regulation S-K subpart 1300. 31
Foreign private issuers that use Form 20-F to file their Exchange Act registration
statements and annual reports, or that refer to Form 20-F when filing their Securities Act
registration statements on Forms F-1 and F-4, are generally not subject to Regulation S-K.
Because we believe that the same property disclosure requirements should apply to both
domestic and foreign mining registrants, the proposed rules would amend Form 20-F to instruct
registrants to refer to, and if required, provide the disclosure under subpart 1300 of Regulation SK. 32 This proposed treatment would be consistent with current staff practice whereby foreign
registrants are subject to the same Guide 7 and other disclosures as domestic mining registrants.
Having one source for mining disclosure obligations should facilitate mining registrants’
compliance with their disclosure requirements by eliminating the complexity resulting from the
existing structure of Commission disclosure obligations in Regulation S-K and staff disclosure
guidance in Industry Guide 7. Moreover, consolidating the disclosure requirements from Guide
7 into Regulation S-K would eliminate any uncertainty about their authority. 33
Request for Comment
1.

The Commission’s current mining disclosure regime consists of disclosure requirements
located in Item 102 of Regulation S-K and disclosure policies located in Guide 7. Has
this disclosure regime caused uncertainty for mining registrants? If so, would

31

Registrants that have material non-mining operations would continue to provide non-mining property
disclosures under Item 102 of Regulation S-K.

32

See section II.H., infra.

33

See note 26, supra. We discuss the expected benefits and costs of the proposed rules in section IV, infra.

13

establishing a sole regulatory source for mining disclosure by rescinding Guide 7 and
including the disclosure requirements for mining registrants in a new Regulation S-K
subpart, as proposed, reduce this uncertainty?
2. Should we amend Item 102 of Regulation S-K by eliminating the instruction that refers
mining registrants to the information called for in Guide 7 and instead instruct them to
refer to, and if required, provide the disclosure under new Regulation S-K subpart 1300,
as proposed? Should we instead retain Guide 7 and Item 102 of Regulation S-K as
separate sources for mining disclosures? If so, how should they apply to registrants?
B.

The Standard for Mining-Related Disclosure
1.

Overview

Under Item 102 of Regulation S-K, registrants are required to disclose principal mines,
other materially important physical properties, and significant mining operations. Guide 7 only
applies to registrants engaged or to be engaged in significant mining operations. When
construed together, Item 102 and Guide 7 suggest that there are two levels of reporting under the
Commission’s current mining disclosure regime. For registrants that have one or more principal
mines or other materially important properties but lack significant mining operations, Item 102
requires less detailed information. For registrants that have significant mining operations, Guide
7 calls for more extensive disclosures. Although both Item 102 and Guide 7 refer to
“significant” mining operations, the staff historically has advised registrants to apply materiality
in determining what disclosures to provide.
Guide 7 does not define “significant” mining operations while Item 102 does not specify
the particular quantitative factors to be considered in determining the materiality of a mine. In

14

the absence of specific guidance, the staff has historically used 10% of a registrant’s total assets
as the benchmark for determining the materiality of a registrant’s mining operations.
We propose that a registrant be required to provide the disclosure under new subpart
1300 of Regulation S-K if its mining operations, as that term is defined in Instruction 1 to
proposed Item 1301(b), 34 are material to its business or financial condition. 35 For purposes of
the new subpart, the term “material” would have the same meaning as under Securities Act Rule
405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. 36
Under proposed new subpart 1300, when determining the materiality of its mining
operations, a registrant would have to:
•

consider both quantitative and qualitative factors, assessed in the context of the
registrant's overall business and financial condition;

34

The term “mining operations” would include operations on all mining properties that a registrant
owns or in which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a direct or indirect economic interest. It also
would include operations on mining properties that a registrant operates, or it is probable that it will
operate, under a lease or other legal agreement that grants the registrant ownership or similar rights that
authorize it, as principal, to sell or otherwise dispose of the mineral. Finally, “mining operations” would
include operations on mining properties that a registrant has, or it is probable that it will have, an associated
royalty or similar right. See Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1301(b). For purposes of subpart 1300, the
term “probable” would have the same meaning as the U.S. GAAP definition of that term. See ASC Section
450-20-20.

35

See proposed Regulation S-K Item 1301(a). Because we are proposing to consolidate the revised mining
disclosure rules under new Regulation S-K subpart 1300, the proposed rules would eliminate Instruction 3
to Item 102, which requires the disclosure of certain specified material information, including “more
detailed information” about a mining registrant’s individual properties that “are of major significance.”

36

See Id. Pursuant to Securities Act Rule 405 (17 CFR 230.405) and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 (17 CFR
240.12b-2), a matter is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would attach
importance to it in determining whether to buy or sell the securities registered. This definition is consistent
with the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding in TSC Industries v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976), that
a fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that the fact would have been viewed by a reasonable
investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of information made available.

15

•

aggregate mining operations on all of its mining properties, regardless of size or type of
commodity produced, including coal, metalliferous minerals, industrial materials,
geothermal energy, and mineral brines; 37 and

•

include, for each property, as applicable, all related mining operations from exploration
through extraction to the first point of material external sale, including processing,
transportation, and warehousing. 38
Consistent with current staff guidance, we are proposing to define “mining operations” to

include all related activities from exploration through extraction to the first point of material
external sale. 39 We believe that including all activities up to the point of first material external
sale is appropriate because all such activities are necessary to convert the mineral resource to
saleable product, which generates the registrants’ revenues. This definition would, however,
exclude all activities subsequent to the first point of sale. Although such activities may add
value to the saleable mining product, they are not necessary to convert the resource into a
saleable product. For example, an aluminum producer who has material bauxite mining
operations and material external bauxite sales would not include any subsequent refinery
activities (such as processing the bauxite into aluminum) in the scope of its mining property
disclosure. We also note that, because this approach would be consistent with current staff
guidance, it is not expected to significantly alter existing disclosure practices.

37

For a discussion of the treatment of mineral brines and energy under proposed subpart 1300, see section
II.E.1, infra.

38

See proposed Item 1301(b) of Regulation S-K.

39

See proposed Item 1301(b)(3) of Regulation S-K.

16

Proposed new subpart 1300 would instruct that a registrant’s mining operations are
presumed to be material if its mining assets constitute 10% or more of its total assets. 40 We
believe it would be appropriate to presume materiality under the proposed rules when mining
assets are at or above a threshold of 10 percent of total assets because at that level the mining
assets are likely to contribute significantly to the registrant’s business or financial condition. We
further believe that the 10% asset threshold is appropriate because it is consistent with similar
10% thresholds that the Commission has used to determine disclosure requirements under a
variety of forms and rules. 41 Finally, the proposed asset test would provide registrants with an
easily applied quantitative standard to use regarding whether they are subject to the new mining
disclosure requirements.
The proposed new subpart would further instruct that if a registrant’s mining assets fall
below the 10% total assets threshold, it would need to consider if there are other factors,
quantitative or qualitative, which would render its mining operations material. 42 Such factors
could include:
•

mining operations that constitute 10% or more of some other financial measure, such as
the registrant’s total revenues, net income or operating income;

40

See Instruction 2 to proposed Item 1301(b) of Regulation S-K. The 10% test is a “rule of thumb” that the
staff has historically applied in the mining context.

41

See, e.g., Item 2.01 of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308); sections 4-08 and 10-01 of Regulation S-X (17 CFR
210.4-08 and 210.10-01); and Items 101 and 911 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.101 and 229.911); see
also ASC Section 280-10-50-12.

42

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 1301(b) of Regulation S-K. Similarly, because the 10% asset test is a
presumption, a registrant with mining operations that constitute more than 10% of its total assets could
evaluate all the relevant quantitative and qualitative factors and conclude that the mining operations are not
required to be disclosed under the proposed standard.

evidence that disclosure of a similar property or properties has had a significant impact
on the price of a registrant’s securities;

•

public disclosure by the registrant discussing the importance to its operations (e.g., from
an operational or competitive standpoint) of a particular property or properties;

•

the unique or rare nature of the particular mineral or the importance of the mineral to the
registrant’s operations;

•

the actual and projected expenditures on the registrant’s mining properties as compared to
its expenditures on non-mining business activities; and

•

the amount of capital raised or planned to be raised by the registrant for its mining
properties. 43
The proposed standard is generally consistent with the existing disclosure requirements

that registrants routinely apply throughout their required filings. It is also consistent with
existing staff guidance relating to the disclosure requirements for companies with mining
operations. Moreover, as discussed below, we are proposing rules and instructions to help
registrants apply the proposed standard under a variety of circumstances, including situations
that are not expressly addressed by the current mining disclosure rules. 44 We believe the
proposed requirements could enhance disclosure to investors.

43

Many of these factors are similar to factors enunciated in Canada’s Companion Policy 43-101CP to
National Instrument 43-101, General Guidance, paragraph 5, which is available at:
http://web.cim.org/standards/documents/Block484_Doc111.pdf. See also the Australian Stock Exchange
(ASX) Listing Rules, Guidance Note 31, pt. 2.2, which is available at:
http://www.asx.com.au/documents/rules/gn31_reporting_on_mining_activities.pdf.

44

See section II.B.1.i-iii, infra.

Finally, because the proposed standard is generally consistent with the disclosure
standard under the CRIRSCO-based mining codes, it should not alter the disclosure practices of
the numerous mining companies that are listed and operate in multiple jurisdictions.
Request for Comment
3.

Should the disclosure standard under the revised mining disclosure rules be whether a
registrant’s mining operations are material to its business or financial condition, as
proposed? Why or why not? If not, what standard should we adopt for determining
whether a registrant must provide the mining disclosure under the revised rules? Why?

4.

Are the quantitative and qualitative factors described in this section relevant to the
determination of the materiality of a registrant’s mining operations? Why or why not?
Are there other factors, such as those identified in Canada’s Companion Policy 43101CP to National Instrument 43-101, General Guidance, that a registrant should
consider for the materiality determination instead of or in addition to the factors
described in this section? Should we include these or other factors as part of the rule
provision governing the materiality determination? If so, which factors should we
include in the rule?

5. Should we adopt the proposed presumption that a registrant’s mining operations are
material if they consist of 10% or more of its total assets? Would a percentage higher or
lower than 10% be better than the proposed threshold? Why or why not? Should it be a
presumption, as proposed, or should it be a bright line requirement? If the former, how
might the presumption be rebutted? Is there another quantitative factor, such as
revenues, that a registrant should consider instead of or in addition to the proposed asset
test?
19

6.

When assessing the materiality of its mining operations, should we require a registrant
to aggregate all of its mining properties, regardless of size or type of commodity
produced, including coal, metalliferous minerals, industrial materials, geothermal
energy, and mineral brines, 45 as proposed? Why or why not? Should we exclude any
of the specified commodities from the proposed aggregation requirement? If so, which
commodities and why?

7.

When assessing the materiality of its mining operations, should we require a registrant
to include, for each property, as applicable, all related activities from exploration
through extraction to the first point of material external sale, including processing,
transportation, and warehousing, as proposed? Why or why not? Is “the first point of
material external sale” the appropriate cut-off or should we use some other measure?
Are there certain activities that we should exclude from the materiality determination,
even if they occur before the first point of material external sale? If so, which activities,
for which minerals or companies, and why? Are there certain activities after the point
of first material external sale that we should include? If so, which activities, for which
minerals or companies, and why?

8.

Are there specific qualitative or quantitative factors relating to the environmental or
social impacts of a registrant’s properties or operations that a registrant should consider
in making its materiality determination?

45

As discussed in section II.E.1, we are proposing that the commodities covered by the definition of mineral
resource include mineralization, including dumps and tailings, geothermal fields, mineral brines, and other
resources extracted on or within the earth’s crust. See proposed Item 1301(d)(14)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

i.

Treatment of vertically-integrated companies

Some companies have material mining operations that are secondary to or in support of
their main non-mining business. For example, a metal manufacturer may operate iron ore or coal
mines to supply raw material for its primary business. Neither Guide 7 nor Item 102 addresses
whether or when a vertically-integrated manufacturer 46 is required to provide mining disclosure.
Proposed new subpart 1300 would apply to all registrants with mining operations,
including vertically-integrated manufacturers. Specifically, a mining operation owned by a
registrant to support its primary business could be material and require disclosure. The fact that
the registrant’s primary business operation is something other than minerals extraction would not
be determinative of whether disclosure would be required under the proposed subpart.
For example, the bauxite mining operations of an aluminum manufacturer, whose
primary business is manufacturing, not mining, could be material and require disclosure if its
bauxite operations represent ten percent or more of the registrant’s assets, even though they are
not the registrant’s primary operations, or the primary source of the registrant’s revenues. In
addition, even if the bauxite or other mining operations of such a vertically-integrated
manufacturer constitute less than ten percent of its total assets, its mining operations could still
be material and trigger disclosure obligations if, for example, the manufacturer derives a
competitive advantage from, or substantially relies upon, its ability to source that particular
mineral from its mining operations.
Requiring disclosure of mining operations in such circumstances would be consistent
with the disclosure currently provided in SEC filings and should not significantly alter existing
46

A vertically-integrated manufacturer is a company that owns part of its supply chain. In this context, it
refers to a registrant that has mining operations to supply raw material to its manufacturing business.

21

disclosure practices. In addition, subjecting vertically-integrated companies to the proposed
rules would align the disclosure requirements for such companies with those of companies
primarily engaged in mining activities. Also, we note that most of the foreign jurisdictions that
have CRIRSCO-based rules require disclosure for material mining properties and provide no
exemptions for vertically-integrated companies. 47

Should we require vertically-integrated companies, such as manufacturers, to provide
the disclosure required under new Regulation S-K subpart 1300, as proposed? Why or
why not?
ii.

Treatment of multiple property ownership

As discussed above, the primary focus of the current rules and guidance is on
individually significant or material properties. It is, however, very common for registrants to
own multiple mining properties. In some instances, the registrant will have multiple properties
that all involve exploration, development or extraction of the same mineral. In other situations,
the registrant’s operations will primarily involve exploration, development or extraction of one
mineral from several properties, but the registrant also will own one or more ancillary properties
where it explores, develops or extracts small amounts (relative to the predominant mineral) of a
different mineral. Neither Item 102 nor Guide 7 provides guidance concerning when or what

47

For example, ASX Listing Rules require disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral
reserves for all “material mineral projects.” In defining a “material mineral project,” the ASX Listing
Rules, Guidance Note 31, pt. 2.2, provides that “[i]n many cases, it will be readily apparent that a particular
mining activity is a material mining project for the purposes of the Listing Rules and therefore the
disclosure requirements in Listing Rules 5.7 - 5.19 will apply to any disclosures of exploration results,
estimates of mineral resources or ore reserves, historical estimates or foreign estimates of mineralisation, or
production targets for that project. Judgment however may need to be exercised where an entity has
multiple mining projects or where it has a mix of mining projects and other business activities.”

22

disclosure is required in these situations. To address this, the staff has provided interpretive
guidance about what, if any, disclosure is required by multiple or ancillary property owners.
Under the proposed rules, a registrant with multiple properties would be required to
consider all of its mining properties individually and in the aggregate, regardless of size or
commodity produced, when assessing whether it must provide the mining disclosure required by
new subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. 48 A registrant with multiple properties, none of which is
individually material, but which in the aggregate constitute material mining operations, would
have to provide summary disclosure 49 concerning its combined mining activities rather than
providing disclosure for individual properties. 50
Under the proposed rules, a registrant could be required to provide disclosure for a
particular property, depending on the facts and circumstances, even if ancillary to the
registrant’s predominant commodity. For example, a property on which a registrant explores,
develops or extracts a relatively small amount of a particular mineral, compared to its
predominant mineral, could be material based upon the amount of actual and projected
expenditures on the property as compared to its expenditures on other properties.

48

See proposed Item 1301(b)(2) of Regulation S-K.

49

See section II.G.1, infra for a more detailed discussion of the summary disclosure requirements, which
would include summary information about a registrant’s 20 largest properties, by asset value. In the case
of a registrant with material mining operations in the aggregate, but with no individual properties that are
material, we believe that investors would benefit more from the proposed summary disclosure concerning
the registrant’s properties in the aggregate than from detailed disclosure concerning each individual
property, some or all of which may not have mineral resources, mineral reserves or exploration results.

50

To the extent that an individual property is material to a registrant’s operations, the proposed rules would
also require detailed disclosure about that property. See section II.G.2, infra, for a discussion of those
disclosure requirements.

23

We believe the proposed rules would provide a clear and consistent standard for
registrants to apply in determining the scope of their disclosure obligations, while helping to
ensure that investors receive relevant information about the operations and risks associated with
registrants’ mining operations.

determining if disclosure is required under the proposed rules? If so, how should our

iii.

Treatment of royalty companies and other companies holding
economic interests in mining properties

Some registrants are royalty companies, which are companies that do not own or operate
a property, but rather own the right to receive payments, called a royalty right, from the owner or
operator of a property. 51 In addition, some registrants hold other economic interests, similar to

51

A royalty, in this context, is typically a payment to the royalty right holder from the property owner or
operator in return for: (i) providing upfront capital; (ii) paying part of amount due land owners or mineral
right holders; or (iii) converting a participating interest in a joint venture into a royalty right. Such payment

24

royalty rights, also without owning or operating a property. 52 Neither Item 102 nor Guide 7
address whether royalty or similar companies must provide disclosure about the mining
operations and properties underlying their economic interest. Consequently, the staff has
provided guidance about whether and how such companies should provide mining disclosure.
Under the proposed rules, consistent with prior staff guidance, a royalty company or
other registrant that holds a similar economic interest would have to provide all applicable
mining disclosure if the mining operations that generate the royalty or other payment (the
underlying mining operations) are material to the royalty or similar company’s operations as a
whole. Similar to a producing mining company (that owns or operates properties), a royalty or
similar company would have to assess both quantitative and qualitative factors to determine
whether the underlying mining operations are material. 53
Investors in royalty and other similar companies need information about the material
mining properties that generate the payments to the registrant, including mineral reserves and
production, to be able to assess the amounts, soundness and sustainability of future payments.
For the royalty or similar company and its investors, the mining property underlying the royalty
or similar payments is the primary or only source of revenues and cash flow. As such, we
believe royalty companies and other companies holding similar economic interests should
provide the same type and amount of disclosure as registrants with mining operations.

is most often based on a percentage of the minerals, revenues, or profits generated from the property.
52

Examples include the right to purchase all or a portion of minerals from a mine under a metal purchase
agreement (a “stream” agreement) or a working interest in the underlying property.

53

In this regard, because a registrant with royalty or other similar economic interests does not own or operate
the producing property, revenues are often a more relevant benchmark than assets for determining
materiality.

25

The proposed rules would require a royalty or similar company to provide disclosure only
for those underlying properties, or portions of underlying properties, that generate the registrant’s
royalties or similar payments, and only for the reserves and production that generated its
payments in the reporting period. 54 We do not believe that investors in a company holding
royalty or similar rights need information relating to portions of the mining property that do not
contribute to the registrant’s royalty stream, as such portions do not impact the results of
operations or overall value of the registrant. This proposed limitation on the scope of the
disclosure required for royalty or other similar companies also recognizes the limitations of the
company’s rights. Specifically, the registrant may not have access to information about portions
of the mining property that do not contribute to the registrant’s revenue stream. 55
A royalty or similar company would need to describe the material properties that generate
its royalties or similar payments and file a technical report summary for each such property. 56
Such a registrant would not, however, have to submit a separate technical report summary about
a property that is covered by a current technical report summary filed by the producing mining
registrant. In that situation, the royalty or similar company may incorporate by reference the
producing registrant’s previously filed technical report summary. 57

54

See Instruction 2 to proposed Item 1303(b)(2) of Regulation S-K and Instruction 4 to proposed Item
1304(b)(5) through (7) of Regulation S-K.

55

This is consistent with the Commission’s current rules providing that information required need be given
only insofar as it is known or reasonably available to the registrant. See Securities Act Rule 409 (17 CFR
230.409) and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21 (17 CFR 240.12b-21).

56

As discussed, in section II.C.1 infra, the proposed rules would require registrants to file technical report
summaries, as exhibits, to support disclosure of mineral resources, mineral reserves, and material
exploration results.

to gain access to such information) in which a royalty or similar company should not be
required to file a technical report summary concerning the underlying property?

Definitions of exploration, development and production stage

Guide 7 defines the stages used to describe mining operations, “exploration stage,”
“development stage,” and “production stage,” as follows:
•

Exploration Stage — includes all registrants engaged in the search for mineral deposits
(reserves) which are not in either the development or production stage.

•

Development Stage — includes all registrants engaged in the preparation of a determined
commercially minable deposit (reserves) for its extraction which are not in the production
stage.

•

Production Stage — includes all registrants engaged in the exploitation of a mineral
deposit (reserve). 58
Guide 7 applies these definitions to the registrant as a whole, however, and not on a

property-by-property basis. As such, Guide 7 does not provide guidance as to when and how the
definitions of exploration, development and production stage apply to registrants that own
properties in different stages. To address this ambiguity and to help ensure that investors receive
disclosure that accurately reflects a registrant’s operational status, we are proposing to revise the
Guide 7 definitions of exploration, development and production stage so that the definitions
apply to individual properties, as follows:
•

an exploration stage property is a property that has no mineral reserves disclosed; 59

•

a development stage property is a property that has mineral reserves disclosed, but with
no material extraction; 60 and

58

Guide 7 paragraph (a)(4).

59

See proposed Item 1301(d)(6) of Regulation S-K.

28

•

a production stage property is a property with material extraction of mineral reserves. 61
We also are proposing to revise the Guide 7 definitions as they apply to issuers in order

to recognize that issuers may have properties in differing stages, as follows:
•

an exploration stage issuer is one that has no material property with mineral reserves; 62

•

a development stage issuer is one that is engaged in the preparation of mineral reserves for
extraction on at least one material property; 63 and

•

a production stage issuer is one that is engaged in material extraction of mineral reserves
on at least one material property. 64
Finally, we propose to specify that a registrant that does not have reserves on any of its

properties, even if it has mineral resources or exploration results, or even if it is engaged in
extraction without first disclosing mineral reserves, 65 cannot characterize itself as a development
or production stage company. 66 The proposed rules would also require a company to identify an
individual property with no mineral reserves as an exploration stage property, even if it has other
properties in development or production. 67

60

See proposed Item 1301(d)(3) of Regulation S-K.

64

See proposed Item 1301(d)(19) of Regulation S-K.

65

There are registrants that start development or production without first disclosing mineral reserves. Such
practices increase the business’ risks due to the absence of the detailed technical and economic analysis
required to disclose reserves, thus increasing the degree of uncertainty surrounding the quantities and
quality of the mineral to be extracted.

66

See the Instruction to proposed Item 1304(b)(3) of Regulation S-K.

29

We believe that these proposed changes would resolve the ambiguities in the Guide 7
definitions. They also would be consistent with prior staff guidance, which should minimize
changes in disclosure practices for registrants and their investors. Under the proposed
definitions, a registrant would be able to characterize its properties separately, but would be
limited in when and how it can characterize its operational stage. Specifically, it would not be
able to characterize itself as a development stage registrant unless it is engaged in the preparation
of mineral reserves for extraction on at least one material property. We believe this would
benefit investors by providing them with clearer, more accurate and consistent disclosure about
the type of company and level of risk involved. In particular, prohibiting a registrant without any
mineral reserves from characterizing itself as a production or development stage company would
help eliminate the possibility that such a registrant, by definition a higher risk company, would
incorrectly characterize itself as being in a lower risk stage, thereby potentially misleading or
confusing investors.
Further, providing definitions that apply to specific properties would align the disclosure
requirements with current accounting practices under U.S. GAAP and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB). 68 Conforming the definitions in the proposed requirements to the applicable accounting
practice should benefit both registrants and investors by providing a consistent framework for the

68

Although there is no authoritative guidance under U.S. GAAP that directly addresses accounting for mining
activities, the accounting practice has typically been based on the definition of an asset in Statement of
Financial Accounting Concepts Elements of Financial Statements (“Concept Statement 6”), with a focus on
the operational stage of individual properties rather than on the stage of the registrant. Similarly,
accounting for costs under IFRS also focuses on individual properties.

16. Should we define “exploration stage property,” “development stage property” and
“production stage property,” as proposed? Why or why not? Would these definitions
facilitate compliance by registrants with properties in more than one stage of operation?
17. Should we also revise the definitions of “exploration stage issuer,” “development stage
issuer” and “production stage issuer,” as proposed? Why or why not? Should the
definition of “development stage issuer” and “production stage issuer” depend on
having “at least one material property”, as proposed? Should we instead base the
definitions on consideration of the characteristics of all mining properties? For
example, if a registrant has a single development-stage material property that constitutes
10% of its mining assets, with the remainder of the mining assets all constituting
exploration stage properties, should the registrant be able to identify itself as a
development stage issuer?
18. Would the two proposed sets of definitions appropriately classify the particular stage of
a registrant’s mining operations? Should the definitions be property-based and
dependent on whether mineral resources or reserves have been disclosed, are being
prepared for extraction, or are being extracted, as applicable, on one or more material
properties? Would having two proposed sets of definitions create unnecessary
complexity or investor confusion?

Should the proposed rules specify that a registrant that does not have mineral reserves
on any of its properties, even if it has mineral resources or exploration results, or even if

it is engaged in extraction without first disclosing mineral reserves, cannot characterize
itself as a development or production stage company, as proposed? Why or why not?
C.

Qualified Person and Responsibility for Disclosure
1.

The “qualified person” requirement

All of the CRIRSCO-based codes require that any public report about a company’s
exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves be based on and fairly reflect
information and supporting documentation prepared by a “competent” or “qualified person.” 69
“Public report” as used in the CRIRSCO-based codes includes all communication by a company
to investors on exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves. 70 The purpose of this
requirement is to ensure that a registrant’s public declaration of exploration results, mineral
resources and reserves is supported by the findings of a mineral industry professional having the
relevant level of expertise. 71 In contrast, neither Guide 7 nor Item 102 requires that a registrant’s
disclosure of mineral reserves be based on the findings of an appropriately experienced
professional. 72 While an author of a study or technical report that forms the basis of mineral

69

See, e.g., CRIRSCO’s International Reporting Template pt. 8; Canada’s NI 43-101 pt. 2.1; and JORC Code
pt. 9.

70

For example, Australia’s JORC Code defines public report as: “…reports prepared for the purpose of
informing investors or potential investors and their advisers on Exploration Results, Mineral Resources or
Ore Reserves. They include, but are not limited to, annual and quarterly company reports, press releases,
information memoranda, technical papers, website postings and public presentations.” JORC Code pt. 6
(2012). The JORC Code is available at: http://www.jorc.org/docs/JORC_code_2012.pdf.

71

The CRIRSCO-based standards are built on three governing principles: transparency, materiality and
competence. All these codes define competence to mean that technical work should be done by a
professional with requisite expertise. See, e.g., CRIRSCO’s International Reporting Template pt. 3, which
states: “Competence requires that the Public Report be based on work that is the responsibility of suitably
qualified and experienced persons who are subject to an enforceable professional code of ethics and rules
of conduct.” See also JORC Code pt. 9 and SME Guide pt. 3.

72

Guide 7 only calls for disclosure of the name of the person estimating the reserves and the nature of his or
her relationship to the registrant. See Guide 7 paragraph (b)(5)(ii). In addition, if a registrant

32

reserves disclosure in a Securities Act registration statement must consent to the use of its name
as an expert, 73 there is no requirement to use an expert for reserves disclosure and, if one is used,
there are no substantive requirements for that expertise.
We are proposing that every disclosure of mineral resources, mineral reserves and
material exploration results reported in a registrant’s filed registration statements and reports
must be based on, and accurately reflect information and supporting documentation prepared by,
a “qualified person,” 74 as defined by the proposed rules. 75 In addition, the proposed rules would
require that the registrant:
•

be responsible for determining that the person meets the qualifications specified under the
new subpart’s definition of “qualified person” and that the disclosure in the filing
accurately reflects the information provided by the qualified person; 76

•

obtain a dated and signed technical report summary from the qualified person, which
identifies and summarizes for each material property the information reviewed and
conclusions reached by the qualified person about the registrant’s exploration results,
mineral resources or mineral reserves; 77

supplementally provides a copy of a technical report to Division staff, Guide 7 specifies that the copy
include the name of its author and the date of its preparation, if known to the registrant. See Guide 7
paragraph (c)(2).

See proposed Item 1302(a) of Regulation S-K. While we refer to the qualified person in the singular
throughout this release, we note that it is common for a registrant to have more than one qualified person
prepare a technical report for a mining property or project. As proposed, the registrant’s responsibilities
would apply to each qualified person so engaged.

consent as an exhibit to the filing pursuant to Securities Act Rule 436. 83 In such situations, the
qualified person would be subject to liability as an expert for any untrue statement or omission of
a material fact contained in the technical report summary under Section 11 of the Securities
Act. 84
The Securities Act and the Exchange Act each provide that the registration statements
and periodic reports required under those statutes shall contain such information and documents
as the Commission may require, as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the
protection of investors. 85 We believe that the proposed requirement that a registrant’s disclosure
of mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration results in SEC filings be based
on and fairly reflect information and supporting documentation prepared by a “qualified person”
would further the protection of investors for several reasons.

82

See proposed Item 1302(b)(4) of Regulation S-K.

83

See 17 CFR 230.436 and 229.601(b)(23). A registrant would also have to file the written consent as an
exhibit to an Exchange Act registration statement or report when the Exchange Act filing is automatically
incorporated into a previously filed Securities Act registration statement.

84

15 U.S.C. 77k(a)(4).

85

See Securities Act Section 7(a) (15 U.S.C. 77g(a)) and Exchange Act Sections 12(b)(1),)12(g)(1), and 13(a)
(15 U.S.C. 78l(b)(1), 78l(g)(1), and 78m(a)).

35

First, this requirement could make the determination and reporting of material
exploration results or estimates of mineral resources and reserves more reliable. 86 This is
particularly important since we are proposing to require, for the first time, that a registrant with
material mining operations disclose mineral resources and material exploration results in SEC
filings. Second, we believe that the proposed requirement that a registrant file a copy of the
technical report summary for each material property as an exhibit to the SEC filing would
enhance investor understanding of a registrant’s material properties. Specifically, it would
provide investors with a summary of the scientific and technical information that is the basis for
the registrant’s disclosure of mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration results,
which should enable investors to assess better the value of the registrant’s material properties.
Third, the proposed qualified person requirement would help to mitigate any risks associated
with our proposal to require disclosure of mineral resources or material exploration results,
which reflect a lower level of certainty about the economic value of mining properties than is
reflected in the disclosure of mineral reserves. 87 Finally, the proposed qualified person
requirement would strengthen the Commission’s disclosure requirements in a manner consistent
with most foreign mining jurisdictions, thus benefiting investors and promoting uniformity.

86

To the extent that a registrant’s determination of mineral resources, mineral reserves and material
exploration results is currently based on information and supporting documentation prepared by persons
who would be “qualified persons” under the proposed rules, the potential benefits of this requirement could
be less. In addition, our proposal presumes that the standards that we have set forth for determining who is
a “qualified person,” which are consistent with CRIRSCO-based standards, are the appropriate standards.
There may be situations when that presumption excludes a person with significant, relevant experience
because that person has chosen not to be a member of a recognized professional organization. Despite the
professional competency of such person, he or she will not be deemed to be a “qualified person” under the
proposed rules.

87

See sections II.D and E, infra.

36

We propose to require the registrant to file the technical report summary as an exhibit
(rather than in the body of the annual report or registration statement) in order to separate the
underlying scientific and technical information in the technical report summary from the
narrative disclosure concerning the registrant’s operations. 88 We believe this would result in
clearer and more accessible disclosure for investors, enabling them to understand the disclosure
more effectively from both an operational and technical viewpoint.
The proposed requirement to obtain a signed and dated technical report summary would
help establish the authenticity and relevance of the technical report summary. The proposed
requirement to obtain the written consent of the qualified person to use his or her name and any
quotation or other use of the technical report summary would help ensure that such information
is not included in an SEC filing without the qualified person’s actual knowledge. In addition,
requiring the registrant to file the qualified person’s written consent is consistent with the
Commission’s approach to the use of an expert’s report in Securities Act filings 89 and would
align the Commission’s mining disclosure rules with the CRIRSCO-based codes, which impose
a similar written consent requirement. 90
The proposed requirement that a registrant identify the qualified person that prepared the
technical report summary and, if the qualified person is not an employee of the registrant,
88

The staff currently has the ability to request a copy of a technical report as supplemental material, where it
is deemed appropriate, during the course of its review of a registration statement or report. See Securities
Act Rule 418 (17 CFR 230.418) and Exchange Act Rule 12b-4 (17 CPR 240.12b-4). Securities Act Rule
418(a)(6) specifically authorizes the staff, "where reserve estimates are referred to in a document," to
request "a copy of the full report of the engineer or other expert who estimated the reserves." 17 CFR
230.418(a)(6).

89

See, e.g., Securities Act Rule 436.

90

See, e.g., Canada’s NI 43-101 pt. 8.3; the JORC Code pt. 9; South Africa’s SAMREC Code pt. 8 (2009),
which is available at: http://www.samcode.co.za/downloads/SAMREC2009.pdf; and the SME Guide pt. 8.

37

disclose whether the qualified person or the qualified person’s employer is an affiliate would
provide investors with relevant information to assess the reliability of the disclosure and align the
Commission’s mining rules with most of the CRIRSCO-based codes, which impose a similar
identification requirement. 91
We are not proposing that a qualified person must be independent from the registrant for
several reasons. First, we believe that our approach would help to limit the compliance burdens
on registrants. Second, we believe that other aspects of the recommended proposals, such as
disclosure of the qualified person’s credentials and his or her affiliated status with the registrant
or another entity having an ownership or similar interest in the subject property, along with the
application of potential expert liability in Securities Act filings, should provide adequate
safeguards for investors. Finally, as discussed above, our approach is consistent with most of the
CRIRSCO-based codes, 92 which permit a qualified person to be an employee or other affiliate of
the registrant as long as the registrant discloses its relationship with the qualified person.
Request for Comment
20. Should we require, as proposed, that the determination of mineral resources, mineral
reserves and material exploration results, as reported in a registrant’s filed registration
statements and reports, be based on and accurately reflect information and supporting

91

See, e.g., the JORC Code pt. 9; EU’s PERC Reporting Standard pt. 9 (2013), which is available at:
http://www.vmine.net/PERC/documents/PERC_REPORTING_STANDARD_2013_rev2.pdf. A limited
exception to this is Canada, which requires a registrant to file a technical report summary prepared by an
independent qualified person in certain circumstances: when becoming a first-time registrant; when
supporting the first time reporting of mineral resources, mineral reserves, or a preliminary economic
assessment of a material property; or when reporting a 100% or greater change in the total mineral
resources or reserves on a material property, when compared to the last disclosure. See NI 43-101 pt. 5.3.

documentation prepared by a qualified person? Why or why not? Would imposing a
qualified person requirement help mitigate the risks associated with including disclosure
about a registrant’s mineral resources and exploration results in SEC filings, given that
mineral resources and exploration results reflect a lower level of certainty about the
economic value of mining properties? Why or why not?
21. Should the registrant be responsible for determining that the qualified person meets the
qualifications specified under the new subpart’s definition of “qualified person” as
proposed? Why or why not? If not the registrant, who should be responsible for this
determination?
22. Should we, as proposed, require a registrant to obtain a technical report summary from
the qualified person, which identifies and summarizes the information reviewed and
conclusions reached by the qualified person about the registrant’s exploration results,
mineral resources or mineral reserves, before it can disclose those results, resources or
reserves in SEC filings? Why or why not? Should we instead require a registrant to
obtain an unabridged technical report, rather than a technical report summary, before it
can disclose exploration results, mineral resources or mineral reserves in SEC filings?
Should we require the technical report summary to be dated and signed, as proposed?
Why or why not?
23. If we require, as proposed, that a registrant obtain a technical report summary from the
qualified person, should we also, as proposed, require that the registrant file the
technical report summary as an exhibit to the relevant registrant statement or other
Commission filing when one is required? Why or why not?

39

24. Should we require, as proposed, a registrant to file the technical report summary when
the registrant is disclosing mineral reserves, mineral resources or material exploration
results for the first time or when there is a material change in the mineral reserves,
mineral resources or exploration results from the last technical report filed for the
property? Why or why not? Should we instead require a registrant to file the technical
report summary more frequently, such as with every Commission filing, or less
frequently?
25. Should we require, as proposed, a registrant to obtain the written consent of the
qualified person to the use of the qualified person’s name and any quotation or other use
of the technical report summary in the registration statement or report prior to filing the
document publicly with the Commission? Why or why not?
26. Should we require that a registrant identify the qualified person that prepared the
technical report summary and disclose whether the qualified person is an employee, as
proposed? Why or why not? Should we also require a registrant to name the qualified
person’s employer if other than the registrant, and disclose whether the qualified person
or the qualified person’s employer is an affiliate of the registrant or another issuer that
has an ownership, royalty or other interest in the property that is the subject of the
technical report summary, as proposed? Why or why not?
27. Should we require a registrant to state whether the qualified person is independent of
the registrant? Why or why not? If we were to require the registrant to state whether
the qualified person is independent of the registrant, should we define “independent” for
purposes of that requirement? If so, how? For example, should we base the definition

40

of independence on comparable provisions under Canada’s NI 43-101? 93 Similar to the
Canadian provisions, should we provide examples of when a qualified person would not
be considered to be independent? If so, what examples should we provide?
Alternatively, similar to the Commission’s rule regarding when an accountant is not
independent, 94 should we provide that a qualified person is not independent if the
qualified person is not capable of, or a reasonable investor with knowledge of all
relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that the qualified person is not capable
of, exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the
qualified person’s engagement? Are there any other alternative standards on which we
should base a definition of independence for the purpose of the qualified person
requirement?
28. Should we require that a registrant’s disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources
or mineral reserves in a SEC filing be based on the determination of a qualified person
that is independent of the registrant? If so, should we impose such a requirement only
under certain circumstances, such as when the filing discloses resources or reserves by
93

Pt. 1.5 of Canada’s NI 43-101 provides that a “qualified person is independent of an issuer if
there is no circumstance that, in the opinion of a reasonable person aware of all relevant facts, could
interfere with the qualified person’s judgment regarding the preparation of the technical report.” Pt. 1.4 of
NI 43-101 (CP) then provides guidance regarding when a qualified person would not be considered to be
independent: “We consider a qualified person is not independent when the qualified person (a) is an
employee, insider, or director of the issuer; (b) is an employee, insider, or director of a related party of the
issuer; (c) is a partner of any person or company in paragraph (a) or (b); (d) holds or expects to hold
securities, either directly or indirectly, of the issuer or a related party of the issuer; (e) holds or expects to
hold securities, either directly or indirectly, in another issuer that has a direct or indirect interest in the
property that is the subject of the technical report or in an adjacent property; (f) is an employee, insider, or
director of another issuer that has a direct or indirect interest in the property that is the subject of the
technical report or in an adjacent property; (g) has or expects to have, directly or indirectly, an ownership,
royalty, or other interest in the property that is the subject of the technical report or an adjacent property; or
(h) has received the majority of their income, either directly or indirectly, in the three years preceding the
date of the technical report from the issuer or a related party of the issuer.”

the registrant for the first time; a material change in previously disclosed resources or
reserves that has occurred or is likely to occur; or a 100% or greater change in the total
mineral resources or reserves on a material property, when compared to the last
disclosure? In each case, why or why not?
29.

Alternatively, rather than requiring the qualified person to be independent, should we
require, when the qualified person is affiliated with the registrant or another entity
having an ownership or similar interest in the property, that a person independent of the
registrant and qualified person review the qualified person’s work? If so, what
qualifications should the independent reviewer possess? If we require an independent
review when the qualified person is affiliated with the registrant, should the review be
for all disclosures of mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration
results, or only those that are related to material properties? Should this review be
required only in certain circumstances, such as when the filing discloses resources or
reserves by the registrant for the first time; a material change in previously disclosed
resources or reserves that has occurred or is likely to occur; or a 100% or greater
change in the total mineral resources or reserves on a material property, when
compared to the last disclosure? Should we instead adopt an independent review
requirement for the work of an affiliated qualified person in all circumstances? In each
case, why or why not?

30.

Should we require the registrant to disclose any material conflicts of interest that could
reasonably affect the judgment or decision making of the qualified person, such as
material ongoing business relationships between the registrant and the qualified person
or the qualified person’s employer?
42

31. Would the proposed technical report summary filing requirement impose a significant
burden on registrants? If so, which registrants and why? Are there changes that we
could make to this proposed requirement to alleviate any such burden?
2.

The definition of “qualified person”

We are proposing to define a “qualified person” as a person who is a mineral industry
professional with at least five years of relevant experience in the type of mineralization and type
of deposit under consideration and in the specific type of activity that person is undertaking on
behalf of the registrant. In addition, in order to be a qualified person, a person must be an
eligible member or licensee in good standing of a recognized professional organization at the
time the technical report is prepared. 95
For an organization to be a “recognized professional organization,” it must be either
recognized within the mining industry as a reputable professional association, 96 or be a board
authorized by U.S. federal, state or foreign statute to regulate professionals in the mining,
geoscience or related field. Furthermore, the organization must:
•

admit eligible members primarily on the basis of their academic qualifications and
experience;

•

establish and require compliance with professional standards of competence and ethics;

•

require or encourage continuing professional development;

95

See proposed Item 1301(d)(22) of Regulation S-K.

96

This standard is also used in Canada’s NI 43-101, although that instrument does not provide factors to
assess when determining which organizations are reputable. See the definition of “professional
association” in NI 43-101 pt. 1.1.

43

•

have and apply disciplinary powers, including the power to suspend or expel a member
regardless of where the member practices or resides; and

•

provide a public list of members in good standing. 97
This proposed definition is similar to the definition of competent or qualified person

under the CRIRSCO-based codes. 98 It differs, however, from those codes in at least one respect.
Although CRIRSCO provides some guidance about what constitutes a “recognized professional
organization,” 99 most of the CRIRSCO-based codes require that a competent or qualified person
be a member of one or more “approved” organizations identified in an appendix to the code. 100
This list is updated periodically by the various code regulators.
In contrast, our proposed definition is more flexible while still providing assurance that
the qualified person has the appropriate level of professional expertise to support disclosure of
exploration results, mineral resources, or mineral reserves. Although this flexible approach
would require registrants to exercise some judgment as to the qualified person’s credentials, we
believe it is a better option than requiring the person to be a member of one of several
specifically identified organizations, as is the case under most of the CRIRSCO-based codes.
97

See proposed Item 1301(d)(22) of Regulation S-K.

98

The CRIRSCO standards require that a competent or qualified person have at least five years of relevant
experience “in the style of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration and in the activity which
that person is undertaking” and be a member or licensee in good standing of a recognized professional
organization. See CRIRSCO’s International Reporting Template pt. 11; see also the JORC Code
pt. 11; the SAMREC Code pt. 10; the SME Guide pt. 9; and the PERC Reporting Standard pt. 10. The
recognized professional organizations under CRIRSCO standards have and apply disciplinary powers to
member classes eligible to serve as qualified persons and most require professional development to
maintain such membership.

99

See CRIRSCO’s International Reporting Template pt. 11.

100

See, e.g., the JORC Code pt. 11; the SAMREC Code pt. 9; the SME Guide pt. 9; and the PERC Reporting
Standard pt. 10.

44

Although the “approved organization” approach may be initially easier to apply, it could also
become outdated as circumstances change. This could adversely impact the quality of
disclosure. In contrast, our principles-based approach would provide flexibility to allow for ease
of compliance and protection of investors.
As discussed above, an organization that is recognized “within the mining industry as a
reputable professional association,” can be, if all the other conditions are satisfied, a “recognized
professional organization.” We are not, however, proposing any specific factors that would
indicate that a professional association is reputable. We are instead seeking comment on what
factors we should consider, and whether such factors should be incorporated into the final rules.
Examples could include the frequency and quality of an association’s peer-reviewed
publications, the number and global distribution of its members, and whether and to what extent
the association publishes guides or standards that are accepted and used in the industry.
Regarding the minimum experience requirement, we believe five years would be an
appropriate time frame to use for purposes of the definition of a qualified person. It ensures a
prolonged period of professional experience without unduly restricting the pool of qualified
experts. Furthermore, it is an accepted industry standard found in the corresponding definitions
under the CRIRSCO-based codes. 101
To assist registrants in applying the “qualified person” definition, we are also proposing
detailed instructions to the definition of “qualified person.” 102 The instructions describe the
specific types and amount of experience necessary for various types of mining activities and

101

See, e.g., NI 43-101 pt. 1.1, JORC pt. 11, CRIRSCO Template pt. 11, and SAMREC pt. 10.

102

See the proposed instructions to paragraph (d)(22) of Item 1301.

45

mineral deposits. For example, if the qualified person is preparing or supervising the preparation
of a technical report concerning exploration results, the relevant experience must be in
exploration. If the qualified person is estimating, or supervising the estimation of, mineral
resources, the relevant experience must be in the estimation, assessment and evaluation of
mineral resources and associated modifying factors. 103 Similarly, if the qualified person is
estimating, or supervising the estimation of, mineral reserves, the relevant experience must be in
engineering and other disciplines required for the estimation, assessment, evaluation and
economic extraction of mineral reserves. 104
Pursuant to the proposed instructions, a qualified person must also have relevant
experience in evaluating the specific type of mineral deposit under consideration (e.g., coal,
metal, base metal, industrial mineral, mineral brine, or geothermal fields). What constitutes
relevant experience in this regard is a facts and circumstances determination. For example,
experience in a high-nugget, vein-type mineralization such as tin or tungsten would likely be
relevant experience for estimating mineral resources for vein-gold mineralization whereas
experience in a low grade disseminated gold deposit likely would not be relevant. 105

103

The term “modifying factors” is defined in proposed Item 1301(d)(15) of Regulation S-K. They are the
factors that a qualified person would be required to apply to mineralization or geothermal energy and then
evaluate in order to establish the economic prospects of mineral resources, or the economic viability of
mineral reserves. These factors include, but are not restricted to, mining, energy recovery and conversion,
processing, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, infrastructure, social and
governmental factors. See section II.F.1, infra, for a discussion of the proposed definition of modifying
factors. Under the proposed rules, a qualified person would have to evaluate qualitatively the modifying
factors to demonstrate “reasonable prospects for economic extraction” when determining mineral
resources, but need not undertake the quantitative assessment to establish “economic viability” required for
mineral reserve determination.

104

See Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1301(d)(22).

105

See Instruction 2 to proposed Item 1301(d)(22).

46

The proposed instructions would further state that it is not always necessary for a person
to have five years’ experience in each and every type of deposit in order to be an eligible
qualified person if that person has relevant experience in similar deposit types. For example, a
person with 20 years’ experience in estimating mineral resources for a variety of metalliferous
hard-rock deposit types may not require as much as five years of specific experience in
porphyry-copper deposits to act as a qualified person. Relevant experience in the other deposit
types could count towards the experience in relation to porphyry-copper deposits. 106
In addition to experience in the specific type of mineralization, if the qualified person is
engaged in evaluating exploration results or preparing mineral resource estimates, the proposed
instructions would require the qualified person to have sufficient experience with the sampling
and analytical techniques, as well as extraction and processing techniques, relevant to the
mineral deposit under consideration. As proposed, sufficient experience would mean that level
of experience necessary to be able to identify, with substantial confidence, problems that could
affect the reliability of data and issues associated with processing. 107
For a qualified person applying the modifying factors to convert mineral resources to
mineral reserves, the proposed instructions would require that the person must have both
sufficient knowledge and experience in the application of these factors to the mineral deposit
under consideration and experience with the geology, geostatistics, mining, extraction and
processing that is applicable to the type of mineral and mining under consideration. 108

106

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 1301(d)(22).

107

See Instruction 4 to proposed Item 1301(d)(22).

108

See Instruction 5 to proposed Item 1301(d)(22).

47

These detailed instructions would help ensure that the qualified person has the
appropriate level of experience for both the type of activity involved and the type of mineral
deposit under consideration to make accurate assessments about the registrant’s exploration
results, mineral resources and mineral reserves. At the same time, we believe that the proposed
definition of “qualified person,” taken together with the proposed instructions, would assist
registrants in applying this definition and would provide sufficient flexibility in terms of the
required level of experience and professional standing. Moreover, because the CRIRSCO-based
codes provide similar guidance for the type of experience required for a competent or qualified
person, the proposed definition should not significantly alter existing disclosure practices for
registrants subject to those codes. 109
Request for Comment
32. Should we define a qualified person in part to be a mineral industry professional with at
least five years of relevant experience in the type of mineralization, as described here
and in the proposed rule, and type of deposit under consideration and in the specific
type of activity that person is undertaking on behalf of the registrant, as proposed? Why
or why not? Should we specify the particular type of professional, such as a geologist,
geoscientist or engineer, required under the definition? The years of experience
required under the proposed definition is consistent with the CRIRSCO-based codes. Is
five years the appropriate number of years to constitute the minimum amount of

109

See, e.g., the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards-For Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves (“CIM Definition Standards”) 2 (2010), which is available at:

SAMREC Code pt. 10; the PERC Reporting Standard pt. 10; and the SME Guide pt. 9.

48

relevant experience required under the definition in our rules? Should we require a
lesser or greater number of years of relevant experience (e.g., 3, 7, or 10 years)?
33. Should we define a qualified person to be an individual, as proposed? Or should we
expand the definition, in cases where the registrant engages an outside expert, to include
legal entities, such as an engineering firm licensed by a board authorized by U.S.
federal, state or foreign statute to regulate professionals in mining, geosciences or
related fields? Why or why not? If we expand the definition in this manner, should the
firm or the responsible individual sign the technical report summary and provide the
required written consent? Similarly, what professional experience should be required
and how would a firm satisfy the professional experience requirement? Should we
adopt qualified person requirements for firms that are different than the proposed
requirements for individual qualified persons? If so, what should these requirements be?
34. Do the proposed instructions provide the appropriate guidance for what may constitute
the requisite relevant experience in the particular activity involved and in the particular
type of mineralization and deposit under consideration? Is there different or additional
guidance that we should provide in this regard?
35. Should we define a qualified person in part to be an eligible member or licensee in good
standing of a recognized professional organization at the time the technical report is
prepared, as proposed? Why or why not? Should we require an organization to meet the
six criteria specified in the proposed definition in order to be a recognized professional
organization, as proposed? Should the definition of a qualified person take into account
whether, and the extent to which, a person has been disciplined by their professional
organization? If so, how? Should the definition specify that the organization must
49

require, rather than require or encourage, continuing professional development? Are
there different or additional criteria that we should require for an organization to be a
recognized professional organization?
36. What factors should we consider in determining whether a professional association is
recognized as reputable with regards to the definition of a recognized professional
organization? Are the examples we provided appropriate factors for determining
whether a professional association is recognized as reputable or are other factors more
appropriate? Should any of these factors be incorporated into the final rules?
37. Instead of the proposed flexible approach, should we require that a qualified person be a
member of an approved organization listed in an appendix to the mining disclosure
rules or in a document posted on the Commission’s website? If so, how should the
Commission determine which organizations to approve and how frequently should the
Commission update the approved organization list?
38. Should we, as proposed, require a registrant to disclose the recognized professional
organization(s) that the qualified person is a member of, and confirm that the qualified
person is a member in good standing of the organization(s)?
39. Are there different or additional conditions that a person should have to satisfy in order
to meet the definition of qualified person? For example, should we require that a person
have attained a particular level of formal education (bachelor’s degree, master’s degree,
or doctorate) in order to be a qualified person? If so, what level of education would be
appropriate? Would such a minimum education requirement disqualify a significant
percentage of persons from being considered as qualified persons who otherwise
possess the requisite relevant experience?
50

40. Is the definition of qualified person too restrictive, thus increasing the cost and
difficulty associated with finding a qualified person? Alternatively, should the
definition be more restrictive, to help ensure a qualified person has an appropriate level
of training and expertise? In either case, why?
41. Instead of prescribing qualifications for the qualified person, should we instead require
a registrant to provide detailed disclosure regarding the qualifications of the individual
who prepared the technical report summary? Why or why not?
D.

Treatment of Exploration Results

Neither Guide 7 nor Item 102 addresses the disclosure of exploration results in
Commission filings. 110 In contrast, the CRIRSCO-based codes require the disclosure of material
exploration results, which are defined as data and information generated by mineral exploration
programs that might be of use to investors but which do not form part of a disclosure of mineral
resources or mineral reserves. 111
We are proposing to require that a registrant disclose material exploration results for each
of its material properties. 112 Similar to the CRIRSCO-based codes, we propose to define
exploration results as data and information generated by mineral exploration programs (i.e.,
programs consisting of sampling, drilling, trenching, analytical testing, assaying, and other
similar activities undertaken to locate, investigate, define or delineate a mineral prospect or

110

Accordingly, the staff does not request disclosure of exploration results. If a registrant voluntarily provides
exploration results, the staff will review, and if appropriate, issue comments on, such disclosure.

111

See, e.g., the JORC Code pts. 17, 20 and 31; the SAMREC Code pts. 18-19; the PERC Reporting Standard
pts. 16-18; and the SME Guide pts. 17, 20 and 31.

51

mineral deposit) that are not part of a disclosure of mineral resources or reserves. 113 A proposed
instruction would explain that when determining whether exploration results are material, a
registrant should consider their importance in assessing the value of a material property or in
deciding whether to develop the property. 114 This instruction is consistent with the purpose of
exploration activity, which is to determine whether a mining property contains a deposit that is
economically viable and worth developing or to reduce the uncertainty surrounding that
determination. 115 Prior to establishing the economic viability to an acceptable degree of
certainty, exploration results are also used to assess the potential value of the property. 116 Hence,
we believe that when determining whether exploration results are material, registrants should
consider how the exploration results affect the valuation of a property or the decision to develop
the property.
The proposed rules would preclude the use of exploration results, by themselves, to
derive estimates of tonnage, grade, and production rates, or in an assessment of economic

Handbook 105 (P. Darling, ed., 2011), which states that ”[t]he main objective of minerals exploration is to
locate ore deposits, which are anomalous accumulations of one or more minerals that can be mined at a
profit.”

116

It is accepted industry practice that the presence of mineralization and indications of exploration potential
are factors in valuation of mining properties. See, e.g., Code for the Technical Assessment and Valuation of
Mineral and Petroleum Assets and Securities for Independent Expert Reports (“the VALMIN Code”) pt.
74-79 (2005). Also, relevant accounting principles require valuation to include consideration of the socalled “value beyond proven and probable,” which includes exploration potential. See FASB ASC 930-360
and 930-805 (formerly Emerging Issues Task Force, Fin. Accounting Standards Bd.), EITF Abstracts:
Mining Assets: Impairment and Business Combinations, Issue No. 04-3 (Mar. 17–18, 2004), which is

viability 117 because of the level of risk associated with exploration results. Exploration results,
by themselves, are inherently speculative in that they do not include an assessment of geologic
and grade or quality continuity and overall geologic uncertainty. Therefore, we believe
exploration results are insufficient to support disclosure of estimates of tonnage, grade, or other
quantitative estimates. Tonnage and grades should only be part of mineral resource and reserve
estimates, which must include an assessment of geologic and grade or quality continuity and
overall geologic uncertainty. 118
Despite these limitations, we believe that disclosure of material exploration results would
provide investors with a more comprehensive picture of a registrant’s mining operations and help
them make more informed investment decisions. A company engaged in mining activities
frequently uses exploration results, prior to a determination of mineral resources, to assess the
economic potential of its property as part of its decision to develop a property. In addition, a
company uses exploration results to determine whether mineral resources exist and to estimate
the mineral resources. To the extent that mineral resources (and mineral reserves estimated from
them) on a particular property are material, depending on the facts and circumstances, the
exploration results that led to the estimation of those mineral resources could also be material.
For example, exploration results that have significantly impacted the registrant’s analysis or
estimates of the life of a material mining project would be considered material, thus triggering a
disclosure obligation.
117

See proposed Item 1301(d)(4) of Regulation S-K.

118

Similar restrictions on the use of exploration results exist in the CRIRSCO-based codes. See, e.g.,
CRIRSCO Template pt. 18, which states that “[i]t should be made clear in public reports that contain
Mineral Exploration Results that it is inappropriate to use such information to derive estimates of tonnage
and grade.” See also SME Guide pt. 31 and JORC Code pt. 18.

53

Requiring the disclosure of material exploration results would align our disclosure rules
with most foreign mining codes, 119 which would help to provide for a consistent level of mining
disclosure across relevant jurisdictions. We believe that the potential risk associated with the
uncertainty inherent in exploration results would be mitigated by precluding the use of
exploration results alone, without due consideration of geologic uncertainty and economic
prospects, to serve as a basis for disclosure of tonnage, grade, and production rates, or in an
assessment of economic viability.
At this time, we are not proposing to require the disclosure of exploration results by a
registrant that has material mining operations in the aggregate but no individual properties that
are material. 120 If a company has determined that it lacks material mining properties, we believe
it is unlikely that such a company would have exploration results that are material. While a
company with no material properties could voluntarily elect to disclose exploration results for its
properties, we do not believe investors would benefit from a requirement to disclose exploration
results under those circumstances.
Request for Comment
42. Should we require a registrant to disclose material exploration results for each of its
material properties, as proposed? Why or why not? Alternatively, should we permit
registrants to provide exploration results in a summary form?

119

See note 111, supra.

120

An example of such a registrant would be an industrial minerals company that has more than 50 properties
none of which is individually material. Under the proposed rules, such a company would be required to
provide summary disclosure concerning its mineral resources and mineral reserves. See section II.G.1,
infra.

43. Should we define exploration results as data and information generated by mineral
exploration programs (i.e., programs consisting of sampling, drilling, trenching,
analytical testing, assaying, and other similar activities undertaken to locate, investigate,
define or delineate a mineral prospect or mineral deposit) that do not form part of a
disclosure of mineral resources or reserves, as proposed? Why or why not? Are there
other characteristics that we should include in the definition of exploration results? Are
there other activities that we should include as examples of mineral exploration
programs? Are there activities that we should exclude as examples of mineral
exploration programs?
44. What are the risks that could result from requiring disclosure of material exploration
results? Should we prohibit the use of exploration results to derive estimates of tonnage,
grade, and production rates, or in an assessment of economic viability, as proposed?
Why or why not? Would prohibiting the use of exploration results for these purposes, as
proposed, adequately protect investors from the increased risk associated with including
information having a lower level of certainty about the economic value of mining
properties?
45. When determining whether exploration results are material, should a registrant consider
their importance in assessing the value of a material property or in deciding whether to
develop the property, as proposed? Why or why not? Are there other circumstances
that would better define when exploration results are material? If so, what are those
circumstances?
46. We are proposing to require the disclosure of material exploration results for each
material property. Should we also require disclosure of material exploration results
55

when the registrant has determined that it has in the aggregate material mining
operations but no individual properties are material? Would disclosure of material
exploration results for its properties in the aggregate (when none is individually
material) provide additional meaningful disclosure for investors? If so, how should a
registrant disclose such exploration results? Should it provide such results in summary
form? Or should it provide detailed disclosure about all material exploration results for
all of its properties?
E.

Treatment of Mineral Resources

The determination of mineral resources is the second step, after mineral exploration, that
geoscientists and engineers use to assess the value of a mining property. 121 Most foreign mining
codes require the disclosure of material mineral resources. 122 In contrast, Item 102 and Guide 7
preclude the disclosure of mineral resources in Commission filings (subject to the “foreign or
state law” exception discussed above). 123 According to some industry groups, 124 this restriction
has limited the completeness and relevance of SEC filings.
We are proposing to require a registrant with material mining operations to disclose
specified information in its Securities Act and Exchange Act filings concerning any mineral
resources, as defined in the proposed rules, that have been determined based on information and
121

First, they use the exploration results to determine if a mineral deposit is present. Next, they estimate the
mineral resources, which are the portions of the mineral deposit that have prospects of economic extraction.
The last step is the determination of mineral reserves, which are the economically mineable portions of the
mineral resources.

122

See, e.g., the JORC Code pts. 4 and 14; the SAMREC Code pts. 4 and 14; the SME Guide pts. 3 and 20;
and the PERC Reporting Standard pts. 4 and 13.

supporting documentation from a qualified person. As proposed, a registrant with material
mining operations that has multiple properties would have to provide both summary disclosure
about its mineral resources and more detailed disclosure concerning its mineral resources for
each material property. 125
Under the proposed rules, a registrant could not disclose that it has determined that a
mineral deposit constitutes a “mineral resource” (or, for that matter, a “mineral reserve”) unless
that determination is based upon information and supporting documentation 126 prepared by a
qualified person. Nevertheless, there would be no requirement that a registrant make such an
affirmative determination. For example, a registrant could choose not to engage a qualified
person to conduct the analyses and prepare the documentation necessary to support a
determination that a mineral deposit is a mineral resource (or reserve). In that case, under the
proposed rules, in the absence of such information and supporting documentation, the registrant
would be deemed not to have any mineral resources, and as such, would not be required to
disclose mineral resources in a filing. If, however, the registrant did make the determination that
it had mineral resources based upon information and supporting documentation prepared by a
qualified person (e.g., as part of its efforts to attract investors or secure project financing), then
under the proposed rules the registrant would be required to disclose such mineral resources.
This approach is consistent with the CRIRSCO-based codes. 127
125

See sections II.G.1 and II.G.2, infra, respectively, for a discussion of the proposed summary and individual
property disclosure requirements for mineral resources and reserves.

126

As discussed in sections II.E.3 and II.F.2, infra, by “information and supporting documentation,” we mean
an initial assessment for mineral resource determination and a preliminary or final feasibility study for
mineral reserve determination.

127

Similarly, the other significant mining jurisdictions do not require a registrant to make the determination
that it has mineral resources or reserves, as defined by those codes. The regulatory frameworks do,

57

Requiring a mining registrant with material mining operations to disclose mineral
resources in addition to mineral reserves would provide investors with additional important
information concerning the registrant’s operations and prospects. The importance of this
information is demonstrated by the fact that most foreign mining codes require the disclosure of
mineral resources, U.S. registrants routinely disclose mineral resource information on their
websites, and many mining company analysts consider mineral resource information as an
important factor in their valuations and recommendations. Requiring the disclosure of mineral
resources would also place U.S. registrants on a level playing field with Canadian mining
registrants and non-U.S. mining companies that are subject to one or more of the other
CRIRSCO-based mining codes.
Requiring disclosure of mineral resources in Commission filings could increase the
reporting costs for those mining companies that do not currently disclose mineral resource
information. We believe, however, that any such increase would be minimal as most mining
companies already assess mineral resources in order to determine reserves. 128 Requiring the
disclosure of mineral resources could also increase the possibility that investors may
misunderstand the economic value of a mining company, given that mineral resources are less
certain than mineral reserves. As explained below, however, we believe that this risk is limited

however, require disclosure of mineral resources and mineral reserves once the registrant has made the
determination that it has them and they are material. See, e.g., ASX Listing Rules 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9, which
provide guidance for disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves for “material
mining projects,” and which are available at: http://www.asx.com.au/documents/rules/Chapter05.pdf.
128

Best practice in mining engineering is to first determine the quantity and quality of the material of
economic interest (i.e., mineral resource estimation), prior to engineering and economic evaluation, to
determine if any or all of that material can be extracted economically (i.e., mineral reserve estimation).
See, e.g., Alan C. Noble, “Mineral Resource Estimation,” in 1 SME Mining Engineering Handbook 203 (P.
Darling, ed., 2011), which states “[t]he ore reserve estimate follows the resource estimate.”

58

by the proposed definition of the term mineral resource, by requiring disclosure of the particular
class of mineral resource, and by requiring an initial assessment for mineral resource disclosure.
We also believe that there are potential benefits to investors from the disclosure of mineral
resources, including more comprehensive and potentially more accurate disclosure of mineral
reserves. 129
As previously noted, Item 102 and Guide 7 preclude the disclosure of estimates other
than reserves in SEC filings unless such information is required to be disclosed by foreign or
state law. Since we are proposing to require the disclosure of estimates for mineral resources in
addition to mineral reserves by a registrant with material mining operations, the foreign or state
law exception would no longer be necessary. Therefore, the proposed rules would eliminate this
exception.

resources in addition to mineral reserves, as proposed? Why or why not?

disclosing mineral resources in an SEC filing if it has elected not to engage a qualified
person to make the resource determination? Alternatively, should the rules permit a
registrant to disclose mineral resources in an SEC filing, despite not having engaged a
qualified person to make the resource determination, in certain instances? If so, in what
instances would it be appropriate to permit such disclosure?
1.

Mineral Resource Definition

Because both Item 102 and Guide 7 prohibit the disclosure of non-reserve estimates
except as required under foreign or state law, there currently is no Commission definition of
“mineral resource.” The proposed rules would define “mineral resource” as a concentration or
occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the earth’s crust in such form, grade or
quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for its economic extraction. 130 The
proposed rules would define the term “material of economic interest,” as used in the definition of
mineral resource, to include mineralization, including dumps and tailings, 131 geothermal fields,
mineral brines, and other resources extracted on or within the earth’s crust. As proposed, the
term “material of economic interest” would not include oil and gas resources as defined in
Regulation S-X, 132 gases (e.g. helium and carbon dioxide), or water. 133

130

See proposed Item 1301(d)(14)(i) of Regulation S-K.

131

The term “dumps” refers to stockpiles of mined material. The term “tailings” refers to a mixture of fine
mineral matter and process effluents generated by mineral processing plants.

132

See 17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(16)(D).

133

See proposed Item 1301(d)(14)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

60

The proposed rules would further specify that, when determining the existence of a
mineral resource, a qualified person must be able to estimate or interpret the location, quantity,
grade or quality continuity, and other geological characteristics of the mineral resource from
specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. 134 In addition, when
determining the existence of a mineral resource, as proposed, the qualified person must conclude
that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction of the mineral resource based on an
initial assessment that he or she conducts by qualitatively applying the modifying factors 135
likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction. 136
Similar to the CRIRSCO-based codes, the proposed definition of mineral resource would
state that it is not to be merely an inventory 137 of all mineralization drilled or sampled. 138 A
mineral resource is instead a reasonable estimate of mineralization, taking into account relevant
factors such as cut-off grade, 139 likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, which, with the

134

136

See proposed Item 1301(d)(14)(iii)(B) of Regulation S-K.

137

The term “inventory of mineralization” means an estimate of the total quantity of mineralization based on
the available evidence.

138

See, e.g., JORC Code pt. 20; CRIRSCO International Reporting Template pt. 21; and SAMREC Code pt.
21.

139

The term cut-off grade refers to the grade (the concentration of metal or mineral in rock) at which the
destination of the material changes during mining. For establishing prospects of economic extraction, it is
the grade that distinguishes between the material that is uneconomic and the material that is economic and
therefore going to be mined and processed. Terms with similar meanings include net smelter return, pay
limit and break-even stripping ratio. See Proposed Item 1301(d)(1) of Regulation S-K.

61

assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part,
become economically extractable. 140
As proposed, the definition of mineral resource would include non-solid matter, such as
geothermal fields and mineral brines, in addition to mineralization. We believe this is
appropriate because the scientific and engineering principles used to characterize mineral brine
and geothermal resources and reserves are substantially similar to those used to characterize
solid mineral resources and reserves. By definition, extracting minerals from mineral brines is
mining. 141 Although extracting energy from geothermal fields in the earth’s crust is not identical
to extracting minerals, we believe there are sufficient similarities to justify including geothermal
energy in the proposed rules. For example, the exploration and development techniques leading
to geothermal extraction are similar to the techniques used for mineral extraction. Also, the
extraction of fluid in geothermal fields is similar to in-situ solution mining. 142 In addition,
mineral resource classification frameworks are widely accepted as appropriate for geothermal
resource disclosure. 143

140

See Note to proposed Item 1301(d)(14)(i) of Regulation S-K.

141

Mining can be defined as the “[p]rocess of obtaining useful minerals from the earth’s crust.” Lewis &
Clark, Elements of Mining 20 (1964). Although the CRIRSCO-based codes define a mineral resource as
“solid material” (see, e.g., the CIM Definition Standards at 4 and the JORC code pt. 20), most of those
codes regulate the mining of mineral brines under the same set of rules governing a mineral resource. See
e.g., Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) Notice 43-704, Mineral Brine Projects and National Instrument
43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (July 22, 2011).

142

In-situ solution mining is the selective dissolution and recovery of a target mineral by dissolving the
mineral in its original location and pumping the mineral-laden solution to a processing plant located on the
surface, where the desired metals are produced for market. The solution that dissolves the target mineral is
pumped into the rock via injection wells and the mineral-laden solution is recovered via production wells.
Similarly, extracting energy from geothermal fields involves pumping fluids in and out of geologic
material.

143

For example, the Australian Geothermal Energy Association’s Geothermal Code Committee concluded that
JORC was a better model for the Australian Geothermal Reporting Code than the Society of Petroleum

62

As such, we believe that including these non-solid materials in the proposed definition of
mineral resource would provide a workable and reasonable framework for disclosure related to
these activities. Moreover, including minerals extracted from mineral brines and energy
extracted from geothermal fields within the definition should provide clarity and consistency for
the disclosure obligations of registrants engaged in these activities.
The proposed definition of “mineral resource” also would include dumps and tailings in
recognition of the fact that, under certain circumstances, these byproducts from older mining
operations possess value. We also note that the inclusion of dumps and tailings in the definition
of mineral resource reflects industry practice and is consistent with the CRIRSCO-based
codes. 144
We are proposing to exclude oil and gas resources as defined by Regulation S-X from the
definition of mineral resource because the Commission has adopted separate rules for oil and gas
disclosure. 145 We are proposing to exclude gases (such as helium and carbon dioxide) and water
because the scientific and engineering principles used to estimate these resources are
substantially different from those used to estimate mineral resources.
As noted above, we are proposing to require that in order to classify a deposit as a
resource, a qualified person must establish that there are reasonable prospects of economic
extraction by estimating or interpreting key geological characteristics from specific geological
evidence. We believe that requiring an analysis based on specific geological evidence to
Engineers’ Resources Management System. See J.V. Lawless, M. Ward and G. Beardsmore, “The
Australian Code for Geothermal Reserves and Resources Reporting: Practical Experience,” in Proceedings
of the World Geothermal Congress (2010).

establish prospects of economic extraction would provide an appropriately exacting standard,
and importantly, one that is more exacting than what we propose to require for the disclosure of
exploration results. A qualified person should have a higher level of confidence to determine
that a deposit is properly classified as a mineral resource (which is an estimate of tonnage and
grade that has prospects of economic extraction) than to report exploration results (which may
not indicate the existence of any tonnage with reasonable prospects of economic extraction)
because of the relatively greater weight that investors are likely to place on estimates of mineral
resources. This in turn should help mitigate the uncertainty inherent in the determination of
mineral resources. Moreover, because the CRIRSCO-based codes impose a substantially similar
requirement, we do not believe this aspect of the proposed definition of mineral resources would
significantly alter existing disclosure practices of registrants subject to these codes.

2.

Mineral Resource Classification

The proposed rules would adopt the CRIRSCO-based classification of mineral
resources 147 into inferred, indicated and measured mineral resources, in order of increasing
geological confidence, 148 and define those terms. Further, the proposed rules would require a
registrant with material mining operations to classify its mineral resources into inferred,
indicated and measured mineral resources, in order of increasing confidence based on the level
of underlying geological evidence. We believe this classification requirement would contribute
to the accuracy of a registrant’s mining disclosure in SEC filings, and thereby benefit investors,
because it is based upon an assessment of “geologic uncertainty,” which is the risk related to the
quality, quantity and location of the mineral in the ground. Geologic uncertainty directly impacts
two very significant estimates, production quantities per period and related cash flows, which are
crucial to a registrant’s determination, and an investor’s understanding, of mineral resource
147

See, e.g., JORC Code pt. 20; CRIRSCO International Reporting Template pt. 21; and SAMREC Code pt.
21.

148

See Note to proposed Item 1301(d)(14)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

65

disclosure. We, therefore, believe that the proposed rules should require, and not merely allow,
the classification of mineral resources.
Similar to the CRIRSCO-based codes, 149 we propose to define “inferred mineral
resource” as that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated
on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. 150 The proposed rules would explain
that, as used in this proposed definition, “limited geological evidence” means evidence that is
only sufficient to establish that geological and grade or quality continuity is more likely than not.
The proposed rules would further provide that the level of geological uncertainty associated with
an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply modifying factors in a manner useful for
evaluation of economic viability. 151 Because an inferred mineral resource has the lowest level of
geological confidence of all mineral resources, under the proposed rules, it may not be
considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project and may not be converted
to a mineral reserve. 152
The proposed rules would establish the level of certainty that a qualified person must
strive to achieve when determining the existence of an inferred mineral resource. First, the
qualified person must have a reasonable expectation that the majority of inferred mineral
resources could be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources with continued

66

exploration. Second, the qualified person should be able to defend the basis of this expectation
before his or her peers. 153
We understand that, because inferred mineral resources have the lowest level of geologic
confidence, requiring their disclosure in a mining registrant’s SEC filing could lead to investor
misunderstanding about the nature of a registrant’s mining operations (that would not be present
absent such disclosure). We believe, however, that the proposed definition of inferred mineral
resource 154 would reduce any potential misunderstanding by providing appropriate context for
and limitations on such disclosure. First, the proposed definition would clearly highlight for
investors that inferred mineral resources have the highest degree of uncertainty, allowing
investors to take this into account when assessing a registrant’s disclosure. Second, the proposed
definition would prohibit a registrant from using inferred mineral resources as a basis to
determine mineral reserves. Rather, inferred resources would first have to meet the definitional
requirements of, and be converted into, measured or indicated mineral resources. Only then
would such inferred resources be eligible to be considered as potential mineral reserves under the
proposed rules. This should help limit the incentive for a registrant to be aggressive in disclosing
inferred mineral resources because such disclosure would not increase the likelihood that such
resources would ultimately be deemed to be mineral reserves.
We note that our proposal differs from the CRIRSCO-based codes, which allow a
qualified person to make limited use of inferred mineral resources in his or her technical and

153

154

See proposed Item 1301(d)(10) of Regulation S-K.

economic studies as long as certain cautionary language is included in the disclosure. 155 We
believe, however, that the significant uncertainty associated with estimates of inferred mineral
resources could call into question the results of technical or economic studies based on inferred
mineral resources. As such, we do not believe that any such disclosure would be useful for
investors. 156 Consequently, our proposed rules would prohibit qualified persons from using
inferred mineral resources in any economic analysis conducted to determine the economic
viability of mineral projects or economic prospects of mineral deposits in support of SEC
disclosures.
We propose to define “indicated mineral resource” as that part of a mineral resource for
which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence
and sampling. 157 The proposed rules would explain that, as used in this definition, “adequate
geological evidence” means evidence that is sufficient to establish geological and grade or
quality continuity with reasonable certainty. This means that the level of geological certainty
155

See, e.g., CRIRSCO International Reporting Template pt. 22, which states that “[c]onfidence in the
[inferred mineral resource] estimate is usually not sufficient to allow the results of the application of
technical and economic parameters to be used for detailed planning. For this reason, there is no direct link
from an Inferred Resource to any category of Mineral Reserves. Caution should be exercised if this
category is considered in technical and economic studies.” Also, Canada’s NI 43-101 2.3(3) states, in part,
that “[d]espite paragraph (1)(b), an issuer may disclose the results of a preliminary economic assessment
that includes or is based on inferred mineral resources if the disclosure (a) states with equal prominence
that the preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral
resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to
them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the
preliminary economic assessment will be realized…” See also JORC Code pt. 21 and 38, SAMREC Code
pt. 23, and SME Guide pt. 34, which contain similar cautionary language.

156

The CRIRSCO-based codes may allow the use of inferred resources in lower level technical or economic
studies, but not in higher level studies to support a determination of economic viability. See, e.g., CIM
Definition Standards at 4 (2012) which states that “[c]onfidence in the [inferred mineral resource] estimate
is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an
evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded
from estimates forming the basis of feasibility or other economic studies.”

associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply
modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic
viability of the deposit. 158 The proposed rules would further provide that an indicated mineral
resource has a lower level of confidence than that applicable to a measured mineral resource and
may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve. 159
We propose to define “measured mineral resource” as that part of a mineral resource for
which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence
and sampling. 160 The proposed rules would explain that, as used in this definition, “conclusive
geological evidence” means evidence that is sufficient to test and confirm geological and grade
or quality continuity. This means that the level of geological certainty associated with a
measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in
sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability
of the deposit. 161 The proposed rules would further provide that, because a measured mineral
resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an indicated mineral
resource or an inferred mineral resource, it may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a
probable mineral reserve. 162

The proposed definitions of “indicated mineral resource” and “measured mineral
resource” are substantially similar to the corresponding CRIRSCO-based definitions. We
believe aligning the U.S. definitions with the foreign mining code provisions would benefit
registrants and investors by promoting uniformity in mining disclosure standards. For those
mining registrants that are dual-listed and already subject to the CRIRSCO-based requirements,
such alignment should help to reduce any potential additional costs caused by the proposed
requirement to disclose indicated and measured mineral resources. In addition, some registrants,
even if not currently subject to the CRIRSCO-based requirements, nonetheless apply
substantially similar definitions of indicated and measured mineral resources as part of the
process of determining mineral reserves. 163
As noted above, geologic uncertainty directly affects the uncertainty associated with
production quantities per period and related cash flows. As such, we believe that in addition to
disclosure of resource estimates, it is appropriate to require disclosure of the level of geologic
uncertainty associated with different classes of mineral resources. Specifically, we propose to
require that the qualified person, as part of the initial assessment, 164 quantify and disclose the
uncertainty associated with the production estimates derived from such resources. A qualified
163

As explained in note 128, supra, the best practice in mining engineering is to determine mineral resources,
prior to engineering and economic evaluation, to determine if any or all of those resources can be classified
as mineral reserves. The predominant approach in the mining engineering literature is that mineral
resource classification should be based on the estimator’s judgment of the uncertainty in estimates due to
the geologic uncertainty. See, e.g., JORC pt. 24 and SAMREC pt. 26. This is consistent with our proposed
definitions of mineral resource classifications.

164

We propose to define “initial assessment” as a preliminary technical and economic study of the economic
potential of all or parts of mineralization to support the disclosure of mineral resources. An initial
assessment is different from a pre-feasibility study in that a pre-feasibility study is used to determine
whether all or part of a mineral resource can be converted into a mineral reserve. We discuss the proposed
requirement that the qualified person must conduct at least an initial assessment in order to determine
resources in section II.E.3, infra.

person would be permitted to develop mineral resource estimates using any generally accepted
method, including geostatistics, simulation or inverse distance. Regardless of the method used to
develop resource estimates, however, the qualified person would be required to estimate and
disclose, in the prescribed format, the uncertainty associated with each class of mineral
resource. 165 The appropriate methods for quantifying and disclosing this uncertainty will, as
discussed below, depend upon the specific classification of the resource.
Specifically, for indicated and measured mineral resources, the qualified person would be
required to provide the confidence limits of relative accuracy, 166 at a specific confidence level, of
the preliminarily estimated production quantities per period from the resource. 167 Using this
approach, the geologic uncertainty associated with indicated and measured mineral resources is
stated by keeping any two of the three relevant variables (confidence limits of relative accuracy,
confidence level, and production periods) constant while varying the third. For example, the risk
could be stated as ±15% at 90% confidence for monthly, quarterly or annual production
estimates, or ±10% or ±15% at 90% confidence for annual production estimates.

165

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(13) of Regulation S-K.

166

The term “confidence limits of relative accuracy” refers to the values on both sides of zero (the average
relative accuracy for unbiased mineral resource estimates) that show, for a specified probability (the
confidence level), the range in which the relative accuracy lies. For example, if a report says the
confidence limits of relative accuracy for a mineral resource is ±10% at 90% confidence for annual
production quantities, it means there is a nine out of ten chance that the actual annual production quantities
will be between 90% and 110% of the planned quantities.

167

In this regard, the mining engineering literature makes clear that specifying the confidence limits of relative
accuracy, at a specific confidence level, of production quantities per period is the best way to quantify
uncertainty associated with resources . See, e.g., E. H. Isaaks, and R.M. Srivastava, An Introduction to
Applied Geostatistics 489-513 (1990); and M. E. Rossi, and C. V. Deutsch, Mineral Resource Estimation
209-222 (2014). See generally P. R. Stephenson, Mineral Resource Classification. How the Viability of
Your Project May Hang On a Qualified Person’s Judgment (2011); and P. Stoker and C. Moorhead,
Confidence in Resource Estimates – Beyond Classification (2009).

71

We are proposing 168 that qualified persons report the level of uncertainty for indicated
and measured mineral resources using this approach with the condition that the stated production
period must be monthly, quarterly or annually. 169 This approach for reporting the level of
uncertainty is consistent with what many have suggested in the mining engineering literature to
be best practice. 170 We are not, however, proposing any restrictions on the acceptable
confidence limits of relative accuracy or confidence level required to disclose indicated or
measured mineral resources. In that regard, we recognize that the natural variability of geologic
characteristics is different for different deposits.
When estimating the geologic uncertainty associated with indicated and measured
mineral resources, the qualified person would be required to consider the limitations of the data,
assumptions, and models used to determine the resource estimates. 171 If the qualified person
uses numerical estimates of uncertainty 172 obtained from geostatistical (e.g., kriging) or other

168

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(13) of Regulation S-K.

169

In this regard, we are of the view that the terms “mine planning” and “detailed mine planning,” as used in
the definitions of indicated and measured mineral resources, must incorporate mine plans that include,
respectively, production periods of one year and production periods of less than one year. We are not,
however, proposing to require the qualified person to disclose the exact production quantity per period that
is the basis for the uncertainty disclosure because we recognize that such quantities are preliminary at this
stage and only reflect the qualified person’s judgment of the scale (or size) of the likely mining project.

170

See, e.g., Rossi & Deutsch, supra, note 167 at 209-222; and Stephenson, supra, note 167 at 6-8.

171

See Instruction 4 to proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(13) of Regulation S-K.

172

Although the confidence limits of relative accuracy are expressed in a numeric format, the proposed rules
do not require that a registrant derive such limits mathematically. We note in this regard that the
CRIRSCO-based codes also anticipate that it is not always possible to estimate mathematically the
confidence limits associated with a resource estimate. See, e.g., JORC Code pt. 25, which states “Where a
statement of the relative accuracy and confidence level is not possible, a qualitative discussion of the
uncertainties should be provided in its place.” Also, several authors have suggested alternative approaches
for estimating uncertainty when mathematical estimates of confidence limits are not possible in the mining
engineering literature. See generally, Stephenson, supra, note167, and D. V. Snowden, Practical
Interpretation of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Classification Guidelines (2001).

72

numerical methods (e.g., conditional simulation) when determining the required estimates of
confidence in mineral resources, he or she should consider all the risk factors, including those
risk factors external to such numerical estimation, that will need to be addressed to prevent the
uncertainty disclosure from being materially misleading. Specifically, the qualified person
should consider those risk factors (e.g. reliability of drilling, sampling, or assaying techniques,
and validity of modeling assumptions such as assumptions about geologic structures and
domains) that may raise the level of uncertainty associated with the mineral resource estimate
above the level of uncertainty derived solely from the numerical estimation process. This is
because the numerical estimates of uncertainty from geostatistics or simulation do not account
for risk factors associated with the input such as, but not limited to, drilling or sampling methods,
laboratory assaying methods, outlier treatment, assumptions made during modeling of domains
and geologic controls, compositing (averaging grades over similar sampling volumes or lengths)
and establishing upper limits of grades. Consequently, such numerical estimates may
underestimate the uncertainty associated with the mineral resources. Thus, the qualified person
would need to take into account the impacts of these risk factors and make whatever adjustments
are necessary so that the estimates of confidence limits disclosed are materially complete and
accurate. This could be done, if appropriate, by either expanding the confidence limits or
decreasing the confidence level.
For example, if a qualified person uses geostatistics or simulation to estimate the
uncertainty associated with a particular mineral resource as “±15% relative accuracy at 90%
confidence level for annual production quantities,” then he or she, after determining that the risks
associated with external risk factors are negligible, may report the numerically derived estimate
without adjusting for any external risks. On the other hand, if the qualified person first
73

determines that the risk factors external to the calculation are not negligible, then he or she
would have to adjust the confidence limits to be wider than ±15% or use a confidence level less
than 90% to account for the risk factors external to the calculation. In such case, the specific
confidence limits (e.g., ±25%) or confidence level (e.g. 80%) that would be appropriate depends
on the nature and significance of the risk factors external to the calculation of confidence limits
obtained using numerical methods (e.g., kriging or conditional simulation).
We believe, therefore, that the qualified person should be required to justify, in the
technical report summary, the final estimates of confidence limits he or she uses after adjusting
for the external risk factors. 173 Specifically, whether the qualified person uses numerical
estimates of uncertainty (obtained from geostatistics/simulation) or non-numerical (qualitative)
methods, he or she would be required to support the description of this uncertainty with a list of
all factors considered and explain how those factors contributed to the final conclusion about the
level of risk (confidence limits) underlying the resource classification included in the technical
report summary.
As noted above, a qualified person could use a method such as the inverse distance
method to estimate mineral resources, determining that all the regions of the deposit that were
estimated by means of drill holes with spacing of less than a certain distance are measured
mineral resources. 174 If the qualified person can conclude, based on his or her experience in
similar deposits with similar facts and circumstances, that annual production estimates generated
from these resources will deviate ±15%, nine out of ten times, he or she could then disclose his
173

See Instructions 4 and 5 to proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(13) of Regulation S-K.

174

For example, a qualified person using inverse distance could conclude that the portion of the resource that
is estimated by drill holes 1,300 ft. apart is measured mineral resources.

74

or her confidence in the measured mineral resources of “±15% relative accuracy at 90%
confidence level for annual production quantities.” 175
Unlike the proposed rules, the CRIRSCO-based codes do not require the qualified person
to disclose numerical estimates of the uncertainty associated with the different classes of mineral
resources. Instead, those codes only require the qualified person to report fully the assumptions
and factors considered in classifying mineral resources. 176 The CRIRSCO-based codes do,
however, encourage qualified persons (in some instances) to disclose the level of uncertainty
surrounding estimates where possible. 177 We believe that this optional approach could lead to
disparities in mineral resource classification and confusion for investors. Accordingly, we are
proposing to require the disclosure of numerical estimates of uncertainty, as we believe it would
promote transparency and comparability among registrants about mineral resource classification.

175

See note 172, supra.

176

See, e.g., JORC Code at 30, where the checklist provided for mineral resource classification requires the
qualified person to provide “the basis for the classification of the Mineral Resources into varying
confidence categories [and] whether appropriate account has been taken of all relevant factors (i.e. relative
confidence in tonnage/grade estimations, reliability of input data, confidence in continuity of geology and
metal values, quality, quantity and distribution of the data).” See also CIM’s Estimation of Mineral
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines 19 (2003), which states that “[t]he criteria used
for classification should be described in sufficient detail so that the classification is reproducible by others.”
We are also proposing to require the qualified person to discuss these assumptions in the technical report
summary (see proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(13) of Regulation S-K) and to require the discussion of
these assumptions for first time disclosure of mineral resources or material changes to mineral resource
disclosure in SEC filings (see proposed Item 1304(b)(9) of Regulation S-K).

177

See e.g., JORC Code pt. 25, which states “Competent Persons are encouraged, where appropriate, to
discuss the relative accuracy and confidence level of the Mineral Resource estimates with consideration of
at least sampling, analytical and estimation errors. The statement should specify whether it relates to global
or local estimates, and, if local, state the relevant tonnage. Where a statement of the relative accuracy and
confidence level is not possible, a qualitative discussion of the uncertainties should be provided in its
place.”

75

The disparity in practice in this area and the implications for investors have been
discussed by many authors in the mining engineering literature. 178 In particular, the disparity in
determining the boundary between inferred and indicated mineral resources could significantly
affect a qualified person’s conclusion on whether a project is economically viable or not, since
inferred mineral resources cannot be used in economic analysis. We believe investors would
benefit from greater transparency and more reliable disclosure of the risk associated with each
class of resources by requiring what is now only recommended as best practice by the
CRIRSCO-based codes.
Finally, as regards inferred mineral resources, we believe that they have such a low level
of confidence that it would be inappropriate for a qualified person to use them in production
estimates for a period equal to or shorter than a year. Differences between actual and estimated
production for such periods would have such high standard deviations that they would not
provide an appropriate basis for investment decisions. 179 We are, therefore, proposing to require
qualified persons to state the minimum percentage of inferred mineral resources they believe will
be converted to indicated and measured mineral resources with further exploration. 180

178

See generally P. R. Stephenson, Mineral Resource Classification. How the Viability of Your Project May
Hang On a Qualified Person’s Judgment (2011); and P. Stoker and C. Moorhead, Confidence in Resource
Estimates – Beyond Classification (2009).

179

Possible sources of uncertainty that affect the reporting of inferred resources may include sampling or
drilling methods, data processing and handling, geologic modeling and estimation.

180

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(13) of Regulation S-K. Uncertainty estimates for
inferred mineral resources must be stated in the form “the qualified person expects at least z% of inferred
mineral resources to convert to indicated or measured mineral resources with further exploration and
analysis.”

disclose inferred mineral resources? Are there circumstances that would justify a
qualified person’s use of inferred mineral resources to make a determination about the
economic viability of extraction, or that would allow the conversion of an inferred

the level of risk associated with indicated mineral resources based on the confidence
limits of relative accuracy at a particular confidence level for production estimates for

The initial assessment requirement

As proposed, a registrant’s disclosure of mineral resources must be based upon a
qualified person’s initial assessment supporting the determination of mineral resources. 181 At a
minimum, the qualified person’s initial assessment must include a qualitative evaluation of
modifying factors to establish the economic potential of the mining property or project (i.e., that
there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction of the mineral resource.) We believe that
requiring a well-defined and specific technical study to support disclosure of mineral resources
would provide greater assurance to investors that mineral resource disclosure is reliable.
In connection with the registrant’s disclosure of mineral resources, the proposed rules
would specify that the qualified person must provide the registrant with information and
documentation of the initial assessment that supports a determination of mineral resources. If the
property in question is material to the registrant, the qualified person must also provide the
registrant with a technical report summary that supports the determination of mineral resources.
As proposed, the summary must describe the procedures, findings and conclusions reached for
the initial assessment.
We propose to define an “initial assessment” as a preliminary 182 technical and economic
study of the economic potential of all or parts of mineralization to support the disclosure of
mineral resources. As proposed, the initial assessment must be prepared by a qualified person
181

See proposed Item 1302(c) of Regulation S-K.

182

The term “preliminary” as used in this context refers to a less rigorous study than what is required for
feasibility studies, as defined and discussed in section II.F.2, infra.

80

and must include appropriate assessments of reasonably assumed modifying factors together
with any other relevant operational factors that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of
reporting, that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. 183 The proposed rules
would explain that an initial assessment is required for disclosure of mineral resources but cannot
be used as the basis for disclosure of mineral reserves. 184
An initial assessment, as proposed, is not a scoping 185 or conceptual study as defined in
some of the CRIRSCO-based codes 186 or a preliminary economic assessment as defined in
Canada’s NI 43-101. 187 The purpose of an initial assessment is narrower than those studies as it
would be done solely to support disclosure of mineral resources and not to determine whether to
proceed with further work leading to preparing a pre-feasibility study for reserve determination.
We are proposing instructions to the initial assessment requirement that are designed to
elicit material information concerning the basis for the qualified person’s conclusion that there
are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The first proposed instruction is that an initial
assessment must include cut-off grade estimation, based on assumed unit costs for surface or
underground operations and estimated mineral prices. 188 Cut-off grade refers to the grade at

183

See proposed Item 1301(d)(11)(i) of Regulation S-K.

184

See proposed Item 1301(d)(11)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

185

A scoping study is “an order of magnitude technical and economic study of the potential viability of
Mineral Resources. It includes appropriate assessments of realistically assumed Modifying Factors
together with any other relevant operational factors that are necessary to demonstrate at the time of
reporting that progress to a Pre-Feasibility Study can be reasonably justified.” JORC Code pt. 19 and SME
Guide pt. 48.

186

See, e.g., the SME Guide, Table 2, at 62-63, which provides requirements for scoping, pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies.

188

See proposed Instruction 1 to Item 1302(c) of Regulation S-K.

81

which the destination of the material changes during mining. For purposes of the initial
assessment, it distinguishes between material that is going to the waste dump and material that is
going to the processing plant (in surface mining) or material that is not mined and material mined
to be processed (in underground mining).
We believe that a discussion of cut-off grade is an appropriate requirement for a technical
study that supports mineral resource estimation because, by definition, a mineral resource
estimate is not just an inventory of all mineralization. It is an estimate of that part of the deposit
that has reasonable prospects of economic extraction. 189 We believe the cut-off grade is the best
indicator, at this stage, of such prospects because it requires the qualified person to estimate and
exclude that portion of the deposit that has no reasonable prospects of economic extraction at the
time of the analysis.
As part of the initial assessment, the qualified person would need to assume the cost to
mine a typical unit of the specific material involved. We are not proposing to require the
qualified person to estimate all specific operating and capital costs in detail in order to estimate
unit cost as part of the initial assessment. 190 Rather, for the initial assessment, the proposed rule
requires the qualified person to make assumptions about the two key determinants of cut-off
grade estimation – –operating costs and commodity prices. Any cut-off grade estimation that is

189

See, e.g., CIM Definition Standards at 4 (“A Mineral Resource is an inventory of mineralization that under
realistically assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions might become economically
extractable.”) See also the JORC Code pt. 20 (“Portions of a deposit that do not have reasonable prospects
for eventual economic extraction must not be included in a Mineral Resource”); and the SME Guide pt. 33
(“…a Mineral Resource is not an inventory of all mineralization drilled or sampled …[but] rather it is a
realistic estimate of mineralization which, under assumed and justifiable technical and economic
conditions, might become economically extractable.”)

190

If the qualified person decides to include economic analysis in the initial assessment, then he/she must
include detailed cost estimates. See discussion in section II.E.3, infra.

82

not based upon, or does not disclose, these two assumptions may not fully meet the standard
required to demonstrate reasonable prospects of economic extraction.
As proposed, a qualified person must base the unit cost estimate used in cut-off grade
estimation in an initial assessment on assumed unit costs derived, for example, from historic data
or factoring, for either underground or surface mining. 191 In addition, the qualified person must
make and disclose an assumption about whether the deposit will be mined with underground or
surface mining methods. 192 Given the wide disparity between surface and underground mining
costs, we are concerned that any unit costs estimate that is not specific to one of these two broad
categories of mining methods may not adequately establish the prospects of economic extraction.
When estimating mineral prices for the cut-off grade estimation, the qualified person
would have to use a commodity price that is no higher than the average spot price during the 24month period prior to the end of the last fiscal year, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the daily closing price for each trading day within such period, unless prices are
defined by contractual arrangements. 193 For purposes of consistency, we are proposing that
qualified persons use this same ceiling for all other commodity price estimates in the proposed
mining disclosure for both mineral resources and reserves. 194
Commodity prices used to evaluate mineral resources and reserves should reflect the long
term expectations of the qualified person conducting such analysis. The staff has provided

guidance that commodity prices used in mineral reserve estimation should not exceed a 3-year
trailing average. The use of a trailing average is also the Commission’s standard for oil and gas
reserves (although oil and gas reserves use a 12-month trailing average). 195 By contrast, most
foreign jurisdictions allow the qualified person to use any reasonable and justifiable price, which
is based on the qualified person’s or management’s view of long term market trends. 196
We believe the qualified person must use commodity price estimates that are reasonable
and justifiable and represent long term 197 market trends in mineral resource and reserve
estimation. Such commodity price estimates should account for the current prices and long term
price fluctuations. Since no universal commodity price model exists for predicting long term
prices, we also believe a reasonable ceiling is necessary to ensure mineral resource and reserve
estimates are based on prices that are realistic. The mining engineering literature contains
several models for predicting commodity prices that have varying strengths and weaknesses.

195

See Regulation S-X 4-10(a)(22)(v) (17 CFR 210.4-10(a)(22)(v)).

196

For example, the JORC Code and Canada’s NI 43-101 and CIM Standards call for the qualified person to
report the assumptions underlying price estimates and do not prescribe a price model. See, e.g., the JORC
Code, Table 1 at 32 (requiring the qualified person to report “[t]he derivation of assumptions made of metal
or commodity price(s), for the principal metals, minerals and co-products” under revenue factors.) See also
ASX Listing Rules-Guidance Note 31 pt. 2.4 (“ASX also notes that to the extent that an estimate of mineral
resources or ore reserves involves a representation about future matters, it must be based on reasonable
grounds – meaning that the price, capital expenditure and operational expenditure assumptions used to
calculate the estimates must also be objectively reasonable…”) NI 43-101pt. 3.4(c) requires that a
registrant disclosing mineral resources or reserves must disclose “the key assumptions, parameters, and
methods used to estimate the mineral resources and mineral reserves.” The CIM Best Practice Guidelines
lists [commodity] prices as one such key assumption but provides no guidance on how prices should be
determined except that “if commodity prices used differ from current prices…, an explanation should be
given, including the effect on the economics of the project if current prices were used.” See CIM’s
Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines 30 (2003).

197

“Long term” in this context refers to the life of the mine. See, e.g., David Humphreys, “Pricing and Trading
in Metals and Minerals,” in 1 SME Mining Engineering Handbook, supra note 128, at 49 (stating that the
assumed commodity price should be “the expected annual average price to be achieved for the mined
product during each year of the project’s life.”)

84

Most of these models rely to some degree on historical market prices. There is, however, no
universally agreed upon model for predicting long term commodity prices.
For the purpose of public disclosure, we believe a price model should be transparent,
generally affordable, and promote comparability between mineral resources and reserves of
different registrants. We also believe that the model should provide flexibility to registrants in
selecting a price while helping to ensure that reserve estimates are based on prices that are
realistic.
We believe that a pricing model using historical prices to prescribe a reasonable ceiling
best meets all the stipulated criteria. For exchange-traded commodities, the qualified person
would have to use a price based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the daily closing price
for each trading day within the 24-month period preceding the last day of the fiscal year covered
by the SEC filing. For commodities that are not traded on an exchange, the qualified person
would have to use the 24-month average of prevailing prices in the region as the ceiling.
The sole exception to the 24-month trailing average ceiling price model would be when
registrant has a sales contract in place that has defined the price of the commodity. In that case,
the registrant may use the price stipulated by the sales contracts, provided that such price is
reasonable 198 and the qualified person preparing the resource estimates discloses that he or she is
using a contractual price and discloses the contractual price used. In all cases and regardless of

198

In this context, reasonable means that the contractual price must be a reasonable estimate of the expected
annual average price to be achieved for the mined product during each year of the project’s life. For
example, for a new mine with a 25-year mine life, it would not be reasonable to use a contractual price
(higher than the 24 month trailing average) if the contract price is for only 25% of the mine’s production
for the first six months. In this situation, the contractual price would not be a reasonable estimate of the
expected annual average price over the 25-year mine life.

85

what price is used, the qualified person would have to disclose both the price used and the
justification for such use.
We are proposing an average over a 24-month period because we believe it is more
responsive to price changes, compared to a 3-year average, based on the staff’s experience with
the 3-year average in SEC filings. In this regard, we believe the pricing time frame for mineral
resource and reserve disclosure should be long enough to ensure the average reflects long term
market trends but short enough to prevent the average from lagging behind market trends. On
the one hand, a 3-year average lags farther behind market changes than, and is not as responsive
as, a 2-year average. A 12-month average, on the other hand, could be too volatile and may not
adequately reflect long term trends.
The second proposed instruction to the initial assessment requirement states that the
qualified person must provide a qualitative assessment of all other relevant modifying factors to
establish economic potential and justify why he or she believes that all issues can be resolved
with further exploration and analysis. 199 The relevant modifying factors would include, but not
be limited to, those set forth in the following proposed Table 1. 200

See Table 1 following Instruction 4 to proposed Item 1302(c) of Regulation S-K. The modifying factors
and requirements in Table 1 are modeled on accepted industry practice and supported by the relevant
mining engineering literature. See, e.g., Richard L. Bullock, “Mineral Property Feasibility Studies,” in 1
SME Mining Engineering Handbook, supra, note 115 at 227−261.

As proposed, an initial assessment would be used to support disclosure of mineral resources while a prefeasibility or final feasibility study would be used to support disclosure of mineral reserves. We discuss
feasibility studies in section II.F.2.

The modifying factors, as defined in this section, include, but are not limited to, the factors listed in this table. The number, type and specific
characteristics of the modifying factors applied will necessarily be a function of and depend upon the mineral, mine, property, or project.
Initial assessment, as defined in this section, does not require cash flow analyses or operating and capital cost estimates. The qualified person
may include such cash flow analyses at his or her discretion.
3
Initial assessment does not require an economic analysis, although it requires unit cost assumptions based on an assumption that the resource will
be exploited with surface or underground mining methods. Economic analyses, if included, must only be based on measured and indicated
mineral resources.
2

This table sets forth the proposed minimum requirements for various factors that the
qualified person must evaluate when preparing an initial assessment, pre-feasibility study, or
feasibility study. We are presenting them all in this section, in one table, to facilitate a
comparison of the modifying factors evaluation requirement across the three key technical
studies proposed to be used for mineral resource and reserve disclosure. As this presentation
demonstrates, the proposed modifying factors evaluative process becomes more exacting as
mining property assessment progresses from mineral resource estimation to mineral reserve
estimation.
At the initial assessment stage, as proposed, a qualified person would be required to
evaluate, at a minimum, the following modifying factors:
•

site infrastructure (e.g., whether access to power and site is possible);

•

mine design and planning (e.g., what is the broadly defined mining method);

88

•

processing plant (e.g., whether all products used in the preliminary economic assessment
can be processed with methods consistent with each other);

•

environmental compliance and permitting (e.g., what are the required permits and
corresponding agencies and whether significant obstacles exist to obtaining those
permits); and

•

any other reasonably assumed modifying factors, including socio-economic factors,
necessary to demonstrate reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
We believe a qualitative evaluation of these listed factors, at a minimum, is necessary to

determine the economic potential of a mining property. An assessment of the geological
characteristics of the mined material would not be complete if it did not include a thorough
evaluation and discussion of infrastructure, mine design, processing and environmental issues
that could pose obstacles to the material’s extraction.
To demonstrate the economic feasibility of mining projects, estimates of future cash
flows are necessary because capital expenditures, operating costs and revenues vary over the life
of a mine due to variations in mining conditions. We believe, however, that an initial
assessment, the singular goal of which is to demonstrate reasonable prospects of economic
extraction, not economic viability, need not contain such quantitative analysis.
Nevertheless, if the qualified person would like to demonstrate the economic potential of
the mining property beyond the minimum requirements of an initial assessment 202 by including a
cash flow analysis, we believe such analysis could benefit investors, subject to restrictions.
202

As proposed, the minimum requirements of an initial assessment would consist of cut-off grade estimates,
based on an assumed long term commodity price that is no higher than the 24 month spot price average and
unit cost of production, and qualitative evaluation of other relevant modifying factors.

89

Thus, the third proposed instruction to the initial assessment requirement addresses the option of
providing cash flow analysis as part of the initial assessment. This instruction states that, while a
qualified person may include cash flow analysis in an initial assessment to demonstrate
economic potential, the qualified person may not use inferred mineral resources in such cash
flow analysis. 203 Moreover, if the qualified person includes cash flow analysis in the initial
assessment, then operating and capital cost estimates must have an accuracy level of at least
approximately ±50% 204 and a contingency level of no greater than 25% of the direct estimate. 205
The proposed instruction would provide that the qualified person must state the accuracy and
contingency levels in the initial assessment.
We believe that the proposed prohibition against using inferred mineral resources in an
initial assessment’s cash flow analysis is reasonable because of the high level of geological risk
associated with such mineral resources. We further believe that the proposed accuracy and
contingency requirements 206 for operating and capital costs are appropriate because they are
generally consistent with those accepted for scoping studies. 207

203

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 1302(c) of Regulation S-K.

204

The phrase “accuracy level of at least approximately ±50%” means that the qualified person must have a
reasonable basis to believe that assumptions underlying the estimate will result in actual costs with a
substantial likelihood of being within 50% and 150% of the estimate.

205

The term “contingency” is used to address the level of confidence in the cost estimates. It generally means
the amount “set aside for any additional, unforeseen costs associated with unanticipated geologic
circumstances or engineering conditions.” Scott A. Stebbins, “Cost Estimating for Underground Mines,” in
1 SME Mining Engineering Handbook, supra, note 115, at 270. Thus, a contingency level of ≤25% means
the contingency cannot be more than 25% of the direct cost estimate.

206

As proposed, Table 1 includes both accuracy and contingency requirements for operating and capital cost
estimates.

207

See, e.g., the SME Guide, Table 2, at 62-63, which provides accuracy and contingency ranges for capital
and operating cost estimates in scoping, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies. See also note 185, supra.

90

We do not believe that other quantitative measures of economic potential that omit cash
flows are appropriate and are concerned that they potentially could be misleading. As explained
above, capital expenditures, operating costs and revenues vary over the life of a mine due to
variations in mining conditions. Hence, economic analyses that do not account for these
variations may not tell a complete story. For example, a gross profit evaluation that does not
account for the timing of capital outlays and revenues could indicate that a project is viable, yet
in actuality timely loan repayments may not be possible. Consequently, we are proposing that, to
the extent a qualified person wants to include an economic analysis in an initial assessment, he or
she would only be permitted to use a cash flow analysis; all other quantitative analyses would be
prohibited.
The fourth proposed instruction to the initial assessment requirement refers the qualified
person to Table 1 for the assumptions permitted to be made when preparing the initial
assessment. These include assumptions concerning infrastructure location and the required plant
area, type of power supply, site access roads and camp or town site, production rates, processing
method and plant throughput, post-mining land uses, and plans for tailings disposal, reclamation,
and mitigation. We believe that it is reasonable to permit assumptions to be made for these
factors for the initial assessment. Allowing assumptions for a variety of factors at the resource
determination stage is generally consistent with guidelines under the CRIRSCO-based codes. 208
Moreover, the assumption phase is temporary as the qualified person must substitute most
assumptions with empirical evidence and facts as part of the pre-feasibility or feasibility study
that is required for determining mineral reserves.
208

See, e.g., the SME Guide, Table 1, at 39-61.

Request for Comment
63. Should we require that a registrant’s disclosure of mineral resources be based upon a
qualified person’s initial assessment, which supports the determination of mineral
resources, as proposed? Why or why not? Is there another form of analysis or means of
disclosure that would be more appropriate for the determination and disclosure of
mineral resources? Would disclosure of the material risks associated with mineral
resource determination be an adequate substitute for the initial assessment requirement?
64. If we require an initial assessment to support the determination of mineral resources,
should we define “initial assessment,” as proposed, to require the consideration of
applicable modifying factors and relevant operational factors for the purpose of
determining (at the resource evaluation stage) whether there are reasonable prospects
for economic extraction? Should we instead only require consideration of modifying
and operational factors at the reserve determination stage?
65. Should we require an initial assessment to include cut-off grade estimation, as
proposed? Why or why not?
66. Should we require a qualified person to base cut-off grade estimation on assumed unit
costs for surface or underground operations, as proposed? Is it appropriate to allow the
qualified person to make an assumption about unit costs, as proposed, or should we
require a more detailed estimate of unit costs at the resource determination stage? Is it
appropriate to require the qualified person to disclose whether the unit cost estimates
are for surface or underground operations, as proposed?
67. Should we also require a qualified person to base cut-off grade estimation on estimated
mineral prices, as proposed? In this regard, should we require the qualified person to
92

use a commodity price that is no higher than the average spot price during the 24-month
period prior to the end of the last fiscal year, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the daily closing price for each trading day within such period, unless prices
are defined by contractual arrangements, as proposed? Does a ceiling model based on
historical prices best meet the goals of transparency, cost efficiency and comparability?
Why or why not? Is there another model that would better meet these goals? If another
price model better meets these goals, what should be the basis of estimated mineral
prices for purposes of the initial assessment? Whatever price model we adopt, should it
be used to determine the commodity price itself? Or should it be used, as proposed, to
determine the ceiling of the commodity prices?
68. Is the proposed 24-month period the most appropriate period for the estimated price
requirement? Would a 12, 18, 30, or 36-month period, or some other duration, be more
appropriate? Should the 24-month period, or other period be fixed and apply to all
registrants, or should the period vary depending upon the type of commodity being
mined and other factors?
69. Should we require, as proposed, the same ceiling price for mineral resource and reserve
estimation? If not, how should the prices used for mineral resource and reserve
estimation differ? Would such criteria meet the goals of transparency, cost efficiency
and comparability?
70. Should we require that for purposes of the initial assessment a qualified person must
provide at least a qualitative assessment of all relevant modifying factors to establish
economic potential and justify why he or she believes that all issues can be resolved
with further exploration and analysis, as proposed? Are the modifying factors provided
93

as examples in the proposed instruction and table the most appropriate factors to be
included? Are there other factors that should be specified in the instruction and table in
lieu of or in addition to the mentioned factors? Would presentation of the modifying
factors in a table benefit investors, registrants and qualified persons?
71. Should we permit the qualified person to make assumptions about the modifying factors
set forth in the proposed table at the resource determination stage, as proposed? Why or
why not? Are there other assumptions that we should specify in lieu of or in addition to
those already mentioned in the proposed table?
72. Should we permit a qualified person to include cash flow analysis in an initial
assessment to demonstrate economic potential, as proposed? Why or why not? If we
should permit cash flow analysis in an initial assessment, should we require that
operating and capital cost estimates in the analysis have an accuracy level of at least
±50% and a contingency level of ≤25%, as proposed? If not, what should the accuracy
and contingency levels be? Should we require the qualified person to state the accuracy
and contingency levels in the initial assessment?
73. If we permit cash flow analysis in the initial assessment, should we prohibit the
qualified person from using inferred mineral resources in the cash flow analysis, as
proposed? Why or why not? Would there be disadvantages to registrants or investors if
the use of inferred mineral resources in an initial assessment’s cash flow analysis is
prohibited? Would there be advantages to prohibiting the use of inferred resources in
an initial assessment’s cash flow analysis in the initial assessment?
74. Should we prohibit the use of an initial assessment to support a determination of
mineral reserves, as proposed? Why or why not?

USGS Circular 831 and 891

In 1980, the US Geological Survey (“USGS”) published Circular 831 as an update to
USGS Bulletin 1450-A –– “Principles of the Mineral Resource Classification System of the U.S.
Bureau of Mines and U.S. Geological Survey.” In 1983, the USGS published Circular 891 –
“Coal Resource Classification System of the U.S. Geological Survey,” specifically for resource
or reserve classification of coal. 209 Consistent with the mission of the USGS, these circulars
were mostly suitable for national and regional level reporting of mineral resources and reserves
for government planning purposes, 210 and were not intended to be the basis for public company
disclosure to investors. Both circulars have been used by companies to classify coal and
industrial minerals resources in the United States. 211
In the past, the staff has not objected to mineral reserve disclosure that used these
circulars to classify mineral resources as inferred, indicated or measured resources. 212 We do not

See USGS Circular 891 1 (1983), which states that “In 1980, the [USGS and Bureau of Mines] published
Circular 831… The circular, which outlines a classification system for all mineral commodities, filled the
classification needs of the Bureau of Mines, which was no longer responsible for coal resource
classification, and was the basis for this revision of the coal resource classification system by the
Geological Survey. The revision, embodied in this report, has two main objectives: (1) to provide detailed
information lacking in Bulletin 1450-B; and (2) to provide standard definitions, criteria, guidelines, and
methods required for uniform application of the principles outlined in Circular 831.” Gordon H.Wood, Jr
et. al., U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, Coal Resource Reclassification System of the
U.S. Geological Survey, USGS Circular 891 (1983), which is available at:
http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1983/0891/report.pdf.

211

Although Circular 831’s classification system has been largely phased out in metal mining, it is still
commonly used in coal and some industrial minerals mining.

212

Guide 7 prohibits mineral resource disclosure and as such does not provide any guidance (or place any
restrictions) on how to classify mineral resources.

95

believe the use of USGS Circulars 831 and 891 for resource classification in SEC filings would
be consistent with the proposed rules. We believe that the CRIRSCO-based mineral resource
classification scheme, upon which our proposed mineral resource disclosure rules are modeled,
would provide a more appropriate basis for disclosure about a registrant’s mineral resources. 213
In contrast to the Circular’s classification system, the proposed definitions require that all
disclosed mineral resources must have reasonable prospects of economic extraction. Moreover,
the primary criterion for the required mineral resource classification in our proposed rules is the
geologic confidence in the estimates based on the geologic evidence (limited, adequate or
conclusive). This is in contrast to the primary criterion in the Circulars, which is essentially the
extent to which tonnages fall within particular distances from a drill hole or outcrop. Although
drill hole spacing may be a factor that informs the qualified person’s assessment of geologic
confidence, for the purposes of public company disclosure to investors, we do not believe it
should be the sole factor. 214
Request for Comment
75. Are we correct in thinking that use of Circulars 831 and 891 to classify mineral
resources would not be appropriate under the proposed rules? Why or why not?

213

The Circulars prescribe strict guidelines to classify mineral resources based on the distance from a drill
hole (“drill hole spacing”) that do not vary depending on the complexity and specific facts of the deposit.
For example, these Circulars define measured (0- to ¼-mile), indicated (¼ to ¾-mile) and inferred (¾- to 3miles) mineral resources based on drill hole (or outcrop) radii.

214

See, e.g., Ricardo A. Olea and James A. Luppens, “Modeling Uncertainty in Coal Resource Assessments,
With an Application to a Central Area of the Gillette Coal Field,” in USGS Scientific Investigations Report
2014–5196 1 (2014) (which concluded that an approach that involved establishing confidence limits,
similar to the approach used in our proposal, “should be considered realistic improvements over distance
methods used for quantitative classification of uncertainty in coal resource, such as U.S. Geological Survey
Circular 891”).

Treatment of Mineral Reserves

Guide 7 defines a mineral reserve as “that part of a mineral deposit which could be
economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.” 215 The
Guide does not, however, delineate the factors that must be considered when making a reserve
determination. In contrast, other jurisdictions have adopted the CRIRSCO framework whereby
the determination of mineral reserves occurs by applying and evaluating specifically defined
“modifying factors” 216 to indicated and measured mineral resources. 217
In addition, the CRIRSCO-based codes permit the use of either a preliminary feasibility
study or feasibility study 218 to establish the economic viability of extraction. 219 Although Guide
7 does not address the issue, the staff has historically requested that registrants provide a final
feasibility study to support the determination and disclosure of mineral reserves.
These differences between the staff’s guidance and the CRIRSCO standards, the latter of
which have become widely-accepted in industry practice, may have been a source of confusion
for registrants and investors. 220 To address this situation, we propose to revise the definition of
mineral reserves to align it generally with the definition under the CRIRSCO-based standards by:

215

Paragraph (a)(1) of Guide 7.

216

The modifying factors applied in this context are the same as the modifying factors applied in the context
of the determination of mineral resources. See note 103, supra.

217

See, e.g., the CIM Definition Standards at 5-6; the JORC Code pts. 30-31; the SME Guide pts. 40-41; the
SAMREC Code pts. 33-34; and the PERC Reporting Standard pts. 30-31.

218

A preliminary feasibility study is also called a pre-feasibility study. A feasibility study is also called a full,
final, comprehensive, or bankable feasibility study.

219

See, e.g., the CIM Definition Standards at p. 5; the JORC Code pt. 29; the SME Guide pt. 39; the
SAMREC Code pt. 32; and the PERC Reporting Standard pt. 29.

See, e.g., the SME Petition for Rulemaking at 2, which states, “The SEC’s Industry Guide 7 is substantially
different from these standards… [and] has caused much confusion among mining companies and their

97

•

adopting the framework of applying modifying factors to indicated or measured mineral
resources in order to convert them to mineral reserves; and

•

permitting either a pre-feasibility or feasibility study to provide the basis for determining
and reporting mineral reserves.
1.

The framework for determining mineral reserves

We propose to establish a framework for mineral reserves determination and disclosure
that is based on the following proposed definitions of “mineral reserves,” “probable mineral
reserves,” “proven mineral reserves,” and “modifying factors.”
We propose to define “mineral reserve” as an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of
indicated or measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the
basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, as proposed, a mineral reserve is the
economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, net of allowances for
diluting materials and for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. 221
Under the proposed rules, the determination that part of a measured or indicated mineral
resource is economically mineable would have to be based on a preliminary feasibility (prefeasibility) or feasibility study conducted by a qualified person applying the modifying factors to
indicated or measured mineral resources. Such study would have to demonstrate that, at the time
of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable
investment and market assumptions. Moreover, the study would have to establish a life of mine

investors.”
221

See proposed Item 1301(d)(13)(i) of Regulation S-K.

98

plan that is technically achievable and economically viable, which would be the basis of
determining the mineral reserve. 222
The proposed rules would provide that, as used in the definition of mineral reserve,
“economically viable” means that the qualified person has determined, using a discounted cash
flow analysis, or has otherwise analytically determined, that extraction of the mineral reserve is
economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. 223 The proposed
rules would further explain that, as used in this definition, “investment and market assumptions”
includes all assumptions made about the prices, exchange rates, sales volumes and costs that are
necessary and are used to determine the economic viability of the reserves. 224
As proposed, the price used to determine the economic viability of the mineral reserves
could not be higher than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of the
fiscal year covered by the study, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the daily
closing price for each trading day within such period, except in cases where sales prices are
determined by contractual agreements. In such a case, the qualified person would be able to use
the price set by the contractual arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable 225 and the

222

See proposed Item 1301(d)(13)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

223

See proposed Item 1301(d)(13)(iii) of Regulation S-K. Whether the investment and market assumptions
are “reasonable” will necessarily be a facts and circumstances determination based upon the relevant
economic and market factors.

224

See proposed Item 1301(d)(13)(iv) of Regulation S-K.

See note 198 for a discussion of when a contractual price may not be a reasonable estimate of the expected
annual average price to be achieved for the mined product during each year of the project’s life.

99

qualified person discloses that he or she is using a contractual price and discloses the contractual
price used. 226
The proposed rules would adopt the CRIRSCO classification scheme and framework for
mineral reserve determination, which subdivides mineral reserves, in order of increasing
confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors to the indicated
and measured mineral resources, into probable mineral reserves and proven mineral reserves. 227
Similar to the CRIRSCO classification scheme, 228 we propose to define “probable mineral
reserves” as the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured
mineral resource. 229
The proposed rules would explain that, for a probable mineral reserve, the qualified
person’s confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in
the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality is lower than what is sufficient for a classification
as a proven mineral reserve, but is still sufficient to demonstrate that, at the time of reporting,
extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market
assumptions. 230 This lower level of confidence can be due either to higher geologic uncertainty
when the qualified person converts an indicated mineral resource to a probable mineral reserve
or higher risk in the results of the application of modifying factors at the time when the qualified
person converts a measured mineral resource to a probable mineral reserve. The proposed rules

would further require that a qualified person classify a measured mineral resource as a probable
mineral reserve when his or her confidence in the results obtained from the application of the
modifying factors to the measured mineral resource is lower than what is sufficient for a proven
mineral reserve. 231
Similar to the CRIRSCO classification scheme, 232 we propose to define “proven mineral
reserves” as the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. 233 The proposed
rules would explain that, for a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person must have a high
degree of confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in
the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality. 234 In addition, as proposed, a proven mineral
reserve can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource. 235
We propose to define “modifying factors” as the factors that a qualified person must
apply to mineralization or geothermal energy and then evaluate in order to establish the
economic prospects of mineral resources, or the economic viability of mineral reserves. 236
Similar to the CRIRSCO framework, a qualified person would have to apply and evaluate
modifying factors to convert measured and indicated mineral resources to proven and probable
mineral reserves. 237 These factors would include, but not be restricted to, mining, energy

recovery and conversion, processing, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental,
infrastructure, social and governmental factors. The number, type and specific characteristics of
the modifying factors that are applied would be a function of and depend upon the mineral, mine,
property, or project. 238
For example, applying and evaluating processing factors means the qualified person must
examine the characteristics of the mineral resource and determine that the material can be
processed economically into saleable product using existing technology. Similarly, applying and
evaluating legal factors means the qualified person must examine the regulatory regime of the
host jurisdiction to establish that the registrant can comply (fully and economically) with all laws
and regulations (e.g., mining, environmental, reclamation and permitting regulations) that are
relevant to operating a mineral project using existing technology. The only estimates of grade or
quality and tonnages that a registrant can disclose as mineral reserves are those parts of the
indicated and measured mineral resources that, after all such relevant factors have been
evaluated, can be shown to be part of a viable mineral project.
We also are proposing several instructions about the conversion of mineral resources into
mineral reserves. 239 For example, one instruction would explain that, similar to the CRIRSCO
framework, 240 if the uncertainties in the results obtained from the application of the modifying
factors, which prevented a measured mineral resource from being converted to a proven mineral

We discuss additional instructions about the conversion of mineral resources into mineral reserves in the
discussion of the requirements for pre-feasibility and feasibility studies below. See section II.F.2, infra.

reserve, no longer exist, then the qualified person may convert the measured mineral resource to
a proven mineral reserve. 241
Another instruction would state that a qualified person cannot convert an indicated
mineral resource to a proven mineral reserve unless there is new evidence that justifies
conversion of the indicated mineral resource to a measured mineral resource. 242 A third
instruction would explain that a qualified person cannot convert an inferred mineral resource to a
mineral reserve without first obtaining new evidence that justifies converting it to an indicated or
measured mineral resource. 243 These instructions are consistent with the CRIRSCO framework
for conversion of mineral resources into mineral reserves. 244
The proposed framework would require a registrant’s disclosure of mineral reserves to be
based on a qualified person’s detailed evaluation of the modifying factors as applied to indicated
or measured mineral resources, which would demonstrate the economic viability of the mining
property or project. 245 The proposed instructions would describe the relationship between the
different classes of mineral resources and reserves and underscore the incremental nature of
mineral resource and reserve determination. For example, a qualified person would not be able
to use inferred mineral resources to support a determination of mineral reserves unless new
evidence (e.g., data and analysis) has first caused an increased confidence in the geologic

evidence 246 sufficient to reclassify those resources as indicated or measured mineral resources.
Similarly, a qualified person would not be able to convert an indicated mineral resource to a
proven mineral reserve without first determining that conclusive, rather than just adequate,
geological evidence exists to support reclassification to a measured mineral resource.
This proposed framework for mineral reserve determination and disclosure would be
more detailed and structured than Guide 7’s approach. Although Guide 7 similarly defines a
mineral reserve as that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or
produced, it does not specify the level of geologic evidence that must exist or the factors that
must be considered to convert the deposit to a mineral reserve.
In contrast, the proposed framework would only permit estimates of mineral reserves that
result from the conversion of indicated and measured mineral resources for which adequate and
conclusive geologic evidence exist. It would also prohibit the use of inferred mineral resources,
for which there is only limited geologic evidence, to support a determination of mineral reserves.
Finally, the proposed framework would require the qualified person to disclose the specific
mining, processing, metallurgical, environmental, economic, legal and other applicable factors,
the detailed evaluation of which has led the qualified person to conclude that extraction of the
mineral reserve is economically viable.
As a result, we believe that the proposed framework would result in clearer and more
accurate disclosure about the economic viability of a registrant’s mineral deposits, which would
benefit investors. The proposed framework would also be substantially similar to the CRIRSCO
framework. As such, its adoption should enhance consistency in mining disclosure across
246

See the definitions of limited, adequate and conclusive geologic evidence under the respective definitions
of inferred, indicated and measure mineral resource in proposed Item 1301(d) of Regulation S-K.

104

jurisdictions, facilitating comparability for investors. It also would reduce reporting costs for the
numerous mining registrants that are dual-listed and have been subject to different U.S. and
CRIRSCO-based disclosure requirements. The main difference between the proposed framework
for determining mineral reserves and the CRIRSCO framework is the requirement to use
commodity prices that are no higher than the 24-month trailing average.
We are proposing a definition of mineral reserve as an estimate of tonnage and grade or
quality that is net of allowances for diluting materials and mining losses. This is in contrast to
the definition of mineral reserve under the CRIRSCO standards, which includes diluting
materials in reserve estimates. We are proposing a net estimate for reserves because our
proposed rules would require disclosure of mineral reserves at three points of reference: insitu, 247 plant or mill feed, and saleable product. 248 We believe estimates that are exclusive of
diluting materials and mining losses would provide a clearer picture of the efficiency of the
processing method, which we believe is important for investors. 249 Because this difference is
relatively minor (excluding diluting materials is a minor computational step in reserve
estimation), we do not believe it would impose a significant additional compliance burden for
registrants.

247

In-situ means “in its original place.” It is used in this context to refer to mineral reserves estimated as inplace tons.

248

See proposed Item 1304(b)(7) of Regulation S-K and Instruction 4 to proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(14)
of Regulation S-K.

249

The efficiency of the processing method demonstrates how well the registrant converts the resource into
saleable products.

105

As discussed in greater detail below, 250 under the proposed rules, a qualified person’s
determination of mineral reserves would have to be based on either a preliminary (prefeasibility) or feasibility study. In either case, the required technical study would have to include
a technically and economically feasible life of mine plan that supports the study’s demonstration
that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under
reasonable investment and market assumptions. We are including this life of mine requirement
to provide clear guidance concerning the determination of mineral reserves to qualified persons
and registrants. We do note, however, that many registrants already conduct life of mine plans to
support their reserve disclosure. 251
As proposed, the qualified person must demonstrate economic viability by conducting a
discounted cash flow analysis or other similar financial analysis using a commodity price that is
no higher than the 24 month trailing average price model proposed for the determination of
mineral resources. 252
When discussing the analysis in the technical report summary, the qualified person must
disclose the assumptions made about prices, exchange rates, discount rate, sales volumes and
250

See section II.F.2, infra.

251

In this regard, we note that the SME Guide expressly requires a life of mine plan in its technical study. See
the SME Guide, Table 1, at 49 (“Mining method(s), mine plans and production schedules defined for the
life of the project” are required to support mineral reserve disclosure.) Under the CRIRSCO-based codes,
the qualified person has to develop mine plans in order to estimate cash flows, which are required by the
codes for the financial analysis necessary to support mineral reserve disclosure. The cash flows must be
based on costs and revenues associated with planned production over the life of the project. See JORC pt.
29, which states that “[d]eriving an Ore Reserve without a mine design or mine plan through a process of
factoring of the Mineral Resource is unacceptable… The studies will have determined a mine plan and
production schedule that is technically achievable and economically viable and from which the Ore
Reserves can be derived.”

252

Consistent with this proposed requirement, the proposed rules would not permit a registrant to provide a
supplemental mineral reserve determination (i.e., an estimate based upon a price higher than the 24 month
trailing average).

106

costs necessary to determine the economic viability of the reserves. 253 The proposed
requirement to conduct a discounted cash flow or other similar analysis is consistent with the
requirement under the CRIRSCO-based codes that mineral reserve determination must be based
on a financial analysis under reasonable assumptions demonstrating that extraction of the reserve
is economically viable. 254 In addition, the staff has historically requested such financial analysis
to support disclosure of mineral reserves. As such, it should not significantly alter existing
disclosure practices.
Request for Comment
76. Should we establish a framework for mineral reserves determination and disclosure, as
proposed? Why or why not? Is there another framework that would be preferable to
the proposed framework? If so, what would be the advantages and disadvantages of the
alternative framework?
77. Should we define “mineral reserve,” as proposed? Are there conditions that we should
include in the definition of mineral reserves instead of, or in addition to, those proposed
to be included in the definition? Are there any conditions that we should exclude from
the definition of mineral reserves? For example, should we modify the condition that
mineral reserves be based on a pre-feasibility or feasibility study to only permit a
feasibility study? Should we exclude in its entirety the condition that mineral reserves be
based on a feasibility or pre-feasibility study? Are there terms that we should define
253

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(21).

254

See, e.g., the SME Guide pt. 39 (“The term ‘economically viable’ implies that extraction of the Mineral
Reserve has been determined or analytically demonstrated (e.g., such as by a cash flow in the report) to be
viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions.”) See also the JORC Code pt.

to be viable under reasonable financial assumptions”).

differently? For example, should we define a mineral reserve as an estimate of tonnage
and grade or quality that includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, instead of
a net estimate, as proposed? Why or why not?
78. Should we explicitly include a life of mine plan disclosure requirement in the technical
studies required to support a determination of mineral reserves, as proposed? Why or
why not?
79. Should we require the use of a discounted cash flow analysis or other similar analysis to
establish the economic viability of a mineral reserve’s extraction, as proposed? Why or
why not? If so, should we require the use of a price that is no higher than a trailing 24
month average spot price in the discounted cash flow analysis, except in cases where
sales prices are determined by contractual agreements, as proposed? Is there some other
period (e.g., 12 or 36 months) or measure that should determine the price used in the
discounted cash flow analysis?
80. Should we allow registrants to use an alternate price in addition to a price that is no
higher than a trailing 24 month average spot price, as long as they disclose the alternate
price and their justification? Alternatively, should we require every registrant to use a
fixed 24 month trailing average price with the option to use an alternate price(s) that is
reasonably achieved? Are there other pricing methods (e.g., management’s long term
view or using spot, forward or futures prices at the end of the last fiscal year to
determine the ceiling price allowed) that we should require or permit registrants to use
in discounted cash flow analysis? Would such pricing methods be transparent, easy for
registrants to apply and investors to understand, and to the extent practicable, provide
some degree of comparability?
108

81. Should we define the terms “probable mineral reserve” and “proven mineral resource,”
as proposed? Why or why not? If not, how should we modify these definitions?
82. Should we define “modifying factors,” as proposed? Are there any factors that we
should include in the definition of modifying factors instead of or in addition to those
already included in the definition? Are there any factors that we should exclude from
the definition?
83. Should we adopt the above discussed instructions, as proposed? Why or why not?

The type of study required to support a reserve determination
i.

Preliminary feasibility study

Like the CRIRSCO framework for mineral reserve determination the proposed rules
would require either a preliminary feasibility study or a feasibility study in support of a
determination of mineral reserves. 255 We propose to define a “preliminary feasibility study” (or
“pre-feasibility study”) as a comprehensive study of a range of options for the technical and
economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a qualified person has
determined (in the case of underground mining) a preferred mining method, or (in the case of
surface mining) a pit configuration, and in all cases has determined an effective method of
mineral processing and an effective plan to sell the product. 256
The proposed rules would further provide that a pre-feasibility study must include a
financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions, based on appropriate testing, about the

255

See proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K.

256

See proposed Item 1301(d)(16)(i) of Regulation S-K. This proposed definition is similar to the comparable
definition under the CRIRSCO-based codes. See, e.g., JORC Code pt. 39; CRIRSCO International
Reporting Template pt. 38; and SAMREC Code at p. 3.

109

modifying factors and the evaluation of any other relevant factors that are sufficient for a
qualified person to determine if all or part of the indicated and measured mineral resources may
be converted to mineral reserves at the time of reporting. The study’s financial analysis must
have the level of detail necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is
economically viable. 257 The proposed rules would also note that, while a pre-feasibility study is
less comprehensive and results in a lower confidence level than a feasibility study, a prefeasibility study is more comprehensive and results in a higher confidence level than an initial
assessment. 258
As discussed in greater detail below, we propose to define a “feasibility study” 259 as a
comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral
project, which includes detailed assessments of all applicable modifying factors together with
any other relevant operational factors, and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is economically viable. 260 The proposed
rules would further provide that, similar to the CRIRSCO framework, 261 a feasibility study is
more comprehensive, with a higher degree of accuracy, and yielding results with a higher level
of confidence, than a pre-feasibility study. Under the proposed rules, it must contain mining,

equivalent to a feasibility study. See Note to proposed Item 1301(d)(7) of Regulation S-K.

See proposed Item 1301(d)(7)(i) of Regulation S-K. This proposed definition is similar to the comparable
definition under the CRIRSCO-based codes. See, e.g., JORC Code pt. 40; CRIRSCO International
Reporting Template pt. 39; and SAMREC Code at p. 2.

infrastructure, and process designs completed with sufficient rigor to serve as the basis for an
investment decision or to support project financing. 262
As proposed, the key differences between a pre-feasibility study and a final or bankable
feasibility study are:
•

a pre-feasibility study discusses a “range of options” for the technical and economic
viability of a mineral project whereas a final feasibility study focuses on a
particular option selected for the development of the project;

•

a pre-feasibility study generally has a less detailed assessment of the modifying factors
necessary to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable than the corresponding
assessment in a final feasibility study; and

•

a pre-feasibility study generally has a less detailed financial analysis that is based on
less firm budgetary considerations (e.g., historical costs rather than actual, firm
quotations for major capital items) and more assumptions than the financial analysis in
a final feasibility study.
Despite these differences, we believe that revising our rules to allow a pre-feasibility

study to support the determination and disclosure of mineral reserves is appropriate because of
the expected resulting benefits for both registrants and investors. Permitting the use of a prefeasibility study to determine mineral reserves under our rules would align the Commission’s
disclosure regime with those under the CRIRSCO-based codes and, as such, provide greater
uniformity in global mining disclosure requirements to the benefit of both mining registrants and

262

See proposed Item 1301(d)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-K; see also Note to proposed Item 1301(d)(7)(ii) of
Regulation S-K.

111

their investors. Permitting the use of a pre-feasibility study could also significantly reduce a
mining registrant’s costs in connection with the determination of mineral reserves.
Although the use of a pre-feasibility study could increase the uncertainty regarding a
registrant’s disclosure about mineral reserves, we believe that any such uncertainty would be
reduced by the requirements included in the proposed definitions and corresponding proposed
instructions.
First, as proposed, the pre-feasibility study must include a financial analysis at a level of
detail sufficient to demonstrate the economic viability of extraction. A proposed instruction
would state that the pre-feasibility study must include an economic analysis that supports the
property’s economic viability as assessed by a detailed discounted cash flow analysis. 263 This
economic analysis must describe in detail applicable taxes and provide an estimate of revenues,
which in certain situations (e.g. where the products are not traded on an exchange or no
established market or sales contract exists) must be based on at least a preliminary market
study. 264 We believe that this proposed level of detail for the economic analysis in a prefeasibility study is consistent with current practice in the industry and comparable to the

263

See Instruction 4 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K.

264

As defined in proposed Item 1301(d)(17) of Regulation S-K, a preliminary market study is a study that is
sufficiently rigorous and comprehensive to determine and support the existence of a readily accessible
market for the mineral. It must, at a minimum, include product specifications based on preliminary
geologic and metallurgical testing, supply and demand forecasts, historical prices for the preceding five or
more years, estimated long term prices, evaluation of competitors (including products and estimates of
production volumes, sales, and prices), customer evaluation of product specifications, and market entry
strategies. The study must provide justification for all assumptions. It can, however, be less rigorous and
comprehensive than a final market study, which is required for a full feasibility study.

112

requirements for mineral reserve disclosure based on a pre-feasibility study in the CRIRSCObased jurisdictions. 265
Second, the proposed rules would require a qualified person to include the justification
for using a pre-feasibility study, if one is used, instead of a final feasibility study. 266 This
requirement would help ensure that investors are fully informed of the qualified person’s basis
for determining that a pre-feasibility study is adequate given the particular facts and
circumstances. It also should encourage a qualified person to consider carefully his or her
decision to use a pre-feasibility study to support the determination of mineral reserves.
Third, another proposed instruction would require the use of a final feasibility study in
high risk situations. 267 For example, a final feasibility study would be required in situations
where the project is the first in a particular mining district with substantially different conditions
than existing company projects, such as environmental and permitting restrictions, labor
availability and skills, remoteness, and unique mineralization and recovery methods. 268 In such
cases, the qualified person would have to use a feasibility study in order to achieve the level of
confidence necessary for disclosing mineral reserves because, as discussed above, a prefeasibility study is less comprehensive and yields results with a lower level of confidence than a
265

For example, the CIM Definition Standards at 3 states that the standard “requires the completion of a
Preliminary Feasibility Study as the minimum prerequisite for the conversion of Mineral Resources to
Mineral Reserves.” Also, CIM’s Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice
Guidelines 45 (2003), in discussing work to determine economic merits of a deposit, states “[t]his work
specifically includes mining engineering evaluations and, most importantly, the preparation of an
appropriate cash flow analysis. These aspects are normal components of both feasibility studies and
preliminary feasibility studies.”

feasibility study. We are concerned that using a pre-feasibility study in such high risk situations
would not sufficiently reduce the uncertainty surrounding the results of the application of
modifying factors to support disclosure of mineral reserves. We note that the SME Guide
reflects a similar concern. 269
Moreover, similar to provisions in the CRIRSCO-based codes, an instruction to the
proposed rules would prohibit a qualified person from using inferred mineral resources in the
pre-feasibility study’s financial analysis. 270
Other proposed instructions are designed to help ensure that the pre-feasibility study is
sufficiently rigorous to support a conclusion that extraction of the reserve is economically viable.
For example, one proposed instruction would explain that the factors to be considered in a prefeasibility study are typically the same as those required for an initial assessment, but considered
at a greater level of detail or at a later stage of development. 271 For example, a pre-feasibility
study would have to define, analyze or otherwise address in detail:
•

the required access roads, infrastructure location and plant area, and the source of all
utilities (e.g., power and water) required for development and production;

269

The SME Guide (2014) pt. 50 states: “The Guide does not require that a Feasibility Study has been
undertaken to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves, but it does require that at least a Prefeasibility Study will have determined that the mining project is technically and economically feasible, and
that relevant Modifying Factors have been considered for such a conversion. However, there may be some
projects for which the Competent Person determines that a Feasibility Study, instead of a Pre-Feasibility
Study, is required before the Mineral Resources may be converted to Mineral Reserves due to uncertainties
in the Modifying Factors.”

270

See Instruction 2 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K.

271

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K. These factors are also set forth in proposed
Table 1, which is referenced in the instructions to proposed Items 1302(c) and (d) of Regulation S-K.

the preferred underground mining method or surface mine pit configuration, with detailed
mine layouts drawn for each alternative;

•

the bench lab tests 272 that have been conducted, the process flow sheet, equipment
sizes, and general arrangement that have been completed, and the plant throughput;

•

the environmental compliance and permitting requirements or interests of agencies, nongovernmental organizations, communities and other stakeholders, the baseline studies,
and the plans for tailings disposal, reclamation and mitigation, together with an analysis
establishing that permitting is possible; and

•

any other reasonable assumptions, based on appropriate testing, on the modifying factors
sufficient to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable. 273
Another proposed instruction would provide that the operating and capital cost estimates

in a pre-feasibility study must have an accuracy level and a contingency range that are
significantly narrower than those permitted to support a determination of mineral resources.
According to this instruction, operating and capital cost estimates in a pre-feasibility study must,
at a minimum, have an accuracy level of approximately ±25% and a contingency range not

272

In the design of industrial process plants, engineers test the design concepts at increasingly larger scales.
An initial step in this process is to conduct laboratory tests using a laboratory simulation of the conceptual
process plant (referred to as bench lab tests). If successful, engineers then conduct tests using a small scale
field plant that can process bulk samples (referred to as pilot or demonstration plant tests). It is only when
these tests are successful that designs for full scale industrial plants are approved and the plants are
constructed. Feasibility studies, depending on the stage, involve bench lab scale or pilot scale tests. See,
e.g., Christopher G. Morris, Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology 244 (1992) which
defines bench-scale testing as “[t]he practice of examining materials, methods, or chemical processes on a
scale that can be performed on a work bench.” See also American Geological Institute, Dictionary of
Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms 406 (2d ed. 1997), which defines a pilot plant as “a small-scale
processing plant in which representative tonnages of ore can be tested under conditions which foreshadow
(or imitate) those of the full-scale operation proposed for a given ore.”

273

See Instruction 3 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K.

115

exceeding 15%. 274 The instruction would require the qualified person to state the accuracy level
and contingency range in the pre-feasibility study.
These latter two instructions (addressing the level at which the modifying factors are
assessed and the appropriate accuracy level and contingency range for operating and capital
costs) are consistent with current industry practice and comparable to requirements for the use of
a pre-feasibility study in the CRIRSCO-based jurisdictions. 275 As such, the proposed
instructions would help ensure that a registrant’s use of a pre-feasibility study in SEC filings
meets the industry established minimum level of detail and rigor sufficient to determine reserves.
Another proposed instruction would address whether and when a registrant would be
required to take additional steps to support its determination of mineral reserves. That
instruction would explain that a determination of “mineral reserves” does not necessarily require
that extraction facilities are in place or operational, that the company has obtained all necessary
permits, or that the company has entered into sales contracts for the sale of mined products. The
instruction would explain, however, that such determination does require that the qualified
person has, after reasonable investigation, not identified any obstacles to obtaining permits and
entering into the necessary sales contracts, and reasonably believes that the chances of obtaining
such approvals and contracts in a timely manner are highly likely. 276 The instruction would also
state that, when assessing mineral reserves, the qualified person must take into account the
potential adverse impacts, if any, from any unresolved material matter on which extraction is
274

See Instruction 6 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K. These accuracy level and contingency
range requirements are also provided in proposed Table 1.

275

276

See Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K.

116

contingent and which is dependent on a third party. Under the proposed instruction, a
determination of mineral reserves does not necessarily mean that extraction facilities have been
built, permits have been obtained or that sales contracts have been entered into. Rather, for a
determination that mineral reserves exist, it is sufficient for the qualified person to conclude,
after reasonable investigation, that there are no obstacles to obtaining permits and revenues from
the mine’s products. This proposed instruction is consistent with similar guidance under the
CRIRSCO-based codes.
Additionally, the proposed instructions would address when the completion of a
preliminary or final market study, as part of a pre-feasibility or feasibility study, may be required
to support a determination of mineral reserves. Specifically, proposed Instruction 1 to Item
1302(d) would explain that the determination of mineral reserves may, in certain circumstances,
require the completion of a preliminary market study (in the context of a pre-feasibility study) or
a final market study (in the context of a final feasibility study) to support the qualified person’s
conclusions about the chances of obtaining revenues from sales. As proposed, a preliminary or
final market study would be required where the mine’s product cannot be traded on an exchange,
there is no other established market for the product, and no sales contract exists. We believe that
this proposed instruction would result in more detailed disclosure, when required under the
circumstances, concerning the basis for the qualified person’s conclusions as to whether the
deposit is a mineral reserve. 277

277

See Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K. Cf. Instruction 4 to proposed Item 1302(d)
of Regulation S-K, which would otherwise permit a pre-feasibility study to be based on a preliminary
market study, and Instruction 9 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K, which permits a feasibility
study to be based on “a final market study or possible letters of intent to purchase.”

117

Finally, another proposed instruction would require a pre-feasibility study to identify
sources of uncertainty that require further refinement in a final feasibility study. 278 This
requirement is intended to elicit appropriate disclosure about the areas of risk present in the prefeasibility study, which should help investors in assessing the reliability of the study.
We believe that the proposed rule and its related proposed instructions, taken as a whole,
would sufficiently mitigate the level of risk resulting from permitting the use of a pre-feasibility
study to support the determination and disclosure of mineral reserves. As such, we believe it
would be appropriate to permit the use of a pre-feasibility study for reserve determination and
disclosure.
ii.

Feasibility Study

As proposed, a feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the
selected development option for a mineral project. 279 Because of the comprehensiveness and
level of detail required for a feasibility study, as provided under the proposed definition of
feasibility study and similar to the comparable definition under the CRIRSCO-based codes, 280
the results of the study may serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial
institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. 281
We are proposing several instructions regarding the use of a feasibility study to support
the determination and disclosure of mineral reserves. One proposed instruction would require a

feasibility study to contain the application and description of all relevant modifying factors in a
more detailed form and with more certainty than a pre-feasibility study. 282 Pursuant to that
instruction, a feasibility study would have to define, analyze or otherwise address in detail:
•

final requirements for site infrastructure, including well-defined access roads, finalized
plans for infrastructure location, plant area, and camp or town site, and the established
source of all required utilities (e.g., power and water) for development and production;

•

a finalized mining method, including detailed mine layouts and final development and
production plan for the preferred alternative with the required equipment fleet specified,
together with detailed mining schedules, construction and production ramp up, and
project execution plans;

•

completed detailed bench lab tests and a pilot plant test, 283 if required, based on risk, in
addition to final requirements for process flow sheet, equipment sizes, general
arrangement and the final plant throughput;

•

the final identification and detailed analysis of environmental compliance and permitting
requirements, including the finalized interests of agencies, NGOs, communities and other
stakeholders, together with the completion of baseline studies and finalized plans for
tailings disposal, reclamation and mitigation; and

•

detailed assessments of other modifying factors necessary to demonstrate that extraction
is economically viable. 284

282

See Instruction 8 to proposed Item 1302(d) of Regulation S-K.

283

See note 272, supra.

284

In addition to Instruction 8 of proposed Item 1302(d), proposed Table 1 also addresses these factors.

119

Another proposed instruction 285 would require a feasibility study to include an economic
analysis that, in addition to describing taxes in detail and assessing economic viability by a
detailed discounted cash flow analysis, also estimates revenues based on at least a final market
study 286 or possible letters of intent to purchase.
A third proposed instruction would require operating and capital cost estimates in a
feasibility study, at a minimum, to have an accuracy level of approximately ±15% and a
contingency range not exceeding 10%. 287 As proposed, the qualified person would have to state
the accuracy level and contingency range in the feasibility study.
These proposed requirements for the use of a feasibility study to support mineral reserve
estimates are intended to promote accurate and uniform disclosure of mineral reserves in SEC
filings, which should benefit investors as well as registrants. As proposed, the requirements
concerning the accuracy level and contingency range for operating and capital cost estimates,
and level of detail or stage of development for the evaluation of modifying factors, are
comparable to those required for the use of a feasibility study to support mineral reserve
estimates under the CRIRSCO-based codes. 288 We believe aligning the U.S. requirements with
international standards would benefit investors and registrants by promoting uniformity in
285

See Instruction 9 to proposed Item 1502(d) of Regulation S-K.

286

As defined in proposed Item 1301(d)(8) of Regulation S-K, a final market study is a comprehensive study
to determine and support the existence of a readily accessible market for the mineral. It must, at a
minimum, include product specifications based on final geologic and metallurgical testing, supply and
demand forecasts, historical prices for the preceding five or more years, estimated long term prices,
evaluation of competitors (including products and estimates of production volumes, sales, and prices),
customer evaluation of product specifications, and market entry strategies or sales contracts. The study
must provide justification for all assumptions, which must include all material contracts required to develop
and sell the reserves.

mining disclosure standards. In addition, the proposed instructions are generally consistent with
staff guidance for the use of a feasibility study to support a determination and disclosure of
mineral reserves. Accordingly, we do not believe that adoption of the proposed definition of
feasibility study and the corresponding proposed instructions would significantly change existing
disclosure practices of registrants.
Request for Comment
84. Should we define “preliminary feasibility study” and “feasibility study,” as proposed?
Are there any terms and conditions that we should include instead of or in addition to
those included in the proposed definitions? Are there any terms or conditions under
each definition that we should exclude?
85. Should we permit the use of either a pre-feasibility study or a feasibility study to
support the determination and disclosure of mineral reserves, as proposed? Why or why
not?
86. Should we require qualified persons to use a feasibility study in situations where the
risk is high, as proposed? Why or why not? Are there other conditions, in addition to
or in lieu of high risk situations, where we should require a feasibility study in support
of mineral reserve disclosure?
87. Should we adopt the proposed instructions about the use of a pre-feasibility study to
support the determination and disclosure of mineral reserves? Are there any instructions
that we should provide instead of or in addition to the proposed instructions for such use
of a pre-feasibility study? Are there any instructions that we should exclude? Would the
proposed instructions mitigate the risk of less certain disclosure that could result from the

Specific Disclosure Requirements

Item 102 refers issuers “engaged in significant mining operations” to Guide 7. Guide 7
in turn calls for the disclosure of certain items for each “mine, plant or other significant
property” in which the registrant has an economic interest. 289 As written, the current rules and
guidance presume that if a registrant’s mining operations are “significant,” investors need and
registrants should provide disclosure on every property. Neither Item 102 nor Guide 7
contemplates the situation where a registrant has significant mining operations with multiple
mining properties, some or all of which may not be individually significant. As such, neither
addresses the disclosure required in that situation. In practice, however, there are registrants that
have a large number of properties, such that providing disclosure on all properties may not be
practicable or provide any meaningful benefit to investors. In such circumstances, on a case by
case basis as part of the filing review process, and when appropriate under the specific facts and
circumstances, the staff has not objected if a registrant with multiple mining properties provides
289

See paragraph (b) of Guide 7.

122

summary disclosure that encompasses all of its properties instead of on a property by property
basis. There is, however, no Commission rule that registrants can use to determine when
summary disclosure would be appropriate. In addition, this informal approach can lead to
inconsistent disclosure as Guide 7 does not address whether and to what extent its disclosure
items for each individual property also apply for summary disclosure purposes.
1.

Requirements for Summary Disclosure

We believe that, for registrants with economic interests in multiple mining properties,
investors would benefit from an overview of the mining operations in addition to a property by
property description. We believe that this would also result in more efficient and more effective
disclosure, as registrants would be able to provide summary disclosure about all properties where
some or all are not individually material. As such, we are proposing that registrants that own
two or more mining properties must provide summary disclosure of their mining operations. 290
The summary disclosure would include a map or maps showing the locations of all
mining properties. 291 We believe the proposed requirement for a map showing the location of all
mining properties would provide investors a point of reference to assess the geographic and
socio-political risks associated with the registrant’s mining operations. 292
290

See proposed Item 1303(a) of Regulation S-K. The registrant would be required to provide the summary
disclosure for all properties that the registrant owns or in which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a
direct or indirect economic interest. It also would have to provide summary disclosure for properties that it
operates, or it is probable that it will operate, under a lease or other legal agreement that grants the
registrant ownership or similar rights that authorize it, as principal, to sell or otherwise dispose of the
mineral. Further, a registrant would have to provide summary disclosure for properties for which it has, or
it is probable that it will have, an associated royalty or similar right.

291

See proposed Item 1303(b)(1) of Regulation S-K.

292

Item 102 requires registrants to provide “appropriate maps” disclosing “the location” of significant
properties, but does not address whether or when registrants with multiple properties, none of which are
material, should provide a map (or maps) showing the location of all its mining properties. We believe that
the proposed requirement, which is consistent with current staff guidance, would provide investors with

123

The proposed summary disclosure would also include a presentation, in tabular form, of
certain specified information about the 20 properties with the largest asset values (or fewer, if the
registrant has an economic interest in fewer than 20 mining properties), 293 and a summary, in
tabular form, of all mineral resources and reserves at the end of the most recently completed
fiscal year. 294 We believe that the proposed requirement to disclose property-specific
information for a registrant’s 20 largest properties based on asset value would provide investors
with an appropriately comprehensive and thorough understanding of a registrant’s mining
operations. In this regard, we think it is likely that, for registrants having a relatively small
number of properties (e.g., 20-30), the proposed requirement would capture all or most of their
mining properties. For those registrants with a higher number of properties, we believe the 20
largest properties based on asset value are likely to capture most of their material properties and
as such provide an appropriately comprehensive overview of the registrants’ mining operations.
As proposed, for each of the properties required to be included in the summary
disclosure, a registrant would have to identify the property, report the total production from the
property for the three most recently completed fiscal years, 295 and disclose the following
information:
•

the location of the property;

•

the type and amount of ownership interest;
beneficial information but not significantly impact current disclosure practices.

293

See proposed Item 1303(b)(2) of Regulation S-K.

294

See proposed Item 1303(b)(3) of Regulation S-K.

295

As proposed, a registrant with only a royalty interest would have to provide only the portion of the
production that led to royalty income for each of the three most recently completed fiscal years. See
proposed Instruction 2 to proposed Item 1303(b)(2) of Regulation S-K.

124

•

the identity of the operator;

•

title, mineral rights, leases or options and acreage involved;

•

the stage of the property (exploration, development or production);

•

key permit conditions;

•

mine type and mineralization style; and

•

processing plant and other available facilities.
For the purpose of determining the registrant’s 20 largest properties, a registrant would be

permitted to treat multiple mines with interrelated mining operations 296 as one mining
property. 297 For example, multiple mines that share the same processing plant or other facilities,
prior to the first point of material external sale, could be considered a single property. 298
Guide 7 currently calls for the disclosure of all of the above items of information. We
continue to believe that these items are important to the description of, and necessary to an
understanding of, a mining property. The summary information required about each of the 20
largest properties, by asset value, however, would be less than what we are proposing to require
for individual material properties. For example, we are not proposing to require summary
information on the exploration work carried out and material exploration results in the reporting
period. 299 Nevertheless, we believe that, for these 20 properties, the proposed disclosure is

296

See the definition of mining operations in Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1301(b) of Regulation S-K.

297

See Instruction 1 to proposed Item 1303(b)(2) of Regulation S-K.

298

Registrants could take a similar approach when determining what is “a property” for the purposes of
determining an “individual property” under proposed Item 1304 of Regulation S-K, as discussed in section
II.G.2, infra.

299

See section II.G.2, infra, for a discussion of the required disclosure for individual material properties.

125

sufficient to present a reasonably comprehensive summary of the registrant’s mining operations.
In order to standardize the disclosure, facilitate a registrant’s compliance with the disclosure
requirements, and enhance an investor’s understanding of this information, we are proposing that
a registrant must provide this information in tabular form using the format of the following table,
designated as Table 2: 300

In addition, under the proposed rules, a registrant would have to provide a summary of
its mineral resources and mineral reserves at the end of its most recently completed fiscal year,
by commodity and geographic area, and for each property containing 10% or more of the
registrant's mineral reserves or 10% or more of the registrant’s combined measured and indicated
mineral resources. The registrant would have to provide this summary for each class of mineral
300

See proposed Table 2, which follows Instruction 2 to proposed Item 1303(b)(2) of Regulation S-K.

126

reserves (probable and proven) and resources (inferred, indicated and measured), together with
total mineral reserves and total measured and indicated mineral resources. 301 As proposed, all
mineral reserves and resources reported in the summary table must be based on, and accurately
reflect, information and supporting documentation prepared by a qualified person.
We believe that this proposed requirement would provide investors with information
necessary to understand a registrant’s material mining operations at fiscal year’s end. 302 Such
information would, for example, enable investors to understand and evaluate the registrant’s
ability to replenish depleting mineral reserves, a well-established measure of financial
performance in mining. 303 The breakdown of the mineral resources and reserves by category and
source (geographic area and property) also would provide investors with a measure of the
associated risk. In order to standardize the disclosure, facilitate a registrant’s compliance with
the disclosure requirements, and enhance an investor’s understanding of this information, we are
proposing that a registrant must provide this information in tabular form using the format of the
following table, designated as Table 3: 304

301

See proposed Item 1303(b)(3) of Regulation S-K.

302

See, e.g., SME Petition for Rulemaking at 1 (“Mining companies and investors around the world consider

Acquisition Strategies to Obtain Ore Reserves 281-282 (1987). ("Mining company objectives are ... profit,

reserves. An underlying thread among the profit, growth, and survival objectives is ore reserve
replacement and growth.") See also H. R. Bullis, Gold Deposits, Exploration Realities, and the
Unsustainability of Very Large Gold Producers 313-320 (2003).

Unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, the registrant must use a commodity price that is no higher
than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of the last fiscal year, determined as an
unweighted arithmetic average of the daily closing price for each trading day within such period and must disclose
the price used. When prices are defined by contractual agreements, the registrant may use the price set by the
contractual arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable, and the registrant discloses that it is using a
contractual price and discloses the contractual price used.

We also are proposing several instructions to this summary disclosure requirement. The
proposed instructions would:
•

define the term “by geographic area” to mean by individual country, regions of a
country, state, groups of states, mining district, or other political units, to the extent

128

material to and necessary for an investor’s understanding of a registrant’s mining
operations; 305
•

explain that all disclosure of mineral resources must be exclusive of mineral
reserves; 306

•

require that all disclosure of mineral resources and reserves must be only for the portion
of the resources or reserves attributable to the registrant’s interest in the property; 307

•

require all mineral resource and reserve estimates to be based on prices that are no
higher than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of the
fiscal year covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the
daily closing price for each trading day within such period, unless prices are defined by
contractual arrangements; 308 and

•

require that the mineral resource and reserve estimates called for in proposed Table 3
must be in terms of saleable product. 309
We believe that these instructions would facilitate the clear and consistent presentation of

information concerning a registrant’s mineral reserves and resources for investors while
providing flexibility to the registrant regarding the basis of the information presented. For
example, the requirement to use any price below the 24-month trailing average provides

registrants some flexibility on the price used in its reserve estimation. Also, the definition of “by
geographic area” provides registrants flexibility on how to organize the information requested in
Table 2.
For registrants with mining operations that are, in the aggregate, material but for which
no individual property is material, this summary disclosure under proposed Item 1303 would be
the only mining disclosure required in the registrant’s filings. For registrants with individual
properties that are material, we are proposing additional, more detailed, disclosure about such
properties. 310 In addition, the proposed rules would exclude registrants with only one mining
property from the summary disclosure requirement 311 because we do not see any benefit to
requiring summary disclosure, in addition to individual disclosure, for a single material property.
We believe the proposed requirement for summary disclosure would be beneficial for
both registrants and investors. We believe it would provide more efficient and effective
disclosure and would better accommodate the diversity among registrants in terms of the number
and relative size of their mining properties. Registrants would be required to disclose an
appropriate level of information based on their particular facts and circumstances, specifically
taking into account whether they own individually material properties. Under this approach,
investors would be provided with information necessary to understand the registrant’s mining
operations even if it owns no individually material property. For those registrants with
individually material properties, investors would obtain aggregate information about the
registrant’s mining operations as well as more detailed information about individually material

Request for Comment
90. Should we require summary disclosure, as proposed, for all registrants with material
mining operations? Why or why not? Should such summary disclosure require maps
showing the locations of all mining properties, a presentation of the proposed
information about the 20 properties with the largest asset values, and a summary of all
mineral resources and reserves at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, as
proposed?
91. Should we permit registrants to treat multiple mines with interrelated mining operations
as one mining property, as proposed? Should we instead require registrants to treat
such mines as separate properties? Why or why not?
92. Should we exclude registrants with only one mining property from the summary
disclosure requirements, as proposed? Why or why not? Alternatively, should we use a
different threshold than the proposed “only one” threshold for excluding a registrant
from the summary disclosure requirements? If so, what threshold should we use and
why would this threshold be more appropriate?
93. Regarding the proposed summary disclosure requirement for the 20 largest properties,
should we require other information, in addition to or in lieu of the proposed items?
Why or why not? For example, should we require the registrant to disclose the asset
value of each property included in its summary disclosure? Should we revise the
proposed form and content of Table 2? If so, how should we revise the table’s form or
content?

131

94. Should the presentation of information about the mining properties with the largest asset
values include the 20 largest properties, as proposed? Should this number be higher or
lower? If so, what number is appropriate? Why? Should the summary disclosure
include only those properties that represent 5% or more in asset value? Should we
permit the summary disclosure to omit any property that represents 1% or less in asset
value? Alternatively, should we require the specified information based on some
criteria (e.g. revenues) other than asset value?
95. Should we require summary disclosure to include information on mineral resources and
reserves, as proposed? Why or why not? If mineral resources and reserves are required
in summary disclosure, should we require their disclosure by class of mineral reserves
(probable and proven) and resources (inferred, indicated and measured), together with
total mineral reserves and total measured and indicated mineral resources, as proposed?
Should we require the summary disclosure by commodity and geographic area or
property containing 10% or more of mineral reserves or sum of measured and indicated
mineral resources, as proposed? Why or why not? In particular, is the proposed
instruction to Table 3 regarding the scope of geographic area to be disclosed sufficiently
clear, and if not, how should it be clarified? Should we require disclosure of mineral
reserves and resources by some other attribute (e.g., segments), in addition to or in lieu
of commodity and geographic area? If so, which attributes should we use and why?
Should we revise the proposed form and content of Table 3? If so, how should we
revise the table’s form or content?
96. Should we require the disclosure in Tables 2 and 3 to be made available in the
eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format? Why or why not?
132

97.

If we require the disclosure in Tables 2 and 3 to be made available in XBRL, are the
current requirements for the format and elements of the tables suitable for tagging? If
not, how should they be revised? In particular, are the proposed instructions for Tables
2 and 3 sufficiently specific to make the data reported in the tables suitable for direct
comparative analysis? If not, how should the instructions be revised to increase the
usefulness of having the data made available in XBRL, including the comparability and
quality of XBRL data?

98.

If we require Tables 2 and 3 to be made available in XBRL, is there a particular
existing taxonomy that should be used? Alternatively, what features should a suitable
taxonomy have in this case?
2.

Requirements for Individual Property Disclosure

We believe that summary property disclosure alone would not provide all relevant
information about the properties and assets that generate a mining registrant’s revenues.
Therefore, we are proposing that a registrant provide more detailed information for each of its
individual properties that is material to its business or financial condition. When determining
whether an individual property is material to its business or financial condition, a registrant
would have to apply the same standards and consider the same factors as required when
determining whether its mining operations as a whole are material. 312

312

See proposed Item 1304(a) of Regulation S-K, which references proposed Item 1301(b). A registrant
would have to apply those standards and other considerations to each individual property that it owns or in
which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a direct or indirect economic interest; that it operates, or it is
probable that it will operate, under a lease or other legal agreement that grants the registrant ownership or
similar rights that authorize it, as principal, to sell or otherwise dispose of the mineral; or that it has, or it is
probable that it will have, an associated royalty or similar right.

133

As proposed, for each material individual property, a registrant would have to provide a
brief description of the property, 313 including:
•

the property’s location, accurate to within one mile, using an easily recognizable
coordinate system, including appropriate maps, with proper engineering detail (such as
scale, orientation, and titles), which must be legible on the page when printed; 314

•

existing infrastructure, including roads, railroads, airports, towns, ports, sources of water,
electricity, and personnel; 315 and

•

a brief description, including the name or number and size (acreage), of the titles, claims,
concessions, mineral rights, leases or options under which the registrant and its
subsidiaries have or will have the right to hold or operate the property, and how such
rights are obtained at this location, indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet
in order to obtain or retain the property. If held by leases or options or if the mineral
rights otherwise have termination provisions, the registrant would have to provide the
expiration dates of such leases, options or mineral rights and associated payments. 316

313

See proposed Item 1304(b)(1).

314

See proposed Item 1304(b)(1)(i). We believe the level of accuracy that would be required by the proposed
rule is similar to the level of detail required by the CRIRSCO-based codes. See, e.g., PERC Table 1
requirement on key plan, maps and diagrams, which calls for a location or index map and more detailed
maps showing all important features described in the text, including all relevant cadastral and other
infrastructure features...All maps, plans and sections noted in this checklist, should be legible, and include a
legend, coordinates, coordinate system, scale bar and north arrow.” Similarly, SAMREC Table 1 also calls
for a “detailed topo-cadastral map.”

315

See proposed Item 1304(b)(1)(ii).

316

See proposed Item 1304(b)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-K.

134

For each material property, the proposed rules also would require a registrant to disclose
a history of previous operations, 317 a description of the condition and status of the property, 318
and a description of any significant encumbrances to the property, including current and future
permitting requirements and associated deadlines, permit conditions, regulatory violations and
associated fines. 319
In addition to providing a brief description of the present condition of the property, a
registrant would have to disclose the work completed by the registrant on the property; the
registrant’s proposed program of exploration or development; the current stage of the property as
exploration, development or production; the current state of exploration or development of the
property; and the current production activities. Mines would have to be identified as either
surface or underground, with a brief description of the mining method and processing operations.
If the property is without known reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature or
the registrant has started extraction without determining mineral reserves, the registrant would
have to provide a statement to that effect. 320
The proposed rules would also require a registrant to disclose, for each material property,
the age, details as to modernization and physical condition of the equipment, facilities,
infrastructure, and underground development. 321 In addition, the registrant would have to

See proposed Item 1304(b)(2) of Regulation S-K.

See proposed Item 1304(b)(3) of Regulation S-K.

319

See proposed Item 1304(b)(4) of Regulation S-K.

320

See proposed Item 1304(b)(3)(i) of Regulation S-K.

321

See proposed Item 1304(b)(3)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

135

disclose the total cost for or book value of the property and its associated plant and equipment. 322
Regarding significant encumbrances to the property, a registrant would have to describe current
and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations
and fines. 323
The above proposed items of disclosure are substantially similar to items called for by
Item 102 of Regulation S-K and Guide 7. 324 We continue to believe that these items are
necessary to enable an investor to have an informed understanding of a registrant’s material
mining properties. In particular, property location is frequently used to assess socio-political and
geographic risk, level of infrastructure, significance of adjacent properties and regional geology.
In light of this, we believe that the required level of accuracy in the proposed rules is necessary.
For example, the distance between a property and other (developing or producing) properties or
in relation to major geologic structures can significantly impact the assessment of a property’s
value, especially in the exploration stage. 325
322

See proposed Item 1304(b)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-K. An instruction to this Item would reiterate that a
registrant must identify an individual property with no mineral reserves as an exploration stage property,
even if it has other properties in development or production; and a registrant that does not have reserves on
any of its properties cannot characterize itself as a development or production stage company, even if it has
mineral resources or exploration results, or even if it is engaged in extraction without first disclosing
mineral reserves.

323

See proposed Item 1304(b)(4) of Regulation S-K.

324

For example, paragraph (b) of Guide 7 calls for registrants to disclose the location and means of access to
the property, a description of the title, claim, lease or option under which the registrant operates the
property with appropriate maps to portray the location, a history of previous operations, a description of the
present condition of the property, the work completed by the registrant on the property, the registrant’s
proposed program of exploration and development, the current state of exploration or development of the
property, and a description of the rock formations and mineralization of existing or potential economic
significance on the property, including the identity of the principal metallic or other constituents insofar as
known.

325

Location of a mineral prospect relative to known deposits or geologic structures is an attribute used to
determine the mineral potential (i.e., the probability that mineral deposits of the type sought can be found at
the prospect). See, e.g., E. J. M. Carranza, “Geocomputation of mineral exploration targets,” Computers &

136

To increase the quality and usefulness of the disclosure provided pursuant to the existing
mining disclosure regime, the proposed rules would include several additional items of
individual property disclosure. For example, unlike Guide 7, which does not address the issue,
the proposed rules would apply to the disclosure obligations of a registrant holding a royalty
interest or other similar economic interest in a property. Under the proposed rules, such a
registrant would be required to describe all of the above information that an owner or operator of
the property would have to provide, including, for example, the documents under which the
owner or operator holds or operates the property, the mineral rights held by the owner or
operator, conditions required to be met by the owner or operator, and the expiration dates of
leases, options and mineral rights. The registrant would also have to describe briefly the
agreement under which the registrant and its subsidiaries have or will have the right to a royalty
or similar interest in the property, indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet in order
to obtain or retain the royalty or similar interest, and indicating the expiration date. 326 We
believe this information would help investors understand a royalty holder’s property interest. We
also believe that including individual property disclosure requirements in the rules for holders of
royalty and other economic interests would help to elicit more complete and consistent
disclosure in this regard to the benefit of those holders and their investors.
In addition, we are proposing to require several of the disclosure items in tabular form
because we believe this would standardize the disclosure, facilitate a registrant’s compliance

with the disclosure requirements, and enhance an investor’s understanding of the registrant’s
material mining properties. 327 Specifically, we are proposing that a registrant, for each material
property, would provide the tabular information required by Tables 4, 5, and 6 as set forth below.
While we are proposing general guidelines for the tabular presentations, we would permit
registrants to modify the tables for ease of presentation, to add information, or to combine two or
more required tables throughout their disclosure. 328
As proposed, Table 4 would require a summary of the exploration activity for the most
recently completed fiscal year, which, for each sampling method used, discloses the number of
samples, the total size or length of the samples, and the total number of assays. 329 A registrant
would have to provide this information in tabular form using the format of the following table,
designated as Table 4:

FISCAL YEAR ENDING [DATE]

This refers to number of drill holes, trenches, geophysical survey lines, etc.

This refers to the total length of drill holes, trenches, and geophysical survey lines or total amount of material in
bulk sampling.

As proposed, Table 5 would require a registrant to provide a summary of material
exploration results for the most recently completed fiscal year, which, for each material property,
identifies the hole that generated the exploration results, and describes the length, lithology 330

329

See proposed Table 4 and proposed Item 1304(b)(5) of Regulation S-K.

330

Lithology, as used in this context, refers to the description of a particular rock unit. Generally, it refers to

138

and key geologic properties (e.g., grades, contaminants, and energy content) of the exploration
results. A registrant would have to provide this information in tabular form using the format of
the following table, designated as Table 5, accompanied by a brief discussion of the exploration
results’ context and relevance: 331

If only results from selected holes and intersections are included, they should be accompanied by a discussion of
the context and justification for excluding other results.

Neither Guide 7 nor Item 102 calls for disclosure of exploration results, although Guide 7
does call for the disclosure of the registrant’s exploration program. 332 As discussed above, we
are proposing to require disclosure of a registrant’s material exploration results because we
believe such disclosure would provide investors with a more comprehensive view of a
registrant’s mining operations and help them make more informed investment decisions. 333
Table 6, as proposed, would require a registrant to disclose, if mineral resources or
reserves have been determined, a summary of all mineral resources and reserves, which, for each
material property, provides the estimated tonnages, grades (or quality, where appropriate), cutthe characteristics of a rock formation.

off grades and metallurgical recovery, by class of mineral resource and reserve, occurring in-situ,
as plant/mill feed, and as saleable product. 334 A registrant would have to provide this
information in tabular form using the format of the following table, designated as Table 6:

Unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, the registrant must use a commodity price that is no higher
than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of the last fiscal year, determined as an
unweighted arithmetic average of the daily closing price for each trading day within such period and must disclose
the price used. When prices are defined by contractual agreements, the registrant may use the price set by the
contractual arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable, and the registrant discloses that it is using a
contractual price and discloses the contractual price used.

We also are proposing a few instructions to the provisions requiring a registrant to
disclose its exploration activity, material exploration results, and mineral resource and reserve
estimates for each material property. One instruction would advise a registrant not to include an
extensive description of regional geology, but, rather, to include geological information that is
brief and relevant to property disclosure. 335 Another proposed instruction would explain that all
disclosure of mineral resources must be exclusive of mineral reserves. 336 A third proposed

334

See Instruction 1 to proposed Items 1304(b)(5) through (7).

336

140

instruction would state that a registrant with only a royalty interest should provide only the
portion of the resources or reserves that are subject to the royalty or similar agreement. 337 We
believe that these proposed instructions would facilitate a registrant’s compliance with the
individual property disclosure requirements while providing investors with focused and
consistent disclosure.
The proposed rules would further require a registrant to provide, in proposed Tables 7
and 8, a comparison of its mineral resources and reserves as of the end of the last fiscal year
against the mineral resources and reserves as of the end of the preceding fiscal year, with an
explanation of any change between the two. 338 The comparison would have to disclose
information concerning:
•

the mineral resources or reserves at the end of the last two fiscal years;

•

the net difference between the mineral resources or reserves at the end of the last
completed fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year, as a percentage of the resources or
reserves at the end of the fiscal year preceding the last completed one;

•

an explanation of the causes of any discrepancy in mineral resources including depletion
or production, changes in commodity prices, additional resources discovered through
exploration, and changes due to the methods employed; and

•

an explanation of the causes of any discrepancy in mineral reserves including depletion
or production, changes in the resource model, changes in commodity prices and operating

A registrant would have to provide this comparison in tabular form in the following format:

We believe that this comparative disclosure requirement would help investors understand the
reasons for the year to year changes in a registrant’s mineral resources and reserves, which
should help investors analyze and evaluate a registrant’s future prospects.
While Guide 7 calls for annual disclosure of mineral reserves, it does not call for
registrants to compare their current mineral reserve disclosure with previously provided
disclosure. Thus, this proposed comparative disclosure requirement could increase reporting
costs for registrants. We believe, however, that much of the disclosure that would be required
under the proposed comparative disclosure requirement is often provided by registrants pursuant
to current disclosure practices. We believe that in most cases this disclosure is sufficiently
important to an investor's understanding of the registrant's material properties that it would be
appropriate to have a separate, stand-alone requirement set forth in our rules.
If the registrant has not previously disclosed mineral reserve or resource estimates in a
filing with the Commission or is disclosing material changes to its previously disclosed mineral
reserve or resource estimates, we are proposing that it provide a brief discussion of the material
assumptions and criteria in the disclosure. The material assumptions and criteria would depend
on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the particular property and the mineral
resource and reserve estimates. The disclosure of these assumptions and criteria, however,
would need to include all of the material information necessary for investors to understand the
disclosed mineral resources or reserves. In addition, the registrant would have to cite to
corresponding sections of the technical report summary, which would be filed as an exhibit
pursuant to proposed Item 1302(b). 340

340

See proposed Item 1304(b)(9) of Regulation S-K.

143

Similarly, if the registrant has not previously disclosed material exploration results in a
filing with the Commission, or is disclosing material changes to its previously disclosed
exploration results, we are proposing that it must provide sufficient information to allow for an
accurate understanding of the significance of the exploration results. This must include
information such as exploration context, type and method of sampling, sampling intervals and
methods, relevant sample locations, distribution, dimensions, and relative location of all relevant
assay and physical data, data aggregation methods, land tenure status, and any additional
material information that may be necessary to make the required disclosure concerning the
registrant’s exploration results not misleading. In addition, the registrant would have to cite to
corresponding sections of the summary technical report, which would be filed as an exhibit
pursuant to proposed Item 1302(b). 341
Finally, we are proposing some individual property disclosure instructions applicable to
registrants that have not previously disclosed mineral resource or reserve estimates or material
exploration results or that are disclosing a material change in previously disclosed mineral
resource or reserve estimates or material exploration results. Most of these proposed instructions
are designed to assist registrants in determining whether there has been a material change in
estimates of mineral resources, mineral reserves, or material exploration results. For example,
one key proposed instruction would explain that whether a change in exploration results, mineral
resources, or mineral reserves, is material must be based on all facts and circumstances, both
quantitative and qualitative. 342 Another proposed instruction would provide that a change in

341

See proposed Item 1304(b)(10) of Regulation S-K.

342

See Instruction 1 to proposed Items 1304(b)(9) and (10).

144

exploration results that significantly alters the potential of the exploration target is considered
material. 343
Other proposed instructions would establish quantitative thresholds for presumed
materiality of a change in estimates of mineral resources or reserves. For example, one proposed
instruction would state that an annual change in total resources or reserves of 10% or more,
excluding production as reported in proposed Tables 7 and 8, is presumed to be material, and
thus would need to be disclosed. 344 Another proposed instruction would establish that a
cumulative change in total resources or reserves of 30% or more in absolute terms, excluding
production as reported in Tables 7 and 8, from the current filed technical report summary is
presumed to be material. 345 A third proposed instruction would require that, when applying
these quantitative thresholds for presumed materiality, the registrant should consider the change
in total resources or reserves on the basis of total tonnage or volume of saleable product. 346
Another proposed instruction would require a registrant to consider carefully whether the
filed technical report summary is current with respect to all material assumptions and
information, including assumptions relating to or underlying all modifying factors and scientific
and technical information (e.g., sampling data, estimation assumptions and methods). To the
extent that the registrant is not filing a technical report summary but instead is basing the
required disclosure upon a previously filed report, that report would also have to be current in

343

See Instruction 2 to proposed Items 1304(b)(9) and (10).

344

See Instruction 3 to proposed Items 1304(b)(9) and (10).

345

See Instruction 4 to proposed Items 1304(b)(9) and (10).

346

See Instruction 5 to proposed Items 1304(b)(9) and (10).

145

these respects. If the previously filed report is not current in these respects, the registrant would
have to file a revised or new summary technical report from a qualified person, in compliance
with Item 601(b)(96) of Regulation S-K, which supports the registrant’s mining property
disclosures. 347
Finally, a proposed instruction would explain that a report containing estimates of the
quantity, grade, or metal or mineral content of a deposit or exploration results that a registrant
has not verified as a current mineral resource, mineral reserve, or exploration results, and which
was prepared before the registrant acquired, or entered into an agreement to acquire, an interest
in the property that contains the deposit, would not be considered current and could not be filed
in support of disclosure. 348
We believe these instructions would help a registrant determine when it must file a
technical report summary as an exhibit to the filing and provide the appropriate accompanying
disclosure in the filing about the resource or reserve estimates and material exploration results.
At the same time, the proposed instructions would help to ensure that investors are provided with
current information about their mineral resources and reserves and material exploration results.
Request for Comment
99. Should we require disclosure on individually material properties, as proposed? Why or
why not? Should such disclosure require a description of the property, a history of
previous operations, a description of the condition and status of the property, a
description of any significant encumbrances to the property, a summary of the
exploration activity for the most recently completed fiscal year, a summary of material

146

exploration results for the most recently completed fiscal year, and a summary of all
mineral resources and reserves, if mineral resources or reserves have been determined,
as proposed?
100.

Should we require that a registrant provide the property’s location, including in

maps, accurate within one mile? Why or why not? If not, should we use a standard for
degree of accuracy similar to that used in the CRIRSCO-based codes, such as PERC or
SAMREC? Why or why not? If not, what level of accuracy should we require?
101. Should we require that a registrant provide in tabular format each of the summaries
required for its exploration activity, material explorations results, and mineral resources
and reserves, as proposed? Why or why not? Should we require all of the information
specified in Tables 4-8 to be in tabular form? Why or why not? Should we revise the
proposed form and content of these tables? If so, how should we revise the tables’ form
or content?
102. Should we permit registrants to disclose estimates of mineral resources and reserves
based on different price criteria, which may reasonably be achieved, in lieu of, or in
addition to, the price which is no higher than the 24-month trailing average? Why or
why not? What factors should we use to determine what may reasonably be achieved?
Should we require all registrants to use the 24-month average spot price (or average
over a different period) as the commodity price instead of as a ceiling? Why or why
not?
103. Should we require the registrant to provide a comparison of the mineral resources and
reserves as of the end of the last fiscal year against the mineral resources and reserves as
of the end of the preceding fiscal year, with an explanation of any material change
147

between the two, as proposed? Why or why not? Are there items of information that we
should include in the comparison instead of or in addition to the proposed items of
information? Are there any proposed items of information that we should exclude from
the comparison?
104. If the registrant has not previously disclosed material exploration results, mineral
reserve or resource estimates in a filing with the Commission or is disclosing material
changes to its previously disclosed exploration results, mineral reserve or mineral
resource estimates, should we require it to provide a brief discussion of the material
assumptions and criteria in the disclosure and cite to any sections of the technical report
summary, as proposed? Should we require registrants to file updated summary
technical reports to support disclosure of material exploration results, mineral resources
or mineral reserves when the registrant is relying on a previously filed technical report
summary that is no longer current with respect to all material scientific and technical
information, as proposed? Why or why not?
105. Regarding the proposed requirement to disclose a material change in mineral resources
or reserves, should we adopt an instruction that an annual change in total resources or
reserves of 10% or more, or a cumulative change in total resources or reserves of 30%
or more in absolute terms, excluding production as reported in Tables 7 and 8, is
presumed to be material, as proposed? Why or why not? If not, should we remove the
materiality presumptions altogether or use different quantitative thresholds from those
proposed? If the latter, what alternative thresholds or measure(s) should replace the
proposed presumptions of materiality?

148

106. Should we require the disclosure in Tables 4 through 8 to be made available in the
XBRL format? Why or why not?
107. If we require the disclosure in Tables 4 through 8 to be made available in XBRL, are the
current requirements regarding for the format and elements of the tables suitable for
tagging? If not, how should they be revised? In particular, are the proposed
instructions for Tables 4 through 8 sufficiently specific to make the data reported in the
tables suitable for direct comparative analysis? If not, how should the instructions be
revised to increase the usefulness of having the data made available in XBRL, including
the comparability and quality of XBRL data?
108. If we require Tables 4 through 8 to be made available in XBRL, is there a particular
existing taxonomy that should be used? Alternatively, what features should a suitable
taxonomy have in this case?

Requirements for Technical Report Summaries

As previously discussed, the proposed rules would require a registrant to file, as an
exhibit, a technical report summary to support the disclosure of mineral resources, mineral
reserves, or material exploration results for each material property. We believe that requiring
disclosure of the important scientific and technical information that forms the basis for disclosure
of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves in SEC filings would benefit
investors. In this regard, a registrant’s estimates of its mineral reserves, resources and
exploration results are entirely dependent on the scientific and technical information considered
by the qualified person. There is always a level of uncertainty associated with estimates of
mineral deposits under the ground. As such, the report would provide investors with important
contextual information with which to evaluate the reliability of the registrant’s disclosure.
149

The proposed rules would require a qualified person to identify and summarize the
scientific and technical information and conclusions reached concerning material mineral
exploration results, initial assessments used to support disclosure of mineral resources, and
preliminary or final feasibility studies used to support disclosure of mineral reserves, for each
material property, in the technical report summary. 349 The qualified person would also have to
sign and date the technical report summary. 350 This requirement should help to ensure the
reliability of the technical report summary.
The proposed requirements for the contents of the technical report summary are intended
to elicit the scientific and technical information necessary to support the determination and
disclosure of mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration results. These
proposed requirements, as discussed below, are similar in most respects to the items of
information required for the summary report under the Canadian mining disclosure provisions in
NI 43-101. 351 They are also similar to the contents suggested in the mining engineering
literature. 352 These similarities support our view that the proposed sections of the technical
report summary would provide relevant and useful information to facilitate an investor’s
understanding of a registrant’s mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration
results.

A Survey of Important Issues (Philip Maxwell and Pietro Guj, eds, 2006).

150

As proposed, the technical report summary must not include large amounts of technical
or other project data, either in the report or as appendices to the report. 353 This requirement
would prohibit the current practice, by some registrants, of providing large amounts of drill hole
data 354 and other technical information as appendices to technical report summaries. In addition,
the qualified person must draft the summary to conform, to the extent practicable, with plain
English principles under the Securities Act and Exchange Act. 355 These proposed requirements
should help improve the readability of the technical report summary for the benefit of those
investors who do not have a technical engineering background. They also are consistent with
similar Canadian mining disclosure standards. 356
We are proposing that the technical report summary consist of some or all of the
following 26 sections, 357 depending upon the specific scope of the summary:
•

an executive summary that briefly summarizes the most significant information in the
technical report summary, including property description and ownership, geology and
mineralization, the status of exploration, development and operations, mineral resource

353

See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iii) of Regulation S-K.

Drill hole data, as used in this context, refers to information obtained from drilling that includes results of
laboratory analysis of samples obtained from drilling and rock types.

356

See Instruction 3 to Form 43-101F1, which states: “The qualified person preparing the technical report
should keep in mind that the intended audience is the investing public and their advisors who, in most
cases, will not be mining experts. Therefore, to the extent possible, technical reports should be simplified
and understandable to a reasonable investor. However, the technical report should include sufficient
context and cautionary language to allow a reasonable investor to understand the nature, importance, and
limitations of the data, interpretations, and conclusions summarized in the technical report.”

357

See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B), which is set forth in its entirety in section VIII, infra, for a complete
list and description of the contents of the technical report summary The description of these sections that
follows is not intended to be comprehensive.

requirements, and the qualified person’s conclusions and recommendations; 358
•

an introduction, which, among other matters, must identify the registrant for whom the
technical report summary was prepared, disclose the terms of reference and purpose for
which the technical report summary was prepared, and briefly describe any personal
inspection of the property by each qualified person 359 or, if none was made, the reason
why a personal inspection was not completed; 360

a description of the property’s accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructure and
physiography; 362

358

See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(1) of Regulation S-K.

As indicated in note 74, supra, a registrant may have more than one qualified person prepare a technical
report summary for a mining property or project.

360

See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(2) of Regulation S-K.

361

The property description must include the area of the property, the name or number of each title, claim,
mineral right, lease or option under which the registrant and its subsidiaries have or will have the right to
hold or operate the property, the mineral rights, and how such rights have been obtained at this location,
indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet in order to obtain or retain the property, any
significant encumbrances to the property, including current and future permitting requirements and
associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines, and any other significant factors and risks
that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform work on the property. See proposed Item
601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(3) of Regulation S-K.

362

Physiography refers to physical geography. This section requires a description of the property’s
topography, elevation, and vegetation, means of access to the property, the climate and length of the
operating season, as applicable, and the availability of and required infrastructure, including sources of
water, electricity, personnel, and supplies. See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(4) of Regulation S-K.

a description of the nature and extent of all relevant exploration work conducted by or on
behalf of the registrant; 367

363

See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(5) of Regulation S-K.

364

The qualified person must include at least one stratigraphic column and one cross-section of the local
geology to meet these requirements. “Stratigraphic column” refers to the vertical order, by age, of rocks
units (strata). Typically, the oldest rocks are located at the bottom and youngest at the top of the column.
See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(6) of Regulation S-K.

365

Hydrogeology is the branch of geology concerned with the study of the occurrence, distribution, movement
and geological interaction of water. This section requires, among other matters, a description of the nature
and quality of the sampling methods used to acquire data on surface and groundwater parameters, and the
type and appropriateness of laboratory techniques used to test for groundwater flow parameters such as
permeability. See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(7) of Regulation S-K.

366

This section requires a description of the nature and quality of the sampling methods used to acquire
geotechnical data, the type and appropriateness of laboratory techniques used to test for soil and rock
strength parameters, and the results of laboratory testing, including the qualified person’s interpretation and
material assumptions made. See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(8) of Regulation S-K.

372

This section must provide estimates of mineral reserves for all commodities, including estimates of
quantities, grade or quality, cut-off grades, and metallurgical or processing recoveries. It must also provide
the qualified person’s opinion on how the mineral reserve estimates could be materially affected by risk
factors associated with or changes to any aspect of the modifying factors. If a pre-feasibility study is used

380

As proposed, the qualified person may provide a discussion of relevant information concerning an adjacent
property only if such information has been publicly disclosed by the owner or operator of the adjacent
property, the source of the information is identified, and the qualified person states that he or she has been
unable to verify the information and that the information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization
on the property that is the subject of the technical report. In addition, the technical report must clearly
distinguish between the information from the adjacent property and the information from the property that
is the subject of the technical report summary. See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(22) of Regulation SK.

381

If provided, the additional information or explanation must comply with proposed subpart 1300 of
Regulation S-K. See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(23) of Regulation S-K.

382

The qualified person must also discuss in this section any significant risks and uncertainties that could
reasonably be expected to affect the reliability or confidence in the exploration results, mineral resource or
mineral reserve estimates, or projected economic outcomes. See proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(24) of
Regulation S-K.

A technical report summary that reports the results of a preliminary or final feasibility
study would have to include all of the information specified in the above proposed sections. A
technical report summary that reports the results of an initial assessment or that reports material
exploration results could omit information required by certain of the proposed technical report
summary sections. 385
As noted above, these proposed sections are similar in most respects to the items of
information required for the summary report under Canada’s NI 43-101. 386 There are, however,
some notable differences. First, the proposed rules do not permit a qualified person to include a
disclaimer of responsibility if he or she relies on a report, opinion, or statement of another expert
in preparing the technical report summary. 387 We believe such a disclaimer would be
inappropriate since the qualified person, as the professional expert, has prepared and is
responsible for the information contained in the technical report summary. 388 We recognize that
in preparing complex reports of this nature, the responsible person(s) would, when necessary,
rely on information and input from others. Nonetheless, we believe the qualified person, as the
consenting expert, must take responsibility for any report, opinion or statement provided by
385

A technical report summary that reports the results of an initial assessment would have to include, at a
minimum, the information specified in proposed Items 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(1) through (13) and (22) through
(26), and may also include the information specified in proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(21). A technical
report summary that reports material exploration results would have to include, at a minimum, the
information specified in proposed Items 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(1) through (11) and (22) through (26). See
proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(A) of Regulation S-K.

386

See Form 43-101F1 and note 351, supra.

387

In contrast, Canada’s NI 43-101 would permit the qualified person to include a disclaimer of responsibility
if he or she relies on a report, opinion, or statement of another expert who is not a qualified person in
preparing the technical report summary.

388

As previously noted, if the technical report summary is filed as an exhibit to a Securities Act registration
statement, the qualified person will be subject to liability as an expert for any untrue statement or omission
of a material fact contained in the technical report summary under Section 11 of the Securities Act.

158

another person upon which the qualified person has relied. This would help to ensure that the
qualified person has taken the necessary steps to verify any information provided by other
experts that are included in the report. We believe that this standard is both appropriate and
reasonable, as evidenced by its similarity to standards found in the code of ethics of engineering
professionals. 389
In addition, we are proposing to include sections about hydrogeology and geotechnical
data, including testing and analysis, which are not included in NI 43-101. We believe that these
two items are sufficiently important that investors would benefit from having them as separate
requirements, rather than subsumed under other requirements, because they can directly impact
the economic viability of a mining project. Hydrogeology and geotechnical data are the basis for
determining several design parameters that directly impact the safety of the designed mine.
Moreover, these design parameters can affect the operating and capital costs and can, therefore,
directly impact the economics of the mine (i.e., the determination of reserves). Detailed
hydrogeology and geotechnical data would therefore provide insight into the adequacy and
appropriateness of the mine’s design parameters, which would allow investors and their advisors
to evaluate fully the disclosed economic viability of the mine.

389

See, the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) Code of Ethics for Engineers, section II.2,
which states: “Engineers shall perform services only in the areas of their competence. (a) Engineers shall
undertake assignments only when qualified by education or experience in the specific technical fields
involved. (b) Engineers shall not affix their signatures to any plans or documents dealing with subject
matter in which they lack competence, nor to any plan or document not prepared under their direction and
control. (c) Engineers may accept assignments and assume responsibility for coordination of an entire
project and sign and seal the engineering documents for the entire project, provided that each technical
segment is signed and sealed only by the qualified engineers who prepared the segment.”

159

Request for Comment:
109. Should we require the qualified person to include in a technical report summary the 26
items, as proposed? Are there any items of information that we should include instead
of or in addition to the proposed 26 sections of the technical report summary? Are there
any items of information that we should exclude from the proposed technical report
summary?
110.

As previously noted, the qualified person would have to apply and evaluate

relevant modifying factors to assess prospects of economic extraction or to convert
measured and indicated mineral resources to proven or probable mineral reserves. These
would include a variety of factors such as economic, legal, and environmental as
discussed more fully above. For example, to apply and evaluate legal factors the qualified
person must examine the regulatory regime of the host jurisdiction to establish that the
registrant can comply (fully and economically) with all laws and regulations (e.g.,
mining; environmental, including regulations governing water use and impacts, waste
management, and biodiversity impacts; reclamation; and permitting regulations) that are
relevant to operating a mineral project using existing technology. Should we expand
proposed Item 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(19)(vi) to provide additional specific examples, in
addition to those set forth in Items 601(b)(96)(iv)(B)(19)(i)-(iv), of “issues related to
environmental, permitting and social or community factors” that the qualified person
must include in the technical report summary? For example, should we expressly require
that the qualified person include a discussion of other sustainability issues such as how he
or she considered issues related to managing greenhouse gas emissions or workforce
health, safety and well-being? Are there other items for which it would be appropriate to
160

require the qualified person to include a discussion in the technical report summary? If
so, please provide examples and explain why.
111. Should we require, as proposed, a qualified person who prepares a technical report
summary that reports the results of a preliminary or final feasibility study to provide
information for all 26 items? If not, which items should not be required? Should we
require, as proposed, a qualified person who prepares a technical report summary that
reports the results of an initial assessment to provide, at a minimum, the information
specified in paragraphs (iv)(B)(1) through (13) and (iv)(B)(22) through (26) of
proposed Item 601(b)(96)?
112. The proposed rules would permit a qualified person who prepares a technical report
summary that reports the results of an initial assessment to use mineral resources in
economic analysis (and provide the information specified in paragraph (iv)(B)(21) of
proposed Item 601(b)(96)). Should we permit a qualified person to do so if he or she
wishes?
113. Should we require a qualified person who prepares a technical report summary that
reports material exploration results to provide, at least, the information specified in
paragraphs (iv)(B)(1) through (11) and (iv)(B)(22) through (26) of proposed Item
601(b)(96), as proposed?
114. Should we preclude a qualified person from disclaiming responsibility if he or she relies
on a report, opinion, or statement of another expert who is not a qualified person in
preparing the technical report summary, as proposed? Why or why not?
115. Should we require that the technical report summary not include large amounts of
technical or other project data, either in the report or as appendices to the report, as
161

proposed? Why or why not? Should we require a qualified person to draft the technical
report summary to conform, to the extent practicable, with plain English principles
under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, as proposed?

Requirements for Internal Controls Disclosure

Although not called for by Guide 7, some registrants provide disclosure about their
internal controls, including quality control and quality assurance measures, which they have put
in place to help ensure the reliability of their disclosure of exploration results and estimates of
mineral resources and mineral reserves. The staff has also requested, on a case by case basis,
that registrants provide a brief description of the quality control and quality assurance protocols
for sample preparation, controls, custody, assay precision and accuracy as they relate to
exploration programs.
We believe that disclosure about the internal controls that a registrant uses to help ensure
the reliability of its disclosure of exploration results and estimates of mineral resources and
mineral reserves would benefit investors. Accordingly, we are proposing to require that a
registrant describe the internal controls 390 that it uses in its exploration and mineral resource and
reserve estimation efforts. As specified in the proposed rules, such disclosure should address
quality control and quality assurance programs, verification of analytical procedures, and
comprehensive risk inherent in the estimation. 391 Such disclosure would help investors evaluate
whether the registrant has established acceptable levels of certainty and precision during
390

Internal controls in this context refers to the internal controls used to ensure reliable disclosure of
exploration results and estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves. It is not to be confused with
internal control over financial reporting. In this regard, the Commission’s disclosure requirements for
registrants engaged in oil and gas producing activities require similar disclosure of internal controls over
estimation efforts. See Item 1202(a)(7) of Regulation S-K. (17 CFR 229.1202(a)(7)).

See proposed Item 1305 of Regulation S-K.

162

exploration and whether and how it has verified and validated the quality of the data used in its
analysis. In addition, we note that this requirement is consistent with disclosure requirements in
most foreign mining jurisdictions. 392
A proposed instruction would state that a registrant must provide the required internal
controls disclosure whether it is providing summary disclosure under proposed Item 1303,
individual property disclosure under proposed Item 1304, or under both items. 393 Estimating
mineral resources and reserves requires use of statistical techniques to estimate tonnages and
grades based on data derived from laboratory analysis of representative samples. In any such
scientific study, best practice requires the analyst to disclose the quality control and quality
assurance techniques employed to ensure the data used in the analysis is reliable. 394 We believe
this same practice should apply when preparing and analyzing data for the purpose of individual
property disclosure. We also believe an internal controls disclosure requirement is particularly
important for a company with multiple properties in order to ensure that best practice is followed
across all properties.
Moreover, all the CRIRSCO-based codes require the disclosure of quality control and
quality assurance procedures as they relate to exploration results (data) and techniques and
assumptions (analysis) used for mineral resource and reserve estimation. 395 In addition, the

392

See JORC Table 1 checklist and NI 43-101 pt. 3.3, which call for disclosure of quality control and quality
assurance programs. The SME Petition also recognizes the need for and importance of appropriate internal
and disclosure controls in the estimation of mineral reserves. See SME Petition for Rulemaking at 17.

163

listing rules of several of these jurisdictions specifically call for disclosure of the internal
controls relating to estimates of mineral resources and reserves. 396 Our proposal is substantially
similar to these internal control disclosure requirements and therefore should not significantly
alter the disclosure practices of those registrants that are listed in these jurisdictions. For
registrants that are not currently subject to an internal controls disclosure requirement, we
believe investors would benefit from such disclosure, though we recognize that registrants may
incur additional costs.
Request for Comment
116. Should we require registrants to describe the internal controls that they use to help
ensure the reliability of their disclosure of exploration results and estimates of mineral
resources and mineral reserves, as proposed? Should we require that such internal
controls disclosure address quality control and quality assurance programs, verification
of analytical procedures, and comprehensive risk inherent in the estimation, as
proposed? Are there other items, in addition to or in lieu of those proposed items, that
should be included in such disclosure? Are there items that should be excluded from
the proposed internal controls disclosure requirement? In each case, why or why not?

Conforming Changes to Certain Forms Not Subject to Regulation S-K
1.

Form 20-F

Foreign private issuers 397 use Form 20-F 398 as a registration statement under Section 12
of the Exchange Act 399 or as an annual or transition report filed under Section 13(a) 400 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. 401 Form 20-F also provides much of the substantive disclosure
requirements for foreign private issuers filing Securities Act registration statements on Forms F1, 402 F-3 403 and F-4. 404

397

A foreign private issuer is any foreign issuer other than a foreign government, except for an issuer that
has more than 50% of its outstanding voting securities held of record by U.S. residents, and regarding
which any of the following is true: a majority of its officers and directors are citizens or residents of the
United States, more than 50 percent of its assets are located in the United States, or its business is
principally administered in the United States. See Securities Act Rule 405 (17 CFR 230.405) and

The Commission revised Form 20-F in 1999 to conform its disclosure requirements to the
international disclosure standards endorsed by the International Organization of Securities
Commissions (“IOSCO”) in September 1998. 405 As a result, Form 20-F, rather than Regulation
S-K, provides the primary non-financial disclosure requirements for foreign private issuers under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. For example, Item 4.D of Form 20-F sets forth the
disclosure requirements for a foreign private issuer’s property 406 rather than Item 102 of
Regulation S-K.
We believe that the proposed rules should apply equally to foreign private issuers and
domestic registrants. This treatment would be consistent with the current requirements for
foreign private issuers and domestic registrants under Form 20-F 407 and Item 102 of Regulation
S-K whereby both foreign private issuers and domestic registrants provide the disclosures set
forth in Guide 7. 408

405

See Release No. 33-7745 (September 28, 1999), [64 FR 53900] (October 5, 1999).

406

Form 20-F Item 4.D provides that the registrant must provide information regarding any material tangible
fixed assets, including leased properties, and any major encumbrances thereon, including a description of
the size and uses of the property; productive capacity and extent of utilization of the company’s facilities;
how the assets are held; the products produced; and the location. The registrant must also describe any
environmental issues that may affect the company’s utilization of the assets. With regard to any material
plans to construct, expand or improve facilities, the registrant must describe the nature of and reason for the
plan, an estimate of the amount of expenditures including the amount of expenditures already paid, a
description of the method of financing the activity, the estimated dates of start and completion of the
activity, and the increase of production capacity anticipated after completion.

407

Instruction 1 to Item 4 of Form 20-F directs the registrant to “[f]urnish the information specified in any
industry guide listed in Subpart 229.800 of Regulation S-K.”

408

As discussed in section I, supra, Canadian registrants are currently able to provide disclosure pursuant to NI
43-101 under the foreign law exception included in Item 102, Guide 7 and Form 20-F. Accordingly, the
staff has not objected to disclosure by such registrants of resources as well as reserves calculated in
accordance with Canadian law.

166

Accordingly, in order to make foreign private issuers filing on Form 20-F subject to the
new mining disclosure regime, we propose to amend Form 20-F by adding an instruction to Item
4 that issuers engaged in mining operations must refer to and, if required, provide the disclosure
under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. 409 We further propose to remove in their entirety the
current instructions to Item 4.D of Form 20-F, which, among other matters, limit the disclosure
of estimates to proven and probable reserves. 410 Because the proposed rules would require the
disclosure of determined mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration results by
a registrant with material mining operations, the Item 4.D instructions would be inconsistent with
the proposed new disclosure requirements.
In addition, we propose to add an instruction to the exhibits section of Form 20-F stating
that a registrant that is required to file a technical report summary pursuant to Item 1302(b)(2) of
Regulation S-K must provide the information specified in Item 601(b)(96) of Regulation S-K as
an exhibit to its registration statement or annual report on Form 20-F. 411 This would make the
same technical report summary filing requirements applicable to domestic registrants apply as
well to foreign private issuers registering securities or reporting pursuant to Form 20-F.

409

See proposed Instruction 3 to Item 4 of Form 20-F.

410

These instructions provide, among other matters, that, in the case of an extractive enterprise, other than an
oil and gas producing activity, the issuer must provide material information about production, reserves,
locations, developments and the nature of its interest. If individual properties are of major significance, the
issuer must provide more detailed information about those properties and use maps to disclose information
about their location. These instructions further provide that, in documents filed publicly with the
Commission, the issuer must not disclose estimates of reserves unless the reserves are proven or probable
and must not give estimated values of those reserves, unless foreign or state law requires the issuer to
disclose the information. See Instruction 1 to Item 4.D of Form 20-F.

411

See proposed Instruction 17 to Form 20-F. Because Forms F-1, F-3 and F-4 are already subject to the
exhibit requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K, registrants using those forms that meet the
requirements of proposed Item 1302(b)(2) would have to file a technical report summary as an exhibit
pursuant to proposed Item 601(b)(96).

167

Thus, following adoption of these proposed revisions to Form 20-F, foreign private
issuers that use Form 20-F to file their Exchange Act annual reports and registration statements,
or that refer to Form 20-F for their Securities Act registration statements on Forms F-1, F-3 and
F-4, would have to comply with the mining disclosure requirements of new Regulation S-K
subpart 1300. This would include Canadian registrants that report pursuant to Form 20-F and
that currently are permitted to provide mining disclosure under NI 43-101 pursuant to the
“foreign or state law” exception under Item 102 and Guide 7. We note that the proposed
disclosure requirements would be substantially similar to Canada’s NI 43-101. As previously
noted, the proposed rules would eliminate this “foreign or state law” exception. 412 Thus, the sole
group of Canadian registrants that could continue to report pursuant to Canadian disclosure
requirements following adoption of the revised mining disclosure rules would be those Canadian
issuers that report pursuant to the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (“MJDS”). 413 We are
not proposing to subject MJDS registrants to new subpart 1300 because the ability of those
registrants to use their Canadian disclosure documents for purposes of their Exchange Act and
Securities Act filings is based on their eligibility to file under the MJDS, and not on the “foreign
or state law” exception under Guide 7 and Item 102.
Request for Comment
118. Should we amend Form 20-F to conform it to the disclosure requirements of subpart
1300 of Regulation S-K and Item 601(b)(96), as proposed?

412

See section II.E.1, supra.

413

The MJDS permits seasoned Canadian issuers meeting certain other requirements to use their Canadian
disclosure documents when filing their Exchange Act registration statements and annual reports on Form
40-F or their Securities Act registration statements on Forms F-10, F-7, F-8 and F-80.

168

119. Should foreign private issuers that use or refer to Form 20-F for their SEC filings be
subject to the same mining disclosure requirements as domestic mining registrants, as
proposed? Why or why not?
120. Should we continue to permit Canadian issuers to provide disclosure under NI 43-101,
as they are currently allowed to do pursuant to the foreign or state law exception, as an
alternative to providing disclosure under the proposed rules? If so, what would be the
justification for such differential treatment?
2.

Form 1-A

Regulation A provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act for certain securities offerings that satisfy specified conditions, such as filing an offering
statement with the Commission, 414 limiting the dollar amount of the offering 415 and, in certain
instances, filing ongoing reports with the Commission. 416 Form 1-A is the offering statement
used by issuers that are eligible to engage in securities offerings under Regulation A. 417
The Commission amended Regulation A in March of 2015 to permit two tiers of
offerings: Tier 1, for offerings of up to $20 million of securities within a 12-month period; and
414

See Securities Act Rule 251(d) (17 CFR 230.251(d)).

415

See Securities Act Rule 251(a) (17 CFR 230.251(a)).

416

See Securities Act Rule 257 (17 CFR 230.257).

417

17 CFR 230.251 through 230.263. To be eligible to offer securities under Regulation A, at a minimum, an
issuer must be organized and have its principal place of business in the United States or Canada. Excluded
from Regulation A eligibility are: Exchange Act reporting companies; blank check companies; investment
companies registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.
80a-1 et seq.) or business development companies as defined under that Act; issuers of fractional undivided
interests in oil, gas or mineral rights; issuers that have been subject to a Commission order under Exchange
Act Section 12(j) within 5 years preceding the filing of the offering statement; issuers that have failed to
file the reports required by Regulation A (under 17 CFR 230.257) during the two years preceding the filing
of the offering statement; and issuers that have been disqualified under Securities Act Rule 262. See
Securities Act Rule 251(b) (17 CFR 230.251(b)).

169

Tier 2, for offerings of up to $50 million of securities within a 12-month period. 418 The
amendments require the filing and qualification of Form 1-A for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings
and impose ongoing disclosure obligations for Tier 2 offerings. 419 The Commission further
amended Part II of Form 1-A by eliminating the Model A (Question and Answer) disclosure
format and updating the Model B (Narrative) disclosure format allowed for both tier offerings. 420
When updating Item 7 of Part II of Form 1-A concerning the required “Description of
Business” disclosure, the Commission added a provision stating that the disclosure guidelines in
all Securities Act Industry Guides must be followed. The provision also stated that, to the extent
that the industry guides are codified into Regulation S-K, the Regulation S-K industry disclosure
items must be followed. 421
The purpose of this provision was to incorporate into Form 1-A the disclosure guidance
in all of the Securities Act Industry Guides. 422 Moreover, because Regulation S-K does not
directly apply to Form 1-A, the Commission sought to require Form 1-A issuers to follow the

418

See Release No. 33-9741 (March 25, 2015) [80 FR 21806 (April 20, 2015)] (the “2015 Regulation A
Adopting Release”).

419

The Commission adopted new Forms 1-K (annual report), 1-SA (semi-annual report) and 1-U (current
report) for the Tier 2 ongoing reporting regime. The Commission also adopted Form 1-Z, an exit form,
which must be filed by Tier 1 issuers upon termination or completion of the offering and by most Tier 2
issuers when eligible to suspend ongoing reporting.

420

Issuers also have the option of providing disclosure under Part II of Form 1-A that meets the requirements
of Part I of either Form S-1 or Form S-11.

421

See Form 1-A, Part II, Item 7(c).

422

See Release No. 33-9497 (December 18, 2013) [79 FR 3926 (January 23, 2014)] (“Updates to the Offering
Circular would also incorporate the disclosure guidelines in the Securities Act Industry Guides. . .”); see
also the 2015 Regulation A Adopting Release (“As adopted, the Offering Circular includes disclosure
based on disclosure guidelines set forth in the Securities Act Industry Guides. . .”).

170

disclosure guidelines in any industry guides that have been codified as disclosure items under
Regulation S-K.
Because this provision, however, only appears in Item 7(c) of Part II, which governs
“business” disclosure, we are proposing to amend Part II of Form 1-A to apply the scope of the
requirement to the description of property for certain issuers by adding similar language under
Item 8 of Part II to Form 1-A. 423 Specifically, in order to require the Form 1-A property
disclosure requirements to include the mining disclosure provisions under proposed subpart 1300
of Regulation S-K, we propose to add a provision stating that issuers engaged in mining
operations must refer to and, if required, provide the disclosure under subpart 1300 of Regulation
S-K in addition to any disclosure required by Item 8.
We also propose to amend the instruction to Item 8, which currently provides that
“[d]etailed descriptions of the physical characteristics of individual properties or legal
descriptions by metes and bounds are not required and should not be given.” Because much of
the disclosure under proposed subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K would require detailed
descriptions of mining properties, the proposed rules would amend this instruction by excepting
from its scope the disclosure required under these rules, as referenced in paragraph (b) of Item 8.
Thus, Regulation A issuers with material mining operations would be subject to all of the
disclosure requirements in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. In order to require those Regulation
A issuers to be subject to the new subpart’s technical report summary filing requirement, we
423

See proposed Item 8(b) of Form 1-A. Item 8 (Description of Property) currently requires that an issuer:
“[s]tate briefly the location and general character of any principal plants or other material physical
properties of the issuer and its subsidiaries. If any such property is not held in fee or is held subject to any
major encumbrance, so state and briefly describe how held. Include information regarding the suitability,
adequacy, productive capacity and extent of utilization of the properties and facilities used in the issuer’s
business.” The proposed rules would designate this current provision as paragraph (a) of Item 8.

171

propose to amend Item 17 (Description of Exhibits) of Part III under Form 1-A by adding a
provision stating that an issuer that is required to file a technical report summary pursuant to
Item 1302(b)(2) of Regulation S-K must provide the information specified in Item 601(b)(96) of
Regulation S-K as an exhibit to its Form 1-A. 424
Request for Comment
121. Should we amend Form 1-A to require Regulation A issuers engaged in mining
operations to refer to, and if required, provide the disclosure under subpart 1300 of
Regulation S-K, in addition to any disclosure required by Item 8 of that Form, as
proposed? Why or why not? Alternatively, should the disclosure requirements in
proposed subpart 1300 apply to only some Regulation A issuers (e.g., Regulation A
issuers in Tier 2 offerings)? Should we instead exempt all Regulation A issuers from
the proposed subpart 1300 disclosure requirements?
122. In lieu of imposing full subpart 1300 disclosure requirements on Regulation A issuers,
should we limit, in whole or in part, the proposed subpart 1300 disclosure requirements
for issuers in Regulation A offerings? If so, should these requirements be limited only
for issuers in Tier 1 offerings? Why or why not? Further, which provisions of
proposed subpart 1300 should, and should not, apply to issuers in Regulation A
offerings? For example, should we require compliance with Item 1302’s requirement to
file the technical report summary as an exhibit only in Tier 2 offerings?

424

See proposed paragraph (15) under Item 17 of Part III under Form 1-A.

172

123. Would limiting disclosure of the information required under proposed subpart 1300 for
issuers in Regulation A offerings increase the risk of inaccurate disclosure in such
offerings or otherwise increase risks to investors?
III.

GENERAL REQUEST FOR COMMENTS
We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments on any aspect of

our proposals, other matters that might have an impact on the amendments, and any suggestions
for additional changes. With respect to any comments, we note that they are of greatest
assistance to our rulemaking initiative if accompanied by supporting data and analysis of the
issues addressed in those comments and by alternatives to our proposals where appropriate.
IV.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
As discussed above, we are proposing revisions to the property disclosure requirements

for mining registrants under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The proposed revisions are intended to modernize the Commission’s mining disclosure
requirements and policies by aligning them with industry practices and global regulatory
practices and standards. Overall, we believe that the proposed revisions would increase the
amount and quality of information about a registrant’s mining operations available to investors
as well as provide a single source in Regulation S-K for these disclosure obligations. We further
believe that this will facilitate compliance by eliminating the complexity resulting from the
existing structure of Commission disclosure obligations in Regulation S-K and staff disclosure
guidance in Industry Guide 7. 425

425

See SME Petition for Rulemaking at 9.

173

We are mindful of the costs imposed by, and the benefits obtained from, our proposed
revisions. In this section we analyze the expected economic effects of the proposed revisions
relative to the current baseline, which consists of the current regulatory framework and market
practices. We consider the potential economic impact of the proposed revisions on the main
affected parties, including registrants, investors and other financial statement users, and mining
professionals, such as geologists and engineers, who provide services to registrants in support of
mineral exploration and estimation of mineral resources and reserves. Our analysis considers the
anticipated benefits and costs of the proposed revisions as well as the likely impact on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 426
We also analyze the potential benefits and costs of reasonable alternatives to the
proposed revisions. The alternatives we consider below represent different approaches to
achieving the goal of modernizing the Commission’s mining disclosure requirements and
policies. Given the goal of updating the existing regulatory framework, we evaluate the potential
costs and benefits of these alternative approaches against the potential costs and benefits of the
proposed disclosure requirements, rather than against the baseline.
A.

Baseline

To assess the economic impact of the proposed revisions, our baseline consists of the
current disclosure requirements and policies in Item 102 of Regulation S-K, Guide 7 and Form
20-F and current market practices. We also consider the CRIRSCO-based disclosure codes
426

Securities Act Section 2(a) and Exchange Act 3(f) require us, when engaging in rulemaking that requires us
to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in
addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. Further, Exchange Act Section 23(a)(2) requires us, when proposing rules under the Exchange
Act, to consider the impact that any new rule would have on competition and to not adopt any rule that
would impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of
the Exchange Act.

174

because mining registrants compete in the international commodities and capital markets,
making international disclosure standards an important benchmark for investors evaluating
mining companies. Furthermore, these standards are relevant to consider because, as discussed
above, many mining registrants are foreign private issuers or U.S. incorporated registrants with
reporting obligations in foreign jurisdictions. Thus, to the extent that the proposed revisions
align the Commission’s requirements with the CRIRSCO-based disclosure codes, we expect
their economic impact to be lower for these registrants.
1.

Affected Parties

The proposed revisions would primarily affect current and future registrants with mining
activities that are, or would be, subject to the mining disclosure requirements and policies
contained in Item 102 of Regulation S-K and in Guide 7. In addition to U.S. registrants with
mining operations that are required to report under Regulation S-K in their annual reports and
registration statements, the proposed revisions would affect foreign private issuers with mining
operations that file their Exchange Act annual reports and registration statements using Form 20F, or that refer to Form 20-F for certain of their disclosure obligations under Securities Act
registration statements filed on Forms F-1, F-3 and F-4. Moreover, the affected registrants
would include mining companies filing Form 1-A offering statements under Regulation A.
Investors, analysts, and other users of the information in the registrants’ annual reports and
registration statements filed with the Commission would also be affected by the proposed
revisions. Finally, mining professionals, such as geologists and mining engineers, who provide
services to registrants related to exploration and estimation of mineral resources and reserves
would be potentially affected due to the proposed qualified person requirement and related
provisions.
175

To estimate the number of current registrants that would be potentially affected by the
proposed revisions, we first consider the active registrants as of December 2015 that filed annual
reports or relevant registration statements at least once from January 2014 through December
2015. We then identify registrants with mining primary Standard Industrial Classification
(“SIC”) codes. 427 We also identify those registrants without mining primary SIC codes that
provide disclosure concerning their mining operations in their SEC filings pursuant to Item 102
of Regulation S-K and Guide 7. Based on this approach, we estimate that the total number of
potentially affected registrants is 345 (50 of which are registrants that do not have mining
primary SIC codes).
Among these registrants, we anticipate that the proposed revisions would have a more
significant effect on those mining registrants that are not currently reporting based on CRIRSCO
standards. To estimate the number of registrants reporting based on CRIRSCO standards, we
identify those registrants incorporated in jurisdictions using CRIRSCO-based codes in addition
to those U.S. incorporated registrants that we can manually verify are cross or dual listed, or
otherwise reporting, in CRIRSCO jurisdictions. Out of 345 registrants, we identify 129
registrants—85 foreign private issuers and 44 U.S. registrants—that are potentially reporting
mining operations according to CRIRSCO-based disclosure standards. Accordingly, we estimate
that there are 216 identified registrants that solely report to the Commission and would therefore
be more significantly affected by the proposed revisions than registrants that report elsewhere.
Included among the 129 registrants that are potentially reporting mining operations
according to CRIRSCO-based disclosure standards are 63 Canadian registrants. As discussed
427

Specifically, the mining SIC codes considered are 1000, 1011, 1021, 1031, 1040, 1041, 1044, 1061, 1081,
1090, 1094, 1099, 1220, 1221, 1222, 1231, 1400, 1422, 1423, 1429, 1442, 1446, 1455, 1459, 1474, 1475,
1479, 1481, 1499, 3300, 3334, and 6795.

176

above, Canadian registrants are currently able to provide disclosure in their Commission filings
pursuant to NI 43-101, in addition to the disclosure called for by Guide 7 or Form 20-F. A
number of the proposed revisions would more closely align our disclosure requirements with
those in NI 43-101. As such, we estimate that the Canadian registrants that are currently
providing disclosure pursuant to NI 43-101 likely would be less significantly affected by the
proposed revisions than the 66 non-Canadian registrants that are potentially reporting mining
operations according to CRIRSCO-based disclosure standards. 428
2.

Current Regulatory Framework and Market Practices

As discussed in Sections I and II above, we evaluate the economic effects of the proposed
revisions against the Commission’s current disclosure requirements and policies. Below we
discuss three economically important aspects: (1) the structure and detail of the current
disclosure framework, (2) the scope of the current disclosure framework, and (3) the lack of an
expertise requirement for the preparer of technical information in the disclosures.
i.

Structure and Detail of Current Disclosure Framework

The following aspects of the current disclosure regime may give rise to compliance
challenges for mining registrants:
•

Overlapping disclosure framework. The current disclosure framework is set forth in Item
102 of Regulation S-K, which is a Commission rule, Form 20-F, which is a form used by
foreign private issuers that contains disclosure requirements, 429 and Industry Guide 7,

428

For example, the technical report summary requirement in our proposed rule is very similar to the NI 43101 requirement to file a technical report summary. That requirement is not, however, part of the other
CRIRSCO-based codes, so only Canadian filers would not incur an additional cost to prepare the summary
report.

429

See 17 CFR 249.220f.

177

which represents the disclosure policies and practices followed by the Division of
Corporation Finance. This overlapping structure may give rise to unnecessary
compliance burdens for mining registrants. 430
•

Multiple thresholds for disclosure. Item 102 of Regulation S-K currently implies a twotiered reporting standard. Registrants with “significant” mining operations are referred to
the more extensive disclosure policies in Guide 7, whereas registrants without significant
mining operations but with one or more “principal” mines or other “materially important”
properties are required to comply with only the more limited disclosure requirements in
Item 102. As discussed above, Commission staff historically has advised that registrants
apply a materiality standard for disclosure and, when that standard is met, provide
disclosure according to both Item 102 and Guide 7.

•

Level of detail. Because the disclosure policies in Guide 7 are broadly drafted, registrants
often rely on staff guidance to apply those policies. For example, as discussed above,
Guide 7 calls for the disclosure of mineral reserves, defined as the part of a mineral
deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced. It does not, however,
specify the level of geological evidence or the analysis required, such as the modifying
factors the registrant should consider, to convert existing mineral deposits to reserves.
By contrast, the CRIRSCO standards specify a more detailed framework for
determination and disclosure of mineral reserves that specifically addresses such issues.
These aspects of the current disclosure framework may have rendered it unnecessarily

complex and confusing for mining registrants, especially new registrants. In this regard, industry

430

See section II.A and note 26, supra.

178

participants have raised concerns regarding the need to rely on informal staff guidance to ensure
compliance. 431 Reliance on staff guidance also may affect the consistency of the disclosures,
which can impact comparability across registrants and over time for investors.
ii.

Scope of the Current Disclosure Requirements and Policies

The technological process for evaluating the value of a mineral property starts with
mineral exploration, then continues with estimation of mineral resources (i.e., the quantity and
quality of the material of interest that has economic prospects of extraction), which in turn forms
the basis for the estimation of mineral reserves (i.e., the amount of material that can be extracted
economically). As discussed above, Item 102 of Regulation S-K, Guide 7 and Form 20-F
currently call for the disclosure of mineral reserves and preclude the disclosure of non-reserve
estimates such as mineral resources unless required by foreign or state law. In practice, only
Canadian issuers have been able to take advantage of this exception because only Canada has
adopted its mining disclosure requirements as a matter of law. 432 In addition, none of Guide 7,
Item 102 of Regulation S-K or Form 20-F calls for or requires disclosure of mineral exploration
results. By contrast, CRIRSCO-based codes require disclosure of material exploration results
and material mineral resources in addition to material mineral reserves.
The scope of the Commission’s current disclosure regime relative to current industry
practices for evaluating the prospects of mining properties can result in mining registrants
omitting from their disclosures information about their mineral resources they possess but are not
allowed to disclose. Omitting such information may increase the information asymmetries

431

Id.

432

See note 14, supra.

179

between mining registrants and investors, which could lead to potentially negative capital market
consequences, such as reduced stock market liquidity and higher cost of capital. 433 Moreover,
because mining companies providing disclosure in foreign jurisdictions based on CRIRSCO
standards are required to disclose material exploration results and mineral resources, U.S.
registrants may suffer adverse competitive effects to the extent that the more limited scope of
their disclosures has negative capital market effects. Industry participants have raised concerns
regarding the adverse competitive effects potentially stemming from the current disclosure
regime and, in particular, from the inability to disclose mineral resources. 434
Currently, registrants can supplement, to some extent, the limited scope of the current
disclosure regime in two ways. First, although there is no requirement to disclose material
exploration results, registrants can voluntarily disclose such information in their SEC filings.
However, the value of such voluntary disclosures to investors may be reduced in the absence of a
requirement that ensures consistency and quality of the disclosures. Second, regarding the
disclosure of mineral resources, Commission staff has, on a case-by-case basis, not objected to
disclosure of non-reserve mineral deposits in the form of “mineralized material.” In practice,
although the mineral resources covered by the definition of “mineralized material” generally
correspond with the indicated and measured mineral resource categories defined in the
CRIRSCO standards, they are not completely consistent with CRIRSCO resource categories.
For example, Commission staff historically has advised registrants that they should not disclose
433

The link between asymmetric information and cost of capital is well established in the academic literature.
See, e.g., Douglas W. Diamond and Robert. E. Verrecchia “Disclosure. Liquidity, and the Cost of Capital”
(1991), Journal of Finance, Volume 46, Issue 4, pp. 1325 -1359, and David Easley and Maureen O’Hara,
“Information and the cost of capital” (2004), Journal of Finance, Volume 59, Issue 4, pp. 1553-1583.

434

See note 27, supra.

180

as mineralized material in their SEC filings non-reserve mineral deposits that would be
equivalent to inferred resources. Moreover, the absence of specific, published guidelines
establishing how registrants should estimate and report mineralized materials may have
contributed to compliance uncertainty and lack of consistency in the disclosures.
As discussed above, disclosure of mineral resources is currently prohibited unless
required by foreign or state law. 435 Under this exception, Canadian registrants are able to
disclose mineral resources in SEC filings if they do so in their Canadian filings. Therefore, any
potential competitive disadvantage of not being allowed to disclose mineral resources in SEC
filings primarily affects U.S. registrants and non-Canadian foreign registrants, 436 which in our
estimates represent about 82% of the registrants potentially affected by the proposed revisions.
Given this, and also given that the disclosures of mineralized material that are currently
permitted in SEC filings are not directly comparable to the disclosures of mineral resources
required by the CRIRSCO standards, some registrants have reported their mineral resources in
press releases, on their website, or in their annual reports. Such disclosures, made outside of
SEC filings, may present risks for investors who rely on such disclosures. First, these disclosures
are not subject to the full range of disclosure rules and regulations, including corresponding
liability provisions, to which SEC filings are subject (although disclosures outside SEC filings
would be subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws), are not subject to staff
review and comment, and may not be reported using commonly recognized standards.

435

See note 14, supra.

436

See SME Petition for Rulemaking at 14.

181

iii.

Role of Experts in Support of Disclosures of Mineral Reserves

As discussed above, Guide 7 provides, and Form 20-F requires that a registrant disclose
the name of the person estimating the reserves and describe the nature of his or her relationship
to the registrant. There is, however, no current disclosure policy or requirement in Guide 7, Item
102 or Form 20-F that a registrant must base disclosures of mineral reserves (or a study or
technical report supporting such disclosures) on findings of a professional with a particular level
of expertise. The absence of an expertise requirement is in contrast to the CRIRSCO-based
codes, which all require that disclosures of mineral reserves—as well as exploration results and
mineral resources—be based on information and supporting documentation prepared by a
“competent” or “qualified person.” 437
In the absence of an expertise requirement, disclosures of exploration results, mineral
resources and mineral reserves may be viewed as less credible. The lack of an expertise
requirement may put U.S. registrants at a comparative disadvantage in terms of how investors
value the disclosed information compared to companies disclosing mineral resources and
reserves based on CRIRSCO-based codes. 438
B.

Analysis of Potential Economic Effects

In this section, we analyze the anticipated costs and benefits associated with the proposed
437

An author of a study or technical report that forms the basis of mineral reserves disclosure in a Securities
Act registration statement is required to consent to the use of his or her name as an expert, and is therefore
subject to expert liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act. See also 17 CFR 230.436 and 17 CFR
229.601(b)(23). While this provides some assurance that the disclosure accurately reflects the technical
study or report, it does not require that the author have any minimum level of technical expertise.

438

Under the current disclosure regime, registrants can choose to hire an expert with similar qualifications as
those required by the CRIRSCO standards and voluntarily disclose this fact to mitigate any competitive
disadvantage. However, investors may discount such disclosures if they are not derived from a formal
regulatory requirement. Moreover, investors that tend to diversify their investments across companies in the
mining sector, rather than in any specific mining company, may discount the sector as a whole in
jurisdictions that are perceived to have less robust disclosure standards in this regard.

182

revisions to the mining disclosure requirements.
1.

Consolidation and Harmonization of the Mining Disclosure
Requirements

As discussed above, the proposed revisions would consolidate the mining disclosure
requirements and policies of Regulation S-K and Guide 7 into new subpart 1300 of Regulation
S-K, and rescind Guide 7. Codifying the current mining disclosure requirements in Regulation
S-K would provide a single source for a mining registrant’s disclosure obligations, eliminating
the complexity associated with the fact that Guide 7 provides staff guidance and is not
incorporated in the Commission rules, such as in Regulation S-K, thus facilitating compliance
and promoting more consistent disclosures to investors.
As described in Section II.A.1, the proposed revisions would replace the current multiple
standards for disclosure (i.e., “principal” mines, “other materially important” physical properties,
and “significant” mining operations) included in Item 102 of Regulation S-K with a single
materiality standard for when a registrant must provide disclosure about its mining properties or
operations. The definition of “material” in the proposed rule would be the same as under
Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. This single standard should reduce any
confusion or compliance uncertainty that arises from the current multiple standards. In
addition, the proposed rules would provide more detailed guidance to registrants about how to
apply the proposed standard under varied circumstances, 439 which should further reduce
compliance uncertainty and help ensure consistency in the disclosures. Finally, given that the
proposed standard is similar to the disclosure standard under the CRIRSCO-based mining codes,

439

See, e.g., section II.B.1.i-iii, supra.

183

the proposed revision would harmonize the U.S. standard with global practice. 440
The proposed standard would generally be consistent with current staff guidance for
applying the existing disclosure thresholds. To the extent that registrants currently follow this
guidance in determining which disclosures to make concerning their mining operations, the
proposed new threshold would not significantly alter existing disclosure practices.
As discussed above, the proposed rules would redefine the classifications of
“exploration,” “development” and “production” stage so that they apply to individual properties
as well as the totality of a registrant’s mining activities, the latter of which is the case in Guide 7.
This individual property classification would in turn guide the classification of the registrant as a
whole, as described above in Section II.A.2. Applying the classification of the technological
stages at the property level should have several potential benefits. First, by providing the
classification at the property level, the proposed rules would provide more precise information to
investors about the nature and risk of registrants’ mining operations. In addition, because the
classification at registrant level would be derived from the individual property classifications, the
proposed rules would prevent a registrant without material reserves from characterizing itself as
a development stage or production stage company, which is possible under the current
classification scheme. 441 Second, since many registrants have mining properties in different
stages, the proposed rules would instruct how registrants should apply the definitions to their
operations, thereby reducing compliance uncertainty. Third, the proposed rules would align the
disclosure requirements with current accounting practice under U.S. GAAP and IFRS (as issued

440

See section II.B.1, supra.

441

See note 65, supra.

184

by the IASB), 442 facilitating consistency among the disclosures. Because registrants already
possess the information necessary to be able to classify properties at the individual property
level, and the proposed classifications are consistent with current accounting practice, we do not
expect a significant increase in compliance costs for registrants.
2.

Qualified Person and Technical Report Summary Requirements

As discussed above, we propose to require that every disclosure of mineral resources,
mineral reserves and material exploration results be based on and accurately reflect information
and supporting documentation prepared by an identified qualified person. Moreover, we propose
to require that, for each material mining property, registrants obtain and file a signed and dated
technical report summary prepared by this qualified person.
We anticipate that the qualified person requirement paired with the technical report
summary requirement would enhance the accuracy, transparency, and credibility of the proposed
disclosures for investors. For example, the requirement that the qualified person have at least
five years of relevant experience and be an eligible member or licensee in good standing of a
recognized professional association should ensure that the estimates provided in the disclosures
are based on work consistent with current professional best practice. This should in turn increase
the reliability and informational value of the disclosures. Moreover, the technical report
summaries for material mining properties would provide investors and analysts with technical
details to allow them to improve their own individual assessments of the value of the mining
properties, including better estimates for their own forecasting models. These anticipated
benefits should be especially pronounced in conjunction with the proposed disclosures of mineral

442

See note 68, supra.

185

resources and material exploration results, since estimates of mineral resources and material
exploration results are typically associated, for technological reasons, with a higher degree of
uncertainty compared to estimates of mineral reserves.
These potential benefits from the proposed qualified person requirement are not without
associated costs. 443 Regarding the proposed qualified person requirement, we expect any
increase in compliance costs to be related to an increase in search and hiring costs of qualified
persons. Registrants that are not currently employing or contracting with professionals meeting
the proposed definition of qualified person would incur costs, including expenses for identifying
a pool of professionals that would meet the definition of qualified person and be willing to
provide their services. The costs for services of a qualified person may also increase for such
registrants due to the level of expertise required under the proposed rules. Because the required
disclosures derive from activities mining registrants are already performing as a crucial part of
their businesses (i.e., mineral exploration and estimation of mineral resources and reserves), we
believe that most registrants likely already engage experienced professionals meeting the
proposed level of expertise, either as employees or as contractors. In particular, this should be
the case for registrants reporting based on CRIRSCO standards, as those disclosure codes already
require a similarly defined “qualified” or “competent” person to support the disclosures. To the
extent registrants already engage professionals meeting the proposed qualified person
requirement, the incremental compliance costs of the proposed requirement would be minimal or

443

Quantifying these cost are challenging due to data limitations. For example, we do not have access to data
that would allow us to more precisely measure the current supply of mining professionals meeting the
definition of a “qualified person.” We also do not have access to readily available data sources of
comprehensive compensation data for geologists and mining engineers (in the United Sates or other
countries), which would help us estimate the marginal cost of hiring a qualified person with the minimum
level of expertise versus professionals that do not qualify as qualified persons.

186

none.
Registrants that are currently employing or contracting with professionals meeting the
proposed definition of a qualified person would not incur costs associated with hiring such a
person but may nevertheless experience an increase in compensation costs. One reason for such
an increase is that qualified persons would provide, sign and consent to the filing of more
extensive documentation in support of the disclosures, which potentially would expose them to
greater legal liability. Moreover, if the qualified person requirement reduces the pool of eligible
mining professionals, compensation costs could increase due to increased competition among
registrants for the services of these eligible professionals. However, we anticipate this
competitive effect on compensation costs to be minor as there is currently a large pool of
professionals both in the United States and around the world that would meet the definition of
qualified person. For example, the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration currently
has 15,000 members around the world. 444 More than 800 of these members are registered with
the organization and already meet the definition of a qualified person. 445 Moreover, a study by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in 2014 there were 34,000 geoscientists, 16,500
geological and petroleum technicians, and 8,300 mining and geological engineers employed in
the United States. 446 A significant fraction of these professionals would likely meet the

definition of qualified person, or could meet it after some professional development. 447 For
example, California alone had more than 5,000 recorded licensed professional geologists as of
November 2014. 448 We note that these estimates largely exclude professionals who are active in
foreign markets and who could also qualify.
Regarding the proposed technical report summary requirement, we expect that registrants
would experience an increase in compliance costs related to the preparation of the report
summaries for material mining properties. 449 Even registrants that currently produce technical
documentation and reports in compliance with requirements in other jurisdictions would likely
incur additional costs to conform the reports to the specific requirements in the proposed rule. In
this regard, the proposal seeks to limit the additional compliance costs by requiring that a
registrant only has to file a technical report for material properties, rather than for all its
properties, and only when the registrant is first reporting, or reporting a material change in,
exploration results, resources and reserves.
The proposed qualified person and technical report summary requirements are similar to
447

The increased demand for qualified persons’ services is likely to incentivize more professionals to become
qualified.

448

See the website of the National Association of State Boards of Geology,
http://asbog.org/states/cd_states.htm#California. A geologist licensed by any state in the United States,
provided they have five years’ relevant experience in mining with respect to the type of mineralization
under consideration, would likely meet the proposed definition of a qualified person.

449

It is challenging to estimate reliably the compliance costs associated with the requirement to prepare a
technical report summary because of the diversity in the scope and complexity of the reports that are to be
summarized and the labor costs (by sector of the industry and geographic location). Also, we could not
find any studies that have examined this question. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, based on
staff analysis of similar reporting requirements in other jurisdictions, we estimate that registrants would
each incur between 11 and 50 burden hours to prepare the required technical report summary, depending on
whether they are subject to CRIRSCO standards. These estimates assume that all the information required
to prepare a technical report summary is already available to the qualified person as part of the scientific
and engineering assessment required to support disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources, and
mineral reserves. See Section V, infra.

188

the corresponding requirements in the CRIRSCO-based disclosure codes, which generally should
mitigate the incremental impact of the proposed requirements on registrants currently reporting
in jurisdictions that use these codes. However, some of the differences may be economically
important. For example, although the CRIRSCO jurisdictions require that a company’s
exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves be based on and fairly reflect
information and supporting documentation prepared by a “competent” or “qualified” person,
only Canada and Australia require the filing of a technical report summary to support such
disclosure. 450 Accordingly, we expect that the proposed technical report summary requirement
would increase the costs of compliance for registrants currently reporting in foreign jurisdictions
other than Canada and Australia. On the other hand, these registrants would receive the
incremental benefits (identified above) associated with the filing of such report summaries.
The proposed rules do not require the qualified person to be independent of the registrant.
The absence of an independence requirement is consistent with the CRIRSCO-based codes, with
the exception of Canada where the qualified person supporting the registrant’s mining
disclosures must be independent of the company for new registrants or, in cases of significant
changes to existing disclosures, for established registrants. 451 Although there is some evidence
that outside experts reduce information asymmetries about companies’ valuations in related

450

Canada’s NI 43-101 requires a registrant to file a technical report summary, substantially similar to what
we are proposing, for each material mining property. See NI 43-101 pt. 4. That Instrument also prescribes
the form of the technical report summary. See Form 43-101F1. Australia’s ASX requires all public
disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves to be accompanied by an appendix
that reports pursuant to JORC Table 1. See ASX Listing Rules 5.7.1, 5.8.2 and 5.9.2. This requirement is
equivalent to requiring an abbreviated version of the technical report summary.

451

See NI 43-101 pt. 5.3.

189

circumstances, 452 we believe this benefit should be balanced against the additional cost of having
to find and hire an outside expert, instead of using an existing affiliated expert. Moreover, an
outside expert may in practice not be independent of the company if the person derives a large
fraction of overall compensation from that same company. We also believe that the expert
liability incurred under Section 11 of the Securities Act would mitigate the potential for
misleading or fraudulent disclosures by all qualified persons, whether or not the person is
affiliated with the company or an independent expert.
We have considered reasonable alternatives to the proposed qualified person and
technical report summary requirements. One alternative would be not to require or define the
professional requirements of the expert producing information and supporting documents for the
disclosures, but to require that registrants disclose the relevant qualifications and professional
background of the expert as well as any affiliation with the registrant. Investors could use this
information to decide for themselves if the expert is likely to be competent and reliable.
Compared to the proposed rule, this alternative would potentially lower costs for the services
provided by qualified persons since registrants could hire from a broader population of experts.
Moreover, registrants that already use experts not meeting the definition of a qualified person
under the proposed rule would avoid switching costs. However, this alternative would
potentially lead to less consistency in the type of expertise and quality of reports across firms.
Moreover, this alternative would significantly differ from the approach in the CRIRSCO
standards of requiring a minimum level of expertise in support of the disclosures. As a result,
452

See, e.g., Karl A. Muller III and Edward J. Riedl, "External Monitoring of Property Appraisal Estimates
and Information Asymmetry" (2002), Journal of Accounting Research, Volume 40, Issue 3, pp. 865-881.
Using a sample of UK investment property firms, the paper finds that bid-ask spreads are lower for firms
employing external appraisers of property values versus those employing internal appraisers, suggesting the
information asymmetry about the value of the company is lower in the former case.

190

even when keeping the actual level of competence of experts constant across jurisdictions, this
alternative could lead to a perception among investors that disclosures of mineral resources and
reserves within SEC filings are not as well supported as disclosures in the CRIRSCO
jurisdictions, which could discourage investors from investing in securities of mining companies
listed in the U.S. markets.
Another alternative would be not to require the filing of a technical report summary to
reduce expected compliance costs and be consistent with the majority of CRIRSCO-based codes.
Under this alternative, the potential benefits discussed above that come from investors having
access to the information in the technical report summary would be foregone.
3.

Treatment of Exploration Results

The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose material exploration results (as
and if determined by a qualified person) for each of its material mining properties. This
proposed disclosure requirement would align the Commission’s disclosure requirements for
exploration results with those in CRIRSCO-based codes. The proposed rules also would provide
guidance for registrants when exploration results are considered material.
Although the Commission’s current disclosure requirements and policies do not provide
for the disclosure of exploration results, some registrants disclose exploration results on a
voluntary basis. Presumably, registrants currently providing such voluntary disclosures benefit
from doing so. From an individual mining registrant’s perspective, the proposed requirements
would be beneficial if the associated incremental economic benefits exceed the incremental costs
of complying with the disclosure requirements, as proposed. From an investor’s perspective, the
proposed rule would be incrementally beneficial if the expected benefit in terms of more efficient
investment decisions due to the additional information exceeds the cost of processing the same
191

information.
Because a new mining project inevitably starts from some form of exploration activity,
disclosure of material exploration results would provide important information to investors about
registrants’ mining operations and potential growth opportunities. We expect the disclosure of
exploration results by smaller mining registrants to be especially useful to investors as such
registrants tend to have a narrower range of mining operations and fewer individual projects. We
estimate that a majority of mining registrants are very small firms: 51% of mining registrants
(176 out of the 345 registrants identified above) have $5 million or less in total assets, suggesting
they are mainly exploration stage registrants.
It is important to recognize that exploration results, by themselves, without the
assessment of geologic and grade continuity required in resource estimation, are inherently
speculative. Thus, it may be difficult for investors to value exploration results accurately and
there is a risk that some investors would put too much weight on this information, which in turn
could lead to inefficient investment decisions. The proposed requirements are intended to
mitigate any potential costs related to the uncertainty associated with the disclosure of
exploration results in a couple of ways. First, the proposed rules would preclude the use of
exploration results, by themselves, to derive estimates of tonnage, grade, and production rates, or
in an assessment of economic viability. This should reduce the potential for overvaluing the
disclosed exploration results. Second, disclosure of material exploration results must be based
on the analysis of a qualified person submitting a technical report summary that is filed as an
exhibit with the Commission. The proposed qualified person and technical report summary
requirements should increase the accuracy and reliability of the disclosed exploration results.
In addition, the proposed requirements would also increase the usefulness of this information to
192

investors by aligning the disclosure of material exploration results with the requirements in
CRIRSCO-based codes, which would improve the comparability of the disclosed information
relative to similar disclosures by mining companies in jurisdictions such as Canada and
Australia.
Quantifying the anticipated net benefit to investors from the proposed disclosure
requirement is difficult. There is some academic evidence suggesting that investors respond
favorably to the disclosures of exploration results. For example, an academic study of 1,260
exploration results announcements made by 307 unique Australian mining companies over the
2005−2008 time period documents an average abnormal stock return of 2.8% on the
announcement day. 453 For each such company, the abnormal return was calculated relative to
the return on the same day for a size-matched non-announcing commodity peer. Consistent with
exploration results being more value relevant for smaller firms, the study also finds a
significantly higher announcement day return for smaller firms, where size is measured by preannouncement market capitalization. We also note that the announcements of explorations
results in the sample were compliant with the 2004 edition of the Australian JORC code for
mining disclosure, which contains requirements for disclosure of exploration results that are
similar to the proposed requirements. 454
We expect an increase in compliance costs for those registrants that disclose material
exploration results for the first time for any particular project. These costs would include the

reserve announcements by mining companies: Australian data” (2013), Australian Journal of Management,
Volume 38, Issue 2, pp. 311–331.

454

See the JORC Code, 2004 Edition, pts. 16, 17, and 18.

193

assessment of materiality, the costs of preparing the required technical report summary, and the
costs of reporting the results in annual reports and registration statements filed with the
Commission. To the extent that these costs are fixed rather than scaled to the size of the project,
the cost burden would be relatively larger for smaller registrants.
We note that the proposed requirement to disclose material exploration results does not
impose an affirmative obligation to hire a qualified person to make a determination about
exploration results. Registrants who perceive that the compliance costs related to engaging a
qualified person are prohibitive can refrain from engaging a qualified person to make a
determination about the exploration results. In that situation, the registrant would not be required
to disclose material exploration results because the required information and documentation by
an expert necessary to support the public disclosure of material exploration results would not be
present.
The compliance costs of the proposed disclosure requirement should be substantially
mitigated for registrants that already report based on CRIRSCO standards, as those standards
have similar disclosure requirements for material exploration results.
The proposed rules require disclosure of determined material exploration results only
with respect to individually material properties. 455 One alternative to the proposed requirement
would be also to require disclosure of material exploration results when the registrant has
determined that the aggregate mining operations are material but no individual property is
material. 456 Relative to the proposed rules, this alternative would provide investors with more

455

See Section II.D., supra.

456

See Section II.B.1, supra.

194

information concerning the prospects of the registrant’s mining operations but it would be
significantly costlier for affected registrants. The costs of this alternative could be mitigated by
requiring the additional material exploration results to be presented in summary form.
4.

Treatment of Mineral Resources

As discussed above, disclosure of mineral resources is currently precluded in SEC filings
unless required pursuant to foreign or state law. Industry participants have raised concerns
regarding the adverse competitive effects potentially stemming from the inability of U.S.
registrants to disclose mineral resources. 457 These industry participants have stated that mining
companies and their investors consider mineral resource estimates to be material and
fundamental information about a company and its projects. 458
The proposed rule would require a registrant with material mining operations to disclose
specified information concerning any mineral resources that have been determined based on
information and supporting documentation from a qualified person. In the absence of such
information and supporting documentation, the registrant would not have mineral resources as
defined in the proposed rules, and as such, would not be required or allowed to disclose mineral
resources in a SEC filing. 459
As proposed, a registrant with material mining operations that has multiple properties
would be required to provide both summary disclosure about its mineral resources in addition to

457

See note 27, supra.

458

See SME Petition for Rulemaking at 1 and 13.

459

In other words, the disclosure requirement would not be triggered if the registrant chose not to hire a
qualified person because it would lack the information and documentation to support the disclosure of
mineral resources, as required by the proposed rule.

195

more detailed disclosure concerning its mineral resources for each material property. 460 As
discussed above, the proposed requirement would expand the scope of the current disclosure
regime, while aligning the Commission’s mining disclosure rules with those in foreign
jurisdictions based on the CRIRSCO standards.
We expect the proposed framework for disclosure of mineral resources to result in
additional useful information concerning a registrant’s operations and prospects. Because
mining registrants already assess mineral resources in the course of developing mining projects,
requiring information about mineral resources to be disclosed would significantly reduce the
information asymmetries between investors and registrants. Reducing information asymmetry
relating to mineral resources should lower the cost of capital and improve capital formation. 461
Moreover, since the CRIRSCO-based codes already require similar disclosure of mineral
resources, the proposed framework would improve competition among mining registrants by
removing the competitive disadvantage that U.S. registrants currently experience relative to
reporting firms in foreign jurisdictions. This also may improve the attractiveness of U.S. capital
markets for mining companies. Similar to the case of the proposed requirement to disclose
material exploration results, the proposed requirement to disclose mineral resources may be
particularly beneficial to smaller exploration stage mining registrants (and their investors) as
their valuations may be more dependent on non-reserve mineral deposits.
We note that for registrants that currently disclose “mineralized materials” there should
460

See the discussion in Section II.B, supra.

461

Although we expect disclosures that reduce information asymmetries to reduce cost of capital for the
typical mining company, we also expect there to be a reallocation of capital from relatively low quality
companies to higher quality companies as better information on the companies’ prospects are revealed.
This reallocation would help improve efficiency and capital formation overall, but also means that some
poorer quality mining companies would likely experience a higher cost of capital.

196

be a comparatively lower incremental reduction in information asymmetries. Nonetheless, the
proposed framework would result in disclosures that are more consistently presented and more
transparent to investors, thereby increasing comparability of such information across mining
registrants. For example, the differences between measured and indicated mineral resources
would be clear under the proposed rules since they will be distinct and not aggregated as
mineralized material. The proposed requirement that the disclosures must be supported by
information and documentation provided by a qualified person would also improve the quality
and reliability of the disclosures compared to the current disclosures of mineralized material. To
the extent the above expected incremental improvement in disclosure to investors reduces
information asymmetries, the efficiency of investment decisions would increase and registrants
that currently disclose mineralized material may still experience a reduction in cost of capital.
Finally, relative to the current practice for disclosure of mineralized materials, requiring the
disclosure of mineral resources by rule should reduce registrant uncertainty and facilitate
compliance.
Estimates of mineral resources are typically associated with a greater uncertainty than
estimates of mineral reserves. To help investors better assess the uncertainty surrounding
mineral resource estimates, the proposed disclosure framework would mandate a classification of
mineral resources into inferred, indicated and measured mineral resources, in order of increasing
confidence based on the level of underlying geological evidence, with the estimates for inferred
mineral resources being the most uncertain. 462 In addition, we are proposing that resource
disclosures must be supported by an initial assessment by a qualified person and that this
462

Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with inferred resources, we note that registrants may have an
incentive to aggressively report such resources. However, this incentive would be mitigated by not
allowing inferred resources to later be directly converted to mineral reserves. See section II.E.2, supra.

197

assessment, at a minimum, must include a qualitative evaluation of modifying factors to establish
the economic potential of the mining property or project. We believe that requiring an initial
assessment by a qualified person would reduce the uncertainty surrounding mineral resource
estimates and increase the value of the information for investors. Specifically, we believe that a
well-defined and specific technical study to support disclosure of mineral resources should
improve the accuracy and reliability of the mineral resource estimates for investors. Since
estimates of mineral reserves are based on estimates of mineral resources, the greater accuracy of
the resource findings should lead to better mineral reserve determinations.
The proposed rule would generate compliance costs for registrants with material mining
operations that disclose mineral resources. The increase in costs would be greater for registrants
not currently disclosing mineralized material. The costs would include the incremental costs
(above the registrant’s mineral resource assessment practices) of the initial assessment and the
costs of preparing the technical report summary, in the case that one is required. As discussed
above, if registrants are currently using a professional who would not meet the qualified person
definition, search costs and potentially higher compensation costs may also be incurred. In
deciding whether to disclose mineral resources, we expect companies would weigh the
incremental compliance costs of producing reports that meet the required standards against the
expected benefits stemming from such disclosure, based on their individual facts and
circumstances.
The compliance costs associated with the proposed framework for disclosure of mineral
resources would be mitigated to some extent for registrants that report in foreign jurisdictions
with CRIRSCO-based disclosure codes given the similarity between the requirements in those
codes and our proposal. In this regard, however, although all CRIRSCO-based codes require
198

some type of study to support the determination and disclosure of mineral resources, most do not
define a specific type of study. As such, the proposed initial assessment requirement could result
in increased burdens for these mining registrants to the extent that our proposed initial
assessment differs from registrants’ practices for determining resources.
For example, although the CRIRSCO-based codes prohibit the use of inferred mineral
resources to support a determination of mineral reserves, they typically permit the use of inferred
mineral resources in a scoping study 463 as long as the competent or qualified person provides
appropriate cautionary language regarding the low level of geological confidence in those
resources. Accordingly, a registrant may incur costs if it has obtained a scoping study that would
not be in compliance with the proposed rules because it contains an economic analysis that
includes inferred mineral resources. 464
There is evidence suggesting that investors respond favorably to the disclosures of
mineral resources. For example, the previously discussed study regarding the disclosure of
exploration results also analyzes the announcement returns to disclosures of mineral resources. 465
Analyzing 624 resource announcements by 278 publicly traded Australian firms between 2005
and 2008, the authors document an average abnormal stock return of 2.5% on the announcement
day. As for the exploration results announcements, the abnormal return was calculated relative
to the return on the same day for a size-matched non-announcing commodity peer. Unlike the
463

A scoping study (called a preliminary economic analysis in NI 43-101) is used to determine whether to
proceed with further work leading to preparing a pre-feasibility or feasibility study for mineral reserve
determination. In contrast to our proposed rules, CRIRSCO-based codes allow registrants to disclose results
of scoping studies that use some inferred mineral resources in the economic and technical assessment.

464

See note 155, supra.

465

See Ron Bird, Matthew Grosse, and Danny Yeung (2013), pp. 123-125.

199

announcements of exploration results, the authors find no relation between company size and the
abnormal returns. However, abnormal returns are significantly greater when a mining company
announces mineral resources for the first time. The authors suggest this may be the case because
much of the existing information asymmetry is resolved at the time of the first announcement.
One alternative to the proposed disclosure requirement for mineral resources is not to
require the qualified person to provide an assurance that all issues relating to the relevant
modifying factors can be resolved with further exploration and analysis. Instead, as is required
by the CRIRSCO-based codes, the qualified person could be guided by the definition of mineral
resources provided in the proposed rules in determining that the mineral resources have
“reasonable prospects of economic extraction.” 466 The compliance cost related to preparing an
initial assessment to support mineral resource disclosure associated with this alternative would
likely be lower than the costs associated with the proposed requirement. First, the alternative
would reduce the amount of work that the qualified person has to do to support his or her
determination of resources. In addition, the absence of the requirement to provide the specified
assurance could reduce the qualified person’s potential liability, and as a result, reduce the cost
of engagement of the qualified person. At the same time, this alternative could increase the
uncertainty surrounding the prospects of economic extraction of mineral resources and therefore
reduce the value of the disclosure of such resources.
Another alternative we considered is not to require the preparation of a technical report
summary, as in most CRIRSCO jurisdictions. This alternative would further lower compliance
466

See, e.g., CRIRSCO’s International Reporting Template pt. 21, which states “[t]he term ‘reasonable
prospects for eventual economic extraction’ implies a judgment (albeit preliminary) by the Competent
Person in respect of the technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic
extraction, including the approximate mining parameters.”

200

costs but would also reduce consistency in the disclosures and increase the uncertainty about the
quality of the mineral resources estimates.
5.

Treatment of Mineral Reserves

As discussed above, we propose to revise the definition of mineral reserves to align it
with the CRIRSCO standards by requiring that the qualified person apply defined modifying
factors to the indicated and measured mineral resources in order to convert them to mineral
reserves. The proposed rules would permit either a pre-feasibility or a feasibility study to
provide the basis for determining and reporting mineral reserves. The proposed rules would also
require that the reserve estimations and disclosures thereof be based on the work of a qualified
person. 467
We expect the proposed revisions to the disclosure of mineral reserves to have several
economic benefits. First, the proposed revisions specify in more detail the process that is
required for registrants to convert mineral resources to probable or proven mineral reserves,
including, as noted above, requiring the application and description of relevant modifying factors
that affect the conversion. The increased detail and clarity of the proposed requirements should
lead to more reliable and consistent disclosures. Second, because the determination of mineral
reserves would be based on the analysis and documentation provided by a qualified person, the
disclosure would be associated with the incremental benefits potentially stemming from the
qualified person requirement, as discussed above. Third, the staff currently requests that
registrants obtain a full feasibility study to support the determination of mineral reserves, but the
proposed rules would allow, under certain conditions, the use of a pre-feasibility study, thus
467

See section II.F, supra.

201

reducing compliance costs relative to current practice. This benefit is likely to be more
significant for smaller, capital-constrained registrants since the cost of feasibility studies is
positively related to the size of individual projects rather than the size of the registrant.
Pre-feasibility studies, while adequate for disclosure of mineral reserves, require less time
than feasibility studies. For example, one study estimates that between 12% and 15% of the
engineering work on a project is completed by the end of the pre-feasibility study compared to
between 18% and 25% at the end of the feasibility study. 468 Thus, assuming the same cost per
worker-hour, a pre-feasibility study will be around 33-40% less costly than a feasibility study.
Allowing pre-feasibility studies would be especially beneficial for registrants that already have
studies meeting the pre-feasibility standard, but not the feasibility standard.
In addition to compliance cost savings, allowing the use of pre-feasibility studies could
provide several ancillary benefits for registrants and investors. Because CRIRSCO-based
disclosure codes already allow the use of pre-feasibility studies, allowing their use under the
proposed rules would place U.S and non-Canadian foreign registrants on equal footing with
Canadian registrants availing themselves of the “foreign or state law” exception and other
mining companies reporting only in CRIRSCO jurisdictions. Finally, the proposed detailed
requirements for feasibility studies should reduce compliance uncertainty, while increasing
consistency in disclosures where feasibility studies are used to determine mineral reserves.
Because the proposed treatment of mineral reserves is consistent with established best
practices in the mining industry, we do not expect a significant increase in compliance costs
beyond the potential cost increases related to the qualified person requirement and the filing of
468

See Richard L. Bullock, “Mineral Property Feasibility Studies,” in 1 SME Mining Engineering Handbook,
supra note115, at 227−261.

202

the technical report summary, as discussed above. Given the potentially large compliance cost
savings associated with allowing pre-feasibility studies, we expect most registrants to experience
an overall reduction in compliance costs. However, because a pre-feasibility study is typically
associated with a lower confidence level than a feasibility study, allowing the use of prefeasibility studies would likely lead to higher uncertainty associated with the mineral reserve
disclosures. This increased uncertainty should be mitigated by the proposed qualified person
requirement and proposed requirement of a final feasibility study in certain specified high risk
situations.
One reasonable alternative to the proposed rules would be to require feasibility studies by
a qualified person and not allow pre-feasibility studies. This alternative could lead to less
uncertainty surrounding mineral reserve estimates but would be associated with significantly
higher compliance costs than the proposed revisions. Moreover, this alternative would continue
to place U.S. and non-Canadian registrants at a competitive disadvantage.
6.

The Pricing Model for Determination of Mineral Resources and
Reserves

As discussed above, Guide 7 does not include a specific pricing model for the estimation
of mineral reserves. Currently, registrants generally use a commodity price that is no higher than
the trailing 3-year average price. The proposed disclosure requirements for mineral resources
and mineral reserves would require registrants to use in their reserve and resource estimations a
commodity price that is no higher than the average closing price during the 24-month period
prior to the end of the last fiscal year, with the exception that registrants can use a higher price if
set by contractual arrangements.
A key consideration when deciding on a pricing model is that a price is assigned to
203

mineral material that is in the ground and likely will not be extracted for many years. Ideally,
our rules would use a pricing model that could accurately predict what prices will be at the time
of future expected extraction. Given that commodity prices are volatile and generally difficult to
predict, there is no established industry “best practice” model. Absent an established industry
standard for the pricing model, we believe that, for the purpose of public disclosure, the pricing
model should be transparent and cost effective, while producing unbiased estimates of future
prices and promoting comparability of estimated resources and reserves across registrants. At
the same time, given the inherent difficulty of forecasting future commodity prices and the
segmented nature of the markets for some of the minerals involved, we also believe that the
pricing model should provide registrants with some flexibility to draw on their knowledge and
experience. However, we recognize that allowing firms to use their internal pricing models may
hurt comparability and may create incentives to use unrealistically high prices that result in
overestimated mineral resources and reserves.
A ceiling price model based on a trailing average, like the 3-year trailing average price
used as a ceiling in the current staff guidance, strikes a balance between the objectives outlined
above. First, the ceiling price itself is transparent, easy to calculate, and consistent for any given
commodity and time, thus promoting comparability across registrants. Second, because the
trailing average price is a ceiling, it gives registrants some flexibility to use their own preferred
pricing model as long as it does not exceed the ceiling. Third, any tendency by registrants to
select overly optimistic prices in an attempt to inflate estimates is mitigated by the ceiling price,
which prevents registrants from assigning a price that is greater than what has been observed
over the time period of the trailing average.
We believe that the proposed rules, which use a shorter time to calculate the historic
204

average price than current practice, would result in a ceiling price that is more sensitive to shifts
in price trends and therefore would be more relevant for estimating the inherent value of mineral
resources and reserves. We also believe that the 24-month time period is preferable to using a
shorter time period. An average price determined over, for example, a one-year period could be
affected by short-term price volatility in such a way that the value of the estimated resources and
reserves could reflect more short-term market conditions than long-term fundamental market
factors. The proposed 24-month period intends to strike a balance between the ceiling price
being sensitive to recent changes in fundamental market conditions while avoiding introducing
fluctuations in the ceiling price that may be driven more by short-term price volatility than by
changes in fundamental market conditions. 469
In practice, if the price that many mining registrants currently use to estimate resources
and reserves is at or below the 24-month average closing price, the proposed rules would not
significantly impact compliance costs for these registrants. 470 To the extent that the price that
management is using is above the 24-month average, however, there would be a potential
significant cost to registrants to recalculate mineral resource and reserve estimates in compliance

469

To illustrate the differences in the volatility depending on the time horizon used for the ceiling price, staff
analysis shows that for copper prices on the London Metal Exchange over the 1986-2015 time period, the
standard deviation of the percentage change in year-over-year prices was 16.6%, 20.0%, and 25.9% for
average prices calculated based on horizons of 36 months, 24 months, and 12 months, respectively. This
can be compared to the standard deviation of the year-over-year change in daily prices, which was 34.1%.
A qualitatively similar pattern was found for a wide variety of different minerals. (Note that for these
calculations, end of the month prices were used to calculate the year-over-year changes for each of the
different price alternatives, which means that the standard deviations are based on 360 observations of
year-to-year percentage changes for each time horizon). The data used for the analysis was collected from
Thomson Reuters Markets LLC’s DataStream database.

470

The only costs would be to calculate the 24 month average price and determine whether the price that
management currently uses to estimate its mineral resources and reserves is below that price.

205

with the proposed rules. 471
We recognize that because the proposed ceiling price model is a trailing average of
historical prices, the ceiling price by design may be slow to incorporate recent price trends.
Thus, to the extent that a recent significant trend in prices marks a true structural break towards
higher (lower) commodity prices on the long run, the proposed ceiling price may result in
underestimation (overestimation) of mineral reserves and resources. It is worth noting that, to
mitigate the risk that the ceiling price does not appropriately reflect recent changes in the
fundamental market conditions, the proposed rules would allow registrants that have contracts
with prices that are higher than the ceiling to use such prices. Moreover, the proposed rules
would require disclosure of the assumptions used in the economic analysis underlying the
estimates of mineral resources and reserves, including the price chosen, if the registrant has not
previously disclosed mineral reserve or resource estimates in a filing with the Commission or is
disclosing material changes to its previously disclosed mineral reserve or resource estimates. 472
The overall economic effects of the proposed pricing model are particularly difficult to quantify,
and we request comment on these effects.
There are several reasonable alternatives to the proposed pricing model. One alternative
would be the approach followed by several foreign jurisdictions with CRIRSCO-based codes,
where the qualified person is allowed to use any reasonable and justifiable price based on that
471

These costs would vary significantly depending on the facts and circumstances, including the type of
deposit, mining methods, and magnitude of price change. In some instances, a price change may require
very little additional engineering and economic analysis to determine the economic viability of the mineral
resources in question. In other instances, a price change may lead to a significant change in the scale of the
proposed mining project. The qualified person would then have to repeat almost all the engineering and
economic analysis to determine mineral resources.

472

See proposed Item 1304(b)(9) of Regulation S-K.

206

qualified person’s or management’s view of long-term market trends. 473 Compared to the
proposed price ceiling model, this alternative approach would reduce the risk of underestimation
of mineral reserves and resources following a fundamental upward shift in the commodity price,
but would also carry a higher risk of overestimation. A modified version of this alternative
would be to require registrants also to provide a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of mineral
resources and reserves with respect to the commodity price used, where the price points used in
the sensitivity analysis surrounding the base price would be selected by the registrant. A
sensitivity analysis with respect to price would help investors better assess the risk associated
with the estimated mineral resources and reserves and could, therefore, lead to more efficient
investment decisions. However, because a sensitivity analysis would require registrants to
calculate at least three estimates of resources and reserves (the base price, as well as one price
each above and below the base price, respectively), compliance costs would be increased. These
compliance costs would be mitigated to the extent that registrants are able to use estimates based
on existing calculations from an internal sensitivity analysis.
A second alternative would be to calculate the ceiling price differently, for example, as
spot, forward, or futures price as of the end of the last fiscal year to incorporate more quickly
shifts in price trends. However, due to the volatility associated with prices from any given
specific day, the disclosed estimates of mineral resources and reserves may fluctuate more than
the underlying fundamental values of the resources and reserves, thus increasing the uncertainty
of the estimates for investors. Moreover, to the extent the ceiling price calculated using this
alternative is below the price that registrants use based upon their own internal calculations, the

473

See note 196, supra.

207

higher volatility of this alternative ceiling price may create higher compliance costs as registrants
may have to provide more frequent recalculations of their mineral resources and reserves, solely
for the purpose of their SEC filings.
A third alternative would be to require registrants to estimate mineral resources and
reserves using a price no higher than the 24-month trailing average price and allow registrants to
also disclose mineral resources and reserves based on a higher price of their own choosing, to the
extent that they include a description of the model and assumptions used to select the price. 474
This approach would present standardized estimates that are transparent and comparable across
registrants, while letting managers present supplement estimates based on an alternative price if
they, for example, believe that the 24-month average may lead to inaccurate estimates. Because
reporting a second set of estimates based on prices higher than the ceiling price would be
voluntary, presumably registrants only would provide such alternative estimates if they expect
the benefits of doing so to outweigh the costs. The potential cost of this alternative is that the
price ceiling mechanism would lose its ability to constrain disclosure of overestimated mineral
resources and mineral reserves due to the use of overly optimistic prices, which is one of the
objectives for the price model discussed above.
7.

Specific Disclosure Requirements
i.

Requirements for Summary Disclosure

Currently, Guide 7 does not explicitly address what disclosure should be provided when a
registrant has multiple mining properties. Instead, on a filing-by-filing basis, staff has not
objected to a registrant with multiple mining properties providing summary disclosure that
474

As currently proposed, a registrant would not be permitted to provide a supplemental mineral reserve
determination (i.e., estimate based upon prices higher than the 24 month trailing average). See note 252,
supra.

208

encompasses all of its properties instead of providing disclosure on a property by property basis.
The proposed rules would require that registrants that own multiple mining properties provide
summary disclosure of their mining operations. The summary disclosure would include maps of
the locations of all mining properties, a tabular presentation of certain material information about
the 20 properties with the largest asset values, and a summary of all mineral resources and
reserves at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. 475
We expect that the proposed summary disclosure would help registrants to convey more
effectively to investors information about their aggregate mining properties and operations.
Because of the clarity and detail in the proposed summary requirement, it should also reduce
compliance uncertainty and increase consistency of summary disclosures across registrants.
These benefits should be particularly important for registrants with a diverse set of mining
properties. 476
Given that the proposed requirement for summary disclosure would align with what most
registrants already provide in their SEC filings, we do not expect the requirement to impose
significant additional costs on registrants with mining operations that are material in the
aggregate, but have no individual property that is material. We also note that one CRIRSCObased jurisdiction, Australia, through the ASX listing rules, requires summary disclosure similar
to the proposed summary disclosure requirements. 477 For registrants that do not already provide
summary disclosure, whether reporting pursuant to Guide 7 or under any of the CRIRSCO-based
codes, other than the ASX listing rules, there could be additional costs to comply with the
475

See the discussion in Section II.G.1., supra.

476

See section II.B. 2, supra.

477

See ASX Listing Rules 5.1.2 and 5.3.2.

209

summary disclosure requirements in addition to any individual property disclosure requirements.
One alternative to the proposed summary disclosure would be to limit the disclosure
required by proposed Item 1303(b)(3) to only the mineral resources and reserves for the 20
largest properties, rather than for all mining operations. This would reduce compliance costs for
registrants with greater than 20 mining properties. The cost of this alternative would be a
potentially significant reduction in the information about mineral resources and reserves
available to investors by excluding such information for many properties, which could be a
significant portion or majority of the registrant’s mineral resources and reserves. This reduction
in information would be particularly significant for registrants with multiple properties where no
individual property is material.
Another alternative would be to require summary information about the mining
operations in aggregate but not for any individual property. Compared to the proposed
requirements, this alternative would lower not only compliance costs but also the amount of
information available to investors, especially when the registrant has material mining operations
in aggregate but no individual mining property that is material.
The required summary disclosures would increase the accessibility of the information to
investors and other data users. The proposed tabular formats (Tables 2 and 3), however, may not
be readily machine-readable or directly comparable across filers without additional structure. An
alternative to the proposed summary requirements would be also to require the disclosure
required in Tables 2 and 3 to be made available in a structured data format, such as eXtensible
Business Reporting Language (XBRL). When registrants provide disclosure items in a
structured data format, investors and other data users (e.g., analysts) can more easily retrieve and
use the information reported by registrants and perform comparisons of common disclosures
210

across registrants and reporting periods. 478 Investors can download information directly into
spreadsheets or statistical analysis software, which eliminates the need to enter the information
manually and minimizes the time burden and risk of errors associated with data entry. The
structuring of the data would require the development of a taxonomy (a standard list of tags
necessary for reporting in XBRL), which in turn would require some level of standardization of
the various data elements based on mining industry practices. To the extent that the proposed
rules permit tailoring of the disclosures in Tables 2 and 3 to registrants’ unique circumstances
and provide filers with the flexibility in how to report the required information, the comparability
of the data across registrants would be decreased, which in turn would decrease the usefulness of
requiring the data in Tables 2 and 3 to be made available in the XBRL format.
A company may choose to tag its own disclosures in-house or to outsource the tagging
process. Whether structured data filings are prepared in-house or by an outside service provider,
registrants would incur additional costs to make the disclosure available in a structured data
format, including initial set-up costs and ongoing costs. To the extent that such costs have a
fixed component, they could impose a relatively greater burden on smaller registrants.
ii.

Requirements for Individual Property Disclosure

As discussed above, the proposed requirements for individual property disclosure for
material properties would standardize the current policies and requirements in Guide 7, Item 102
of Regulation S-K, and Form 20-F, including a requirement that registrants present most of the
disclosure in tabular format. The proposed requirements would also increase the amount and
type of individual property information that registrants disclose. Much of this new information
478

See Release No. 33-9002A (Apr. 1, 2009) [74 FR 15666] (“Financial Statement Information Adopting
Release”).

211

would be a direct consequence of the proposed new requirements to disclose material exploration
results and mineral resources. Another new item of information would be the required
comparison of a registrant’s mineral resources and reserves as of the end of the last fiscal year
against the mineral resources and reserves as of the end of the preceding fiscal year, with an
explanation of any change between the two.
The standardizations of the proposed format for disclosures relative to the current
disclosure regime should increase the effectiveness of the information conveyed to investors.
The comparative year-to-year disclosure requirement should also help investors better
understand the risk and prospects of the registrants’ mining operations.
We expect that the tabular format of some of the individual property requirements could
initially result in additional compliance costs. However, we expect that ultimately the costs for
the disclosure of a registrant’s mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration
results may decline over time because companies should only have to incur the costs to update
their systems and procedures to collect and structure the required information once, and
thereafter will only have to update the reported information. The remainder of the individual
property disclosure requirements should not increase costs to registrants since they are
substantially similar to those currently provided under the existing disclosure regime. 479
Similar to the above discussed requirement for summary disclosure, an alternative to the
proposed requirements for individual property disclosure would be to require the disclosures in
Tables 4 to 8 to be made available in XBRL format. This alternative would have the same

479

The costs we consider in this subsection are only the costs related to the format of the individual property
disclosure requirements, as costs related to the proposed expansion of information required to be disclosed
are discussed in preceding sections.

212

potential benefits and costs as those discussed above in Section IV.B.7.i.
iii.

Requirements for Technical Report Summaries

We expect that the proposed technical report summary requirement would have the
largest impact on registrants’ compliance costs since currently only registrants from Canada and
Australia are subject to a similar requirement. 480 The proposed requirements for the technical
report summaries are largely consistent with the items of information required under the
Canadian NI 43-101 standards, with some relevant differences. One important difference is that
NI 43-101 allows the qualified person to include a disclaimer of responsibility if he or she relies
on a report, opinion, or statement of another expert who is not a qualified person in preparing the
technical report summary, while the proposed requirement would not allow such a disclaimer.
The potential benefit of not allowing such a disclaimer is that it would give the qualified person,
as a consenting expert, greater incentive to verify information included in the technical report
that is provided by others. However, the resulting increase in legal liability could also raise the
cost of hiring a qualified person. 481
iv.

Requirements for Internal Controls Disclosure

The proposed requirement that a registrant describe the internal controls that it uses in the
disclosure of its exploration results and in its estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves
would align the Commission’s disclosure regime with the requirements of the CRIRSCO-based
codes. Current rules and guidance do not address internal controls. Commission staff has, on a
480

We estimate that 113 out of the 345 existing mining registrants are currently also reporting in Canada or
Australia.

481

As discussed in Section II.F.3 above, other differences from NI 43-101 in the proposed requirement
concern the structure of how certain types of information are presented, which we believe would enhance
the presentation of the information without any significant impact on compliance costs relative to NI 43101.

213

case-by-case basis when warranted by the specific facts and circumstances, requested a brief
description of the quality control and quality assurance protocols used for exploration plans.
We expect disclosure of the internal controls that a registrant uses to improve
significantly investors’ understanding of the risks related to the quality and reliability of a
registrant’s disclosure of exploration results and estimates of mineral resources and mineral
reserves, and therefore also lead to more efficient investment decisions. We also expect the
requirement to increase compliance costs for registrants. Registrants already disclosing internal
controls in CRIRSCO jurisdictions or voluntarily providing such disclosures in their SEC filings
should be largely unaffected by the proposed requirements.
8.

Conforming Changes to Certain Forms Not Subject to Regulation S-K
i.

Form 20-F

The proposed conforming changes to Form 20-F are intended to ensure consistency in the
mining disclosures across both domestic registrants and foreign private issuers (excluding
Canadian 40-F filers). The proposed changes would particularly affect Canadian registrants that
report pursuant to Form 20-F and are currently permitted to provide additional mining disclosure
under NI 43-101 pursuant to the “foreign or state law” exception under Guide 7 and the “foreign
law” exception under Form 20-F. The proposed rules would eliminate this exception and may
thus increase compliance costs for these registrants to the extent that, as discussed previously, the
proposed disclosure requirements differ from NI 43-101. 482 That said, to the extent that these

482

Although the disclosure requirements of the proposed rules are similar to those in NI 43-101, there are
some differences that may impose additional costs. For example, the requirements in the proposed rules
concerning how to determine prices for mineral reserve estimates are different from those in NI 43-101. In
addition, the proposed rules require that the qualified person conduct a preliminary evaluation of the
relevant modifying factors to establish the prospects of economic extraction in estimating resources, which
NI 43-101 does not.

214

differences in disclosure requirements also provide expected incremental benefits, these benefits
would mitigate any increase in compliance costs.
ii.

Form 1-A

The proposed conforming changes to Form 1-A would subject Regulation A issuers with
material mining operations to the full mining disclosure requirements in the proposed subpart
1300 of Regulation S-K. Thus, these issuers may incur the benefits and costs of these
requirements, as previously discussed. Because Regulation A issuers are typically smaller
companies, the economic considerations discussed above about smaller companies would apply
to this group of issuers. In general, we expect that the proposed rules would benefit Regulation
A issuers given that smaller companies typically suffer a higher degree of information
asymmetry between the company and investors, which may increase capital costs and lower
access to financing. Nevertheless, the expected increase in compliance costs from the proposed
mining disclosures requirements may be of particular importance for mining issuers that are
likely to consider Regulation A offerings. Under the proposed requirements, mining issuers
would be able to avoid the costs associated with the prescribed technical reports by forgoing
disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources, and reserves, as defined, which would
mitigate any negative effect of increased compliance costs on the propensity to use a Regulation
A offering. Mining issuers may also be able to avoid costs by choosing to offer securities under
other exemptions under the Securities Act, such as Regulation D. However, this may put such
issuers at a competitive disadvantage relative to their peers who are raising capital with the
benefit of these disclosures.
One alternative to the proposed conforming changes to Form 1-A would be to require the
proposed mining disclosures for Tier 2 offerings only. Because Tier 2 offerings may be larger
215

than Tier 1 offerings, the relative importance of fixed compliance costs could be lower for Tier 2
issuers, and thus the net benefit to Tier 2 issuers from the disclosure requirements could
potentially be larger. Another alternative we considered would be to require disclosure only of
the information in the proposed summary disclosure requirement discussed in Section II.F,
including for issuers that only own one material mining property. This would lower compliance
costs, but would also reduce the information to investors about material mining properties.
9.

Compliance Costs of Preparing and Filing Forms

The most significant compliance costs associated with the proposed rules for mining
disclosure would likely be the costs associated with engaging qualified persons and the technical
analyses and reports they prepare. Registrants would also incur direct compliance costs from the
proposed rules related to preparing and incorporating the required information in relevant
Commission forms. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, we analyze these costs in
more detail in Section V, but for the average firm, we expect an increase of 44.64 internal
company burden hours and an increase of costs for outside professionals equal to $11,975. 483 As
we discuss in Section V, we expect the incremental company burden hours and professional
costs would be lower than these estimates for registrants subject to CRIRSCO-based codes and
larger for registrants not subject to such codes. Moreover, the incremental burden and costs
would likely vary with the size and complexity of the registrant’s mining operations.
C.

Anticipated Impact on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

We expect the proposed disclosure requirements to increase the amount and quality of
483

The average increase in internal burden hours and outside professional costs are calculated using the
estimates of total incremental company burden hours (15,400) and total incremental professional costs
($4,131,200), as reported in Table 2 of Section V.D, supra, and dividing them by the estimated number of
total annual responses (345).

216

disclosed information about registrants’ mining operations, and thereby to have a positive effect
on efficiency and capital formation. For example, the proposed rules would require registrants
with material mining operations to disclose determined mineral reserves, mineral resources and
material exploration results. These proposed requirements would better align the Commission’s
disclosure requirements with the current practices used by mining companies to evaluate their
projects, thereby reducing information asymmetries between registrants and investors about the
prospects of mining operations. In addition, the qualified person requirement, together with
detailed requirements for the supporting technical studies, should generate higher quality and
more consistent disclosures, which should reduce any uncertainty surrounding the disclosures.
In turn, reduced information asymmetries and reduced uncertainty about the disclosures would
help investors achieve a more efficient capital allocation, while reducing the cost of capital and
enhancing capital formation for registrants. 484
In particular, we believe that the proposed requirements for disclosure of material
exploration results and mineral resources would reduce information asymmetries and uncertainty
for smaller mining registrants, as these registrants tend to have mining properties in earlier stages
of development with relatively fewer reported mineral reserves. As a result, we expect the
anticipated positive effects on efficiency and capital formation to be relatively larger for smaller

484

The significant risk and negative impact on capital formation from uncertainty surrounding mining
disclosure is illustrated by the evidence in William O. Brown, Jr. and Richard C.K. Burdekin, "Fraud and
Financial Markets: The 1997 Collapse of the Junior mining Stocks” (2000), Journal of Economics and
Business, Volume 52, Issue 3, pp. 277-288. The authors utilize event study methodology to analyze the
effect on Canadian mining companies’ stock returns around the revelations in spring 1997 of fraudulent
disclosures of gold resources by the Canadian mining company Bre-X. The study documents that a
portfolio of 59 Canadian gold mining stocks experienced significantly negative abnormal stock returns
around the Bre-X fraud revelations. Similarly, the Vancouver Composite Index, which at the time was
dominated by natural resource companies, also experienced significantly negative abnormal returns for the
same event time period. We note that the Bre-X fraud contributed to the development of the Canadian NI
43-101 mining disclosure standards.

217

registrants. However, these effects would only materialize to the extent smaller registrants make
the required investment in the studies that are required to support disclosure in the first place.
We anticipate that there likely are some smaller registrants who do not have access to the liquid
funds needed to make that investment.
Although we expect the overall amount of disclosed information to increase under the
proposed rules, there may be exceptions. As discussed previously, we expect that the proposed
disclosure requirements would increase the compliance costs for disclosure of material
exploration results and the currently allowed (on a case-by-case basis) equivalent of mineral
resources (i.e., mineralized material). Therefore, despite the anticipated benefits from the
proposed disclosure requirements, some registrants may find that these benefits do not outweigh
the compliance costs and reduce what they disclose currently.
The positive effects we expect on efficiency and capital formation from the proposed
rules would be lower for the registrants that currently report in foreign jurisdictions with
CRIRSCO-based disclosure codes. These registrants to a large degree already provide the
proposed disclosures. This is particularly the case for Canadian registrants, who disclose the
information pursuant to NI 43-101 standards in their Forms 20-F under the “foreign or state law”
exception.
We expect the proposed rules to have some competitive effects. For example, there may
be reallocation of capital as registrants that previously could not disclose mineral resources or
could not afford the feasibility studies required for disclosure of mineral reserves (but could
afford pre-feasibility studies) may start to disclose a broader range of their business prospects,
making it easier for these registrants to raise capital and compete with the mining companies that
already report material mineral resources and reserves. We also anticipate that by aligning our
218

disclosure requirements with the CRIRSCO-based codes, the proposed rules would improve the
competitiveness of U.S. securities markets and increase the likelihood of prospective registrants
listing their securities in the United States, while decreasing the likelihood that current registrants
would exit U.S. markets. 485 In particular the qualified person requirement and associated
requirements for the supporting technical studies may improve the global competiveness of U.S.
registrants because such quality assurances have become internationally recognized practice and
may help signal to market participants that U.S. registrants are able to meet the standards
codified by the proposed rules.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the costs and benefits described throughout this release. We
seek estimates of these costs and benefits, as well as any costs and benefits not already identified,
that may result from the adoption of the proposed rules. We also request qualitative feedback on
the nature of the economic effects, including the benefits and costs, we have identified and any
benefits and costs we may have overlooked. We request comment from the point of view of
registrants, investors, mining professionals such as geologists and engineers, and other market
participants. We further seek information that would help us quantify or otherwise qualitatively
assess the impact of the proposed rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In
addition, we seek information on how any impact on efficiency, competition, and capital

485

There could be an opposite effect in some cases. Among foreign private issuers, the registrants not
currently reporting in foreign jurisdictions based on CRIRSCO standards are most likely to experience an
increase in compliance costs. If these compliance costs become too burdensome, some of these foreign
private issuers may choose to withdraw from U.S securities markets. The impact of such a potential
outcome is limited, however, as we have only identified seven (as of December 2015) foreign private
issuers that are not subject to CRIRSCO reporting standards. Moreover, a company that did not want to
comply with these or similar disclosure standards would only have a limited number of alternative
jurisdictions to list, none of whose markets are as developed or robust as the U.S. or other financial markets
that have such standards.

219

formation would vary with company size.
In particular, we request comment on the following:
124. We seek comment and data on the magnitude of the costs and benefits identified as well
as any other costs and benefits that may result from the adoption of the proposed rules.
In addition, we are interested in views regarding these costs and benefits for particular
types of covered registrants, such as smaller registrants or registrants currently reporting
according to CRIRSCO-based disclosure codes.
125. We seek information that would help us quantify compliance costs. In particular, we
invite comment from registrants or other mining companies that have had experience
reporting under any of the CRIRSCO-based disclosure codes. For example, what are the
costs associated with the qualified person requirement? If reporting in Canada or
Australia, what are the costs associated with producing and filing the technical report
summaries?
126. We invite comment on the structure of compliance costs. In particular, to what extent
are the compliance costs fixed versus variable? Are there scale advantages or
disadvantages in the compliance costs, both in terms of project size or company size?
127. Are our estimates of the difference in costs of a pre-feasibility study relative to a
feasibility study reasonable? If not, what would be more reasonable estimates of the
difference in costs?
128. We also seek comment on the alternatives to the proposed rules discussed in this
section, and to the costs and benefits of each alternative. Are there any other
alternatives that we should consider in lieu of the proposed rules? If so, what are those
alternatives and what are their expected costs and benefits?
220

129. We are interested in comments and data related to any potential competitive effects
from the proposed rules. In particular, we are interested in evidence and views on the
current global competitive situation of U.S. mining registrants as well as the
attractiveness of U.S. securities markets for foreign mining companies. To what extent
does the current mining disclosure regime affect this competitive situation, if at all?
Would the proposed rules improve the global competitiveness of U.S. mining
registrants and securities markets? If so, how?

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A.

Background

Certain provisions of the proposed rules contain “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 486 The
Commission is submitting the proposed rules to the Office of Management and Budget
(“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA. 487 The titles for the collections of
information are:
•

“Regulation S-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-007); 488

•

“Form S-1” (OMB Control No. 3235-0065);

•

“Form S-4” (OMB Control Number 3235-0324);

487

44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.

488

The paperwork burden from Regulation S-K is imposed through the forms that are subject to the
requirements in that regulation and is reflected in the analysis of those forms. To avoid a Paperwork
Reduction Act inventory reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative convenience, we assign a
one-hour burden to Regulation S-K.

•

“Form 20-F” (OMB Control No. 3235-0063); and

•

Regulation A (Form 1-A) (OMB Control Number 3235-0286).

We adopted Regulation S-K and these forms pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act. Regulation S-K and the forms, other than Form 1-A, set forth the disclosure
requirements for annual reports and registration statements that are prepared by registrants to
provide investors with the information they need to make informed investment decisions in
registered offerings and in secondary market transactions. We adopted Regulation A to provide
an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offerings that satisfy certain
conditions, such as filing an offering statement with the Commission on Form 1-A, limiting the
dollar amount of the offering and, in certain instances, filing ongoing reports with the
Commission.
The hours and costs associated with preparing and filing the forms constitute reporting
and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. An agency may not conduct or
sponsor, and a person is not required to comply with, a collection of information unless it
displays a currently valid control number. Compliance with the proposed rules would be
mandatory. Responses to the information collections would not be kept confidential, and there
would be no mandatory retention period for the information disclosed.
B.

Summary of Collection of Information Requirements

The proposed rules would require a registrant with material mining operations to disclose
its determined mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration results in Securities
222

Act registration statements filed on Forms S-1, S-4, F-1 and F-4, in Exchange Act registration
statements on Forms 10 and 20-F, in Exchange Act annual reports on Forms 10-K and 20-F, 489
and in Regulation A offering statements filed on Form 1-A. The proposed rules would further
require that such a registrant base its disclosure regarding mineral resources, mineral reserves
and material exploration results in SEC filings on information and supporting documentation by
a qualified person. In addition, the proposed rules would require a registrant with material
mining operations to file as an exhibit to its Securities Act registration statement, Exchange Act
registration statement or report, or its Form 1-A offering statement, a technical report summary
prepared by the qualified person for each material property that summarizes the information and
supporting documentation forming the basis of the registrant’s disclosure in the SEC form. The
proposed rules would require the filing of the technical report summary when the registrant first
reports mineral resources, mineral reserves or material exploration results or when it reports a
material change in a prior disclosure of resources, reserves or exploration results.
The Commission’s existing disclosure regime for mining registrants precludes the
disclosure of non-reserves, such as mineral resources, unless such disclosure is required by
foreign or state law. 490 In addition, the existing regime permits, but does not require, the
disclosure of material exploration results. The existing regime also does not currently require a

489

Form 20-F is the form used by a foreign private issuer to file either a registration statement or annual report
under the Exchange Act. Because the proposed rule amendments would impose the same substantive
requirements for a registration statement and annual report filed under Form 20-F, we have not separately
allocated the estimated reporting and cost burdens for a Form 20-F registration statement and Form 20-F
annual report.

490

Because only Canada has adopted its mining code as a matter of law, the disclosure of non-reserves in SEC
filings has been limited to Canadian registrants.

223

registrant to base its mining disclosure on information and supporting documentation of a
qualified person.
Accordingly, we expect the proposed rules would cause an increase in the reporting and
cost burdens for each collection of information. The additional requirements imposed by the
proposed rules would, however, be similar to requirements under foreign (CRIRSCO-based)
mining codes. As such, we expect the increase in reporting and cost burdens to be less for those
registrants that are already subject to the CRIRSCO standards. Nevertheless, because there are
differences between the proposed rules’ requirements and those under the CRIRSCO-based
codes, we expect there would be some increase in reporting and cost burdens even for those
registrants already subject to foreign mining code requirements. 491
C.

Estimate of Potentially Affected Registrants

We estimate the number of registrants potentially affected by the proposed rules to be
345. 492 Of these registrants, we estimate that 129 are already subject to the disclosure
requirements under one or more CRIRSCO-based codes and, therefore, likely would incur a
lesser increase in reporting and cost burdens to comply with the proposed rules’
requirements. 493 Accordingly, we estimate that 216 registrants would bear the full paperwork
burden of the proposed rules.

491

For example, unlike the CRIRSCO-based codes, the proposed rules would require a particular type of
technical study, an “initial assessment,” to support the disclosure of mineral resources in SEC filings. See
section II.E.3, supra.

492

We have based this estimate on the number of registrants with mining operations that filed the above
described Securities Act and Exchange Act forms from January 2014 through December 2015.

493

Most of these registrants are subject to the disclosure requirements in Canada’s NI 43-101.

224

The following table summarizes the number of potentially affected registrants by the
particular form expected to be filed and whether the registrant is subject to CRIRSCO-based
code requirements in addition to the proposed rules.

Estimate of Reporting and Cost Burdens

We have estimated the reporting and cost burdens of the proposed rules by estimating
the average number of hours it would take a registrant to prepare, review and file the disclosure
required by the proposed rules for each collection of information. In deriving our estimates, we
recognize that the burdens would likely vary among individual registrants based on a number of
factors, including the size and complexity of their mining operations. The estimates represent
the average burden for all registrants, both large and small.
We believe that the resulting increase in reporting and cost burdens would be
substantially the same for each collection of information since the proposed rules would require
substantially the same disclosure for a Securities Act registration statement or Regulation A
offering statement as they would for an Exchange Act registration statement or report. The sole
225

difference between the proposed rules’ effect on Securities Act registrants and Form 1-A
issuers, on the one hand, and Exchange Act registrants, on the other, is that a Securities Act
registrant and a Regulation A issuer would be required to obtain and file as an exhibit the
written consent of each qualified person whose information and supporting documentation as an
expert provide the basis for the disclosure required under the amendments. 494 To account for
this difference, we have allocated one extra hour to the reporting burdens estimated for the
Securities Act registration statement forms and Regulation A’s Form 1-A.
We estimate that the proposed rules would cause a registrant that is not already subject
to CRIRSCO requirements to incur an increase of 96 hours in the reporting burden for each
Securities Act registration statement (Forms S-1, S-4, F-1, and F-4), and an increase of 95 hours
in the reporting burden for each Exchange Act registration statement or annual report (Forms
10, 10-K and 20-F.) For a registrant that is subject to the CRIRSCO requirements, we estimate
that the proposed rules would cause an increase of 41 hours in the reporting burden for
Securities Act registration statements and Form 1-A offering statements, and an increase of 40
hours in the reporting burden for Exchange Act registration statements and annual reports.
We have based our estimated burden hours and costs under the proposed rules on an
assessment by the Commission’s staff mining engineers of the work required to prepare the
required information for disclosure. In particular, our estimates have been based on the staff
engineers’ assessment of similar reporting requirements under CRIRSCO standards (especially

494

A Securities Act registrant must file the written consent of an expert upon which it has relied pursuant to
Securities Act Rule 436 (17 CFR 230.436). A Regulation A issuer’s obligation to file the written consent
of an expert is based on Item 17(11)(a) of Form 1-A.

226

Canada’s NI 43-101 and Australia’s JORC). 495 The engineers’ estimates of time and costs for
NI 43-101 and JORC reporting were adjusted for the differences between the proposed rules
and those standards.
The following tables summarize, respectively, the estimated incremental and total
reporting costs and burdens resulting from the proposed rules. When determining these
estimates, for all forms other than Form 10-K and Form 1-A, we have assumed that 25% of the
burden of preparation is carried by the registrant internally and 75% of the burden of
preparation is carried by outside professionals retained by the registrant at an average cost of
$400 per hour. 496 For Form 10-K and Form 1-A, we have assumed that 75% of the burden of
preparation is carried by the registrant internally and 25% of the burden of preparation is carried
by outside professionals at an average cost of $400 per hour. The portion of the burden carried
by outside professionals is reflected as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried by the
registrant internally is reflected in hours.
We have determined the estimated total incremental registrant burden hours for each
form under the proposed rules by first determining the hour burden per registrant response
estimated as a weighted average of the burden hours of registrants subject to and those not

495

These estimates include the burden associated with preparing a technical report summary to support the
disclosure of mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration results. For purposes of this
PRA analysis, we estimate that registrants subject to the CRIRSCO standards would each incur 11 hours,
and registrants not subject to those standards would each incur 50 hours, to prepare the required technical
report summary.

496

We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the
professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis we estimate that such costs would be an
average of $400 per hour. This is the rate we typically estimate for outside services used in connection
with public company reporting.

227

subject to the CRIRSCO requirements. 497 We then multiplied this average burden hour per
response by the total number of responses for each form estimated to occur annually. We
similarly estimated the incremental professional costs for each form under the proposed rules by
first estimating the incremental professional costs as a weighted average of the incremental
professional costs estimated to be incurred by registrants subject and not subject to the
CRIRSCO requirements. We then multiplied the average incremental professional costs by the
total number of annual responses estimated to occur for each form. 498
Based on these calculations, as set forth below, we estimate that the total number of
incremental burden hours for all forms resulting from complying with the proposed rules is
15,400 burden hours. We further estimate that the resulting total incremental professional costs
for all forms under the proposed rules is $4,131,200. 499
PRA TABLE 2: ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL BURDEN AND COSTS UNDER THE PROPOSED
RULES

497

For example, we determined the estimated incremental burden hours for Form S-1 as follows: 41 hours ×
0.25 = 10.25 internal burden hours for CRIRSCO filers; 10.25 hours × 7 = 71.75 total incremental hours for
CRIRSCO filers. 96 hours × 0.25 = 24 internal burden hours for non-CRIRSCO filers; 24 hours × 29 = 696
total incremental burden hours for non-CRIRSCO filers. 71.75 hours + 696 hours = 767.75 total internal
hours (or 768 hours rounded to the nearest whole number). 768 hours/36 = 21.33 avg. incremental burden
hours.

498

For example, we determined the estimated incremental professional costs for Form S-1 as follows: 41
hours × 0.75 = 30.75 outside hours for CRIRSCO filers; 30.75 hours × 7 = 215.25 total outside hours for
CRIRSCO filers. 96 hours × 0.75 = 72 outside hours for non-CRIRSCO filers; 72 hours × 29 = 2088 total
outside hours for non-CRIRSCO filers. 215.25 hours + 2088 hours = 2303.25 total outside hours. 2303.25
hours x $400 = $921,300 total incremental professional costs.

499

The total incremental burden hours and total incremental professional costs are rounded to the nearest
whole number.

We have determined the estimated total burden of complying with the proposed rules for
each form by adding the above described estimated incremental company burden hours to the
current burden hours estimated for each form. We have similarly determined the estimated total
professional costs under the proposed rules for each form by adding the estimated total
incremental professional costs to the current professional costs estimated for each form. Based
on these calculations, as summarized below, we estimate that, as a result of the proposed rules,
the estimated annual burden for all forms would increase to 13,753,285 hours, compared to the
current annual estimate of 13,737,885 hours. We further estimate that the proposed rules would
result in estimated annual professional costs for all forms of $3,329,079,082, compared to the
current annual estimate of $3,324,947,882.

Request for Comments

We request comments in order to evaluate: (1) whether the proposed collections of
information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including
whether the information would have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of our estimate of the
burden of each proposed collection of information; (3) whether there are ways to enhance the
quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; (4) whether there are ways to
minimize the burden of the collections of information on those who are to respond, including
through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology;

230

and (5) whether the proposed rules would have any effects on any other collections of
information not previously identified in this section. 500
Any member of the public may direct to us any comments about the accuracy of these
burden estimates and any suggestions for reducing these burdens. Persons submitting
comments on the collection of information requirements should direct the comments to the
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and should
send a copy to Brent J. Fields, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File No. S7-10-16. Requests for materials
submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to these collections of information should be
in writing, refer to File No. S7-10-16, and be submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-2736. OMB
is required to make a decision concerning the collection of information between 30 and 60 days
after publication of this release. Consequently, a comment to OMB is best assured of having its
full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.

INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 501 requires the Commission, in promulgating

rules under Section 553 of the Administrative Procedures Act, 502 to consider the impact of those

We request comment pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B).

501

231

rules on small entities. Section 603(a) of the RFA 503 generally requires the Commission to
undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules.
A.

Reasons For, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action

The proposed rules are intended to modernize the Commission’s mining disclosure
requirements and policies by conforming them to current industry and global regulatory
practices and standards. In so doing, the proposed rules seek to provide investors with a more
comprehensive understanding of a registrant’s mining operations, which should help them make
more informed investment decisions. As noted above, the proposed rules would:
•

provide a clear and consistent standard for when registrants with mining operations are
required to provide the applicable mining disclosures;

•

consolidate current mining disclosure requirements and standards and related
Commission and staff guidance;

•

require the disclosure of determined mineral resources and material exploration results;
and

•

require that a registrant’s disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources or mineral
reserves be based upon and fairly reflect information and supporting documentation
prepared by a mining industry professional having the requisite level of expertise.
B.

Legal Basis

We are proposing the rule amendments pursuant to Sections 3(b), 7, 10, 19(a), and 28 of
the Securities Act and Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 15(d), 23(a), and 36(a) of the Exchange Act.

503

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

232

C.

Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rule Amendments

The proposed rules would affect small entities that have, or for which it is probable that
they will have, material mining operations, and which file registration statements under Section
6 of the Securities Act or Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and reports under Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act. For purposes of the RFA, under our rules, an issuer, other than an
investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it has total assets of $5
million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage
in an offering of securities that does not exceed $5 million. 504 From staff review of Securities
Act and Exchange Act filings made by registrants with mining operations from January 2014
through December 2015, we estimate that there are approximately 176 issuers that may be
considered small entities.
D.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements

As described in greater detail above, the proposed rules would add to the Securities Act
and Exchange Act disclosure requirements of registrants, including small entities, with material
mining operations by requiring:
•

the disclosure of determined mineral resources and material exploration results in
addition to mineral reserves;

•

the disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources and mineral reserves in SEC
filings to be based on and accurately reflect information and supporting documentation
prepared by a qualified person; and

504

See Securities Act Rule 157 (17 CFR 230.157); and Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a) (17 CFR 240.0-10(a)).

233

•

the filing of a technical report summary prepared by a qualified person for each material
property for certain SEC filings.
The proposed rules would also codify certain existing disclosure policies for registrants

with material mining operations, including small entities. The same mining disclosure
requirements would apply to both U.S. and foreign registrants.
E.

Duplicative, Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules

As noted above, the proposed rules would generally establish new mining disclosure
requirements that we believe would not duplicate or overlap with other federal rules. The
proposed rules would consolidate all of the Commission’s mining disclosure requirements. The
proposed rules would further harmonize certain existing disclosure requirements and policies,
including the disclosure standard for mining disclosure. We believe that this consolidation
would help a mining registrant, including a small entity, comply with its disclosure obligations
under the Securities Act and Exchange Act, which could mitigate its reporting burden. We do
not believe that the proposed rules would conflict with other federal rules.
F.

Significant Alternatives

As noted above, we considered a number of alternatives to the proposed rules. In
considering these alternatives, we sought to accomplish our stated objectives, while minimizing
any significant economic impact on small entities. In connection with the proposed rules, we
considered the following:
•

Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into
account the resources available to small entities;

•

Clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under
the rules for small entities;
234

•

Use of performance rather than design standards; and

•

Exempting small entities from all or part of the proposed rules.
Neither the current mining disclosure requirements nor the proposed rules exempt or

treat differently a small entity with material mining operations. Providing an exemption for, or
imposing less extensive disclosure requirements on, small entities with material mining
operations would likely increase the risk of inaccurate disclosure concerning those entities’
mineral resources, mineral reserves and material exploration results, to the detriment of
investors. Moreover, as noted above, a primary goal of the proposed rules is generally to align
the Commission’s mining disclosure regime with the standards that have developed under the
foreign (CRIRSCO-based) codes so that investors would have a more complete understanding
of a registrant’s mining operations. Those codes do not provide for an exemption for small
entities or otherwise treat such entities differently. Therefore, we believe it would be
inappropriate for our rules to provide an exemption for, or otherwise treat differently, small
entities with material mining operations. We also note that, given that the majority of mining
registrants are small entities, exempting them from the proposed rules would effectively
disapply the Commission’s mining disclosure regime to most of the companies for which such
disclosure would be potentially beneficial. 505
As noted above, the proposed rules would consolidate existing mining disclosure rules
and policies and thereby facilitate compliance for all registrants, including small entities. We
have used design rather than performance standards in connection with the proposed rules
because, based on our past experience, we believe the proposed rules would be more beneficial

505

See Section IV.B.3., supra.

235

to investors if there were specific disclosure requirements that were uniform for all registrants
with material mining operations. The specific disclosure requirements in the proposed rules are
intended to promote consistent and comparable disclosure among all such registrants.
G.

Request for Comment

We encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect of this Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. In particular, we request comments regarding:
•

how the proposed rule amendments can achieve their objective while lowering the
burden on small entities;

•

the number of small entity companies that may be affected by the proposed
amendments;

•

the existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposed amendments on small
entity companies discussed in the analysis; and

•

how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.
Respondents are asked to describe the nature of any impact and provide empirical data

supporting the extent of the impact. We will consider such comments in the preparation of the
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed rule amendments are adopted, and will
place those comments in the same public file as comments on the proposed amendments
themselves.
VII.

SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT FAIRNESS ACT
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 506 a

rule is “major” if it has resulted, or is likely to result in:

506

Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

236

•

an annual effect on the U.S. economy of $100 million or more;

•

a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation.
We request comment and empirical data on whether our proposal would be a “major

rule” for purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act.

material if they consist of 10% or more of its total assets.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (b): A registrant’s mining operations may be material even if
they comprise less than 10% of its total assets if, when considered with other quantitative or
qualitative factors, the required disclosure concerning the mining operations would significantly
alter the total mix of information available.
(c) Upon a determination that its mining operations are material, a registrant must
provide summary disclosure concerning all of its mining activities, as specified in § 229.1303, as
well as individual property disclosure concerning each of its mining properties that is material to
its business or financial condition, as specified in § 229.1304. When providing either summary
or individual property disclosure, the registrant:
(1) Should provide an appropriate glossary if the disclosure requires the use of technical
terms relating to geology, mining or related matters, which cannot readily be found in
conventional dictionaries;
(2) Should not include detailed illustrations and technical reports, full feasibility studies
or other highly technical data. The registrant shall, however, furnish such reports and other
material supplementally to the staff upon request; and
(3) Should use plain English principles, to the extent practicable, such as those provided
in 17 CFR 230.421 and 17 CFR 240.13a-20, to enhance the readability of the disclosure for
investors.
(d) Definitions. As used in this subpart 229.1300, these terms have the following
meanings:

259

(1) Cut-off grade is the grade (i.e., the concentration of metal or mineral in rock) which
determines the destination of the material during mining. For purposes of establishing
“prospects of economic extraction,” the cut-off grade is the grade which distinguishes material
that is deemed to have no economic value (it will not be mined in underground mining or if
mined in surface mining, its destination will be the waste dump) from material that is deemed to
have economic value (its ultimate destination during mining will be a processing facility). Other
terms used in similar fashion as cut-off grades include net smelter returns, pay limits, and breakeven stripping ratio.
(2) A development stage issuer is one that is engaged in the preparation of mineral
reserves for extraction on at least one material property.
(3) A development stage property is one that has mineral reserves disclosed, pursuant to
this subpart, but no material extraction.
(4) Exploration results are data and information generated by mineral exploration
programs (i.e., programs consisting of sampling, drilling, trenching, analytical testing, assaying,
and other similar activities undertaken to locate, investigate, define or delineate a mineral
prospect or mineral deposit) that are not part of a disclosure of mineral resources or reserves. A
registrant must not use exploration results alone to derive estimates of tonnage, grade, and
production rates, or in an assessment of economic viability.
(5) An exploration stage issuer is one that has no material property with mineral reserves
disclosed.
(6) An exploration stage property is one that has no mineral reserves disclosed.
(7)(i) A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected
development option for a mineral project, which includes detailed assessments of all applicable
260

modifying factors, as defined by this section, together with any other relevant operational factors,
and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that
extraction is economically viable. The results of the study may serve as the basis for a final
decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of
the project.
(ii) A feasibility study is more comprehensive, and with a higher degree of accuracy,
than a pre-feasibility study. It must contain mining, infrastructure, and process designs
completed with sufficient rigor to serve as the basis for an investment decision or to support
project financing.
Note to paragraph (d)(7): The confidence level in the results of a feasibility study is
higher than that with a pre-feasibility study. Terms such as full, final, comprehensive, bankable,
or definitive feasibility study are equivalent to a feasibility study.
(8) A final market study is a comprehensive study to determine and support the existence
of a readily accessible market for the mineral. It must, at a minimum, include product
specifications based on final geologic and metallurgical testing, supply and demand forecasts,
historical prices for the preceding five or more years, estimated long term prices, evaluation of
competitors (including products and estimates of production volumes, sales, and prices),
customer evaluation of product specifications, and market entry strategies or sales contracts. The
study must provide justification for all assumptions, which must include all material contracts
required to develop and sell the mineral reserves.
(9)(i) An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity
and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling.

261

(ii) As used in this subpart, the term adequate geological evidence means evidence that
is sufficient to establish geological and grade or quality continuity with reasonable certainty.
The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to
allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail
to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.
Note to paragraph (d)( 9): An indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence
than that applying to a measured mineral resource and may only be converted to a probable
mineral reserve.
(10)(i) An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity
and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling.
(ii) As used in this subpart, the term limited geological evidence means evidence that is
only sufficient to establish that geological and grade or quality continuity is more likely than not.
The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to
apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in a manner useful for evaluation of economic
viability.
(iii) A qualified person:
(A) Must have a reasonable expectation that the majority of inferred mineral resources
could be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources with continued exploration; and
(B) Should be able to defend the basis of this expectation before his or her peers.
Note to paragraph (d)(10):

An inferred mineral resource has the lowest level of

geological confidence of all mineral resources, which prevents the application of the modifying
factors in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. As such, inferred mineral

262

resource may not be considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project and
may not be converted to a mineral reserve.
(11)(i) An initial assessment is a preliminary technical and economic study of the
economic potential of all or parts of mineralization to support the disclosure of mineral
resources. The initial assessment must be prepared by a qualified person and must include
appropriate assessments of reasonably assumed modifying factors, as defined by this section,
together with any other relevant operational factors that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time
of reporting, that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
(ii) An initial assessment is required for disclosure of mineral resources but cannot be
used as the basis for disclosure of mineral reserves.
(12)(i) A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity
and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling.
(ii) As used in this subpart, the term conclusive geological evidence means evidence that
is sufficient to test and confirm geological and grade or quality continuity. The level of
geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified
person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support
detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.
Note to paragraph (d)(12): A measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence
than that applying to either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource. It may
be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve.
(13)(i) A mineral reserve is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and
measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an
economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a
263

measured or indicated mineral resource, net of allowances for diluting materials and for losses
that may occur when the material is mined or extracted.
(ii) The determination that part of a measured or indicated mineral resource is
economically mineable must be based on a preliminary feasibility (pre-feasibility) or feasibility
study, as defined by this section, conducted by a qualified person applying the modifying factors
to indicated or measured mineral resources. Such study must demonstrate that, at the time of
reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment
and market assumptions. The study must establish a life of mine plan that is technically
achievable and economically viable, which will be the basis of determining the mineral reserve.
(iii) As used in this subpart, the term economically viable means that the qualified person
has determined, using a discounted cash flow analysis, or has otherwise analytically determined,
that extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and
market assumptions.
(iv) As used in this subpart, the term investment and market assumptions includes all
assumptions made about the prices, exchange rates, sales volumes and costs that are necessary
and are used to determine the economic viability of the reserves. The price shall be no higher
than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of the fiscal year covered
by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the daily closing price for each
trading day within such period, except in cases where sales prices are determined by contractual
agreements. In such a case, the qualified person may use the price set by the contractual
arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable, and the qualified person discloses that he or
she is using a contractual price and discloses the contractual price used.

264

Note to paragraph (d)(13): A qualified person must subdivide mineral reserves, in order
of increasing confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors to
the indicated and measured mineral resources, into probable mineral reserves and proven mineral
reserves, as defined in this section.
(14)(i) A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic
interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are
reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
(ii) As used in this subpart, the term material of economic interest includes
mineralization, including dumps and tailings, geothermal fields, mineral brines, and other
resources extracted on or within the earth’s crust. It does not include oil and gas resources as
defined in Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(16)(D) of this chapter, gases (e.g., helium and carbon
dioxide), and water.
(iii) When determining the existence of a mineral resource, a qualified person, as defined
by this section, must:
(A) Be able to estimate or interpret the location, quantity, grade or quality continuity,
and other geological characteristics of the mineral resource from specific geological evidence
and knowledge, including sampling; and
(B) Conclude that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction of the mineral
resource based on an initial assessment, as defined in this section, that he or she conducts by
qualitatively applying the modifying factors, as defined by this section, likely to influence the
prospect of economic extraction.
Note to paragraph (d)(14)(i): A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of
mineralization, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining
265

dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic
conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable. It is not merely an
inventory of all mineralization drilled or sampled.
Note to paragraph (d)(14)(ii): A qualified person must subdivide mineral resources, in
order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured mineral
resources.
(15) Modifying factors are the factors that a qualified person must apply to
mineralization or geothermal energy and then evaluate in order to establish the economic
prospects of mineral resources, or the economic viability of mineral reserves. A qualified person
must apply and evaluate modifying factors to convert measured and indicated mineral resources
to proven and probable mineral reserves. These factors include, but are not restricted to, mining,
energy recovery and conversion, processing, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal,
environmental, infrastructure, social and governmental factors. The number, type and specific
characteristics of the modifying factors applied will necessarily be a function of and depend upon
the mineral, mine, property, or project.
(16)(i) A preliminary feasibility study (pre-feasibility study) is a comprehensive study of
a range of options for the technical and economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced
to a stage where a qualified person has determined (in the case of underground mining) a
preferred mining method, or (in the case of surface mining) a pit configuration, and in all cases
has determined an effective method of mineral processing and an effective plan to sell the
product.
(ii) A pre-feasibility study includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions,
based on appropriate testing, about the modifying factors and the evaluation of any other relevant
266

factors that are sufficient for a qualified person to determine if all or part of the indicated and
measured mineral resources may be converted to mineral reserves at the time of reporting. The
financial analysis must have the level of detail necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting,
that extraction is economically viable.
Note to paragraph (d)(16): A pre-feasibility study is less comprehensive and results in a
lower confidence level than a feasibility study. A pre-feasibility study is more comprehensive
and results in a higher confidence level than an initial assessment.
(17) A preliminary market study is a study that is sufficiently rigorous and
comprehensive to determine and support the existence of a readily accessible market for the
mineral. It must, at a minimum, include product specifications based on preliminary geologic
and metallurgical testing, supply and demand forecasts, historical prices for the preceding five or
more years, estimated long term prices, evaluation of competitors (including products and
estimates of production volumes, sales, and prices), customer evaluation of product
specifications, and market entry strategies. The study must provide justification for all
assumptions. It can, however, be less rigorous and comprehensive than a final market study,
which is required for a full feasibility study.
(18)(i) A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated
and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource.
(ii) For a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person’s confidence in the results
obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage and grade
or quality is lower than what is sufficient for a classification as a proven mineral reserve, but is
still sufficient to demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is
economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The lower level of
267

confidence is due to higher geologic uncertainty when the qualified person converts an indicated
mineral resource to a probable reserve or higher risk in the results of the application of
modifying factors at the time when the qualified person converts a measured mineral resource to
a probable mineral reserve.
(iii) A qualified person must classify a measured mineral resource as a probable mineral
reserve when his or her confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying
factors to the measured mineral resource is lower than what is sufficient for a proven mineral
reserve.
(19) A production stage issuer is one that is engaged in material extraction of mineral
reserves on at least one material property.
(20) A production stage property is one with material extraction of mineral reserves.
(21)(i) A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured
mineral resource.
(ii) For a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person has a high degree of confidence in
the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage
and grade or quality.
(iii) A proven mineral reserve can only result from conversion of a measured mineral
resource.
(22) A qualified person is:
(i) A mineral industry professional with at least five years of relevant experience in the
type of mineralization and type of deposit under consideration and in the specific type of activity
that person is undertaking on behalf of the registrant; and

268

(ii) An eligible member or licensee in good standing of a recognized professional
organization at the time the technical report is prepared. For an organization to be a recognized
professional organization, it must:
(A) Be either:
(1) An organization recognized within the mining industry as a reputable professional
association, or
(2) A board authorized by U.S. federal, state or foreign statute to regulate professionals
in the mining, geoscience or related field;
(B) Admit eligible members primarily on the basis of their academic qualifications and
experience;
(C) Establish and require compliance with professional standards of competence and
ethics;
(D) Require or encourage continuing professional development;
(E) Have and apply disciplinary powers, including the power to suspend or expel a
member regardless of where the member practices or resides; and
(F) Provide a public list of members in good standing.
Instruction 1 to paragraph (d)(22): The term relevant experience means, for purposes of
determining whether a party is a qualified person, that the party has experience in the specific
type of activity that the person is undertaking on behalf of the registrant. If the qualified person
is preparing or supervising the preparation of a technical report concerning exploration results,
the relevant experience must be in exploration. If the qualified person is estimating, or
supervising the estimation of mineral resources, the relevant experience must be in the
estimation, assessment and evaluation of mineral resources and associated modifying factors, as
269

defined in this section. If the qualified person is estimating, or supervising the estimation of
mineral reserves, the relevant experience must be in engineering and other disciplines required
for the estimation, assessment, evaluation and economic extraction of mineral reserves.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (d)(22): The term relevant experience also means, for
purposes of determining whether a party is a qualified person, that the party has experience
evaluating the specific type of mineral deposit under consideration, e.g., coal, metal, base metal,
industrial mineral, mineral brine, or geothermal fields. The type of experience necessary to
qualify as relevant is a facts and circumstances determination. For example, experience in a
high-nugget, vein-type mineralization such as tin or tungsten would likely be relevant experience
for estimating mineral resources for vein-gold mineralization whereas experience in a low grade
disseminated gold deposit likely would not be relevant.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (d)(22): It is not always necessary for a person to have five
years’ experience in each and every type of deposit in order to be an eligible qualified person if
that person has relevant experience in similar deposit types. For example, a person with 20
years’ experience in estimating mineral resources for a variety of metalliferous hard-rock deposit
types may not require as much as five years of specific experience in porphyry-copper deposits
to act as a qualified person. Relevant experience in the other deposit types could count towards
the experience in relation to porphyry-copper deposits.
Instruction 4 to paragraph (d)(22): For a qualified person providing a technical report for
exploration results or mineral resource estimates, relevant experience also requires, in addition to
experience in the type of mineralization, sufficient experience with the sampling and analytical
techniques, as well as extraction and processing techniques, relevant to the mineral deposit under
consideration. Sufficient experience means that level of experience necessary to be able to
270

identify, with substantial confidence, problems that could affect the reliability of data and issues
associated with processing.
Instruction 5 to paragraph (d)(22): For a qualified person applying the modifying factors,
as defined by this section, to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves, relevant experience
also requires:
i. Sufficient knowledge and experience in the application of these factors to the mineral
deposit under consideration; and
ii. Experience with the geology, geostatistics, mining, extraction and processing that is
applicable to the type of mineral and mining under consideration.
§ 229.1302 (Item 1302) Qualified person, technical report summary, and technical studies.
(a) A registrant’s disclosure of exploration results, mineral resources or mineral reserves,
as required by § 229.1303 and § 229.1304, must be based on and accurately reflect information
and supporting documentation prepared by a qualified person, as defined in § 229.1301(d). The
registrant is responsible for determining that the person meets the qualifications specified under
the definition of qualified person in § 229.1301(d), and that the disclosure in the registrant’s
filing accurately reflects the information provided by the qualified person.
(b)(1) The registrant must obtain a dated and signed technical report summary from the
qualified person, which, pursuant to § 229.601(b)(96), identifies and summarizes the information
reviewed and conclusions reached by the qualified person about the registrant’s mineral
resources, mineral reserves or material exploration results determined to be on each material
property.
(2) The registrant must file the technical report summary, pursuant to § 229.601(b)(96),
as an exhibit to the relevant registration statement or other Commission filing when disclosing
271

for the first time mineral reserves, mineral resources or material exploration results or when there
is a material change in the mineral reserves, mineral resources or exploration results from the last
technical report summary filed for the property.
Instruction to paragraph (b)(2): A royalty company does not have to submit a separate
technical report summary for a property that is covered by a current technical report summary
filed by the producing mining registrant. In that situation, the royalty company must incorporate
by reference the producing registrant’s previously filed technical report summary in the royalty
company’s filing with the Commission.
(3)(i) The registrant must obtain the written consent of the qualified person to the use of
the qualified person’s name and any quotation or other use of the technical report summary in the
registration statement or report prior to filing the technical report summary with the Commission.
(ii) For Securities Act filings, the registrant must file the written consent as an exhibit to
the registration statement pursuant to § 230.436 and § 230.601(b)(23) of this chapter.
(4) The registrant must identify the qualified person who prepared the technical report
summary in the filed registration statement or report and state whether the qualified person is an
employee of the registrant. If the qualified person is not an employee of the registrant, the
registrant must name the qualified person’s employer, disclose whether the qualified person or
the qualified person’s employer is an affiliate of the registrant or another entity that has an
ownership, royalty or other interest in the property that is the subject of the technical report
summary, and if an affiliate, describe the nature of the affiliation.
Instruction to paragraph (b)(4): As used in this section, affiliate has the same meaning as in
§ 230.405 or § 240.12b-2 of this chapter.

272

(c) A registrant’s disclosure of mineral resources under subpart 1300 of this part must be
based upon a qualified person’s initial assessment, as defined in § 229.1301(d), which supports
the determination of mineral resources. At a minimum, the initial assessment must include the
qualified person’s qualitative evaluation of applicable modifying factors to establish the
economic potential of the mining property or project. The technical report summary submitted
by the qualified person to support a determination of mineral resources must describe the
procedures, findings and conclusions reached for the initial assessment, as required by
§ 229.601(b)(96).
Instruction 1 to paragraph (c): A qualified person must include cut-off grade estimation,
based on assumed unit costs for surface or underground operations and estimated mineral prices,
in the initial assessment. To estimate mineral prices, the qualified person must use a commodity
price that is no higher than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of
the last fiscal year, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the daily closing price for
each trading day within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements. In
such a case, the qualified person may use the price set by the contractual arrangement, provided
that such price is reasonable, and the qualified person discloses that he or she is using a
contractual price and discloses the contractual price used.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (c): The qualified person must provide qualitative assessment
of all relevant modifying factors, as defined in § 229.1301(d), to establish economic potential
and justify why he or she believes that all issues can be resolved with further exploration and
analysis. As provided by Table 1 of this section, those factors include, but are not limited to:
i. Site infrastructure (e.g. whether access to power and site is possible);
ii. Mine design and planning (e.g. what is the broadly defined mining method);
273

iii. Processing plant (e.g. whether all products used in assessing prospects of economic
extraction can be processed with methods consistent with each other);
iv. Environmental compliance and permitting (e.g. what are the required permits and
corresponding agencies and whether significant obstacles exist to obtaining those permits); and
v. Any other reasonably assumed modifying factors, including socio-economic factors,
necessary to demonstrate reasonable prospects for economic extraction.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (c): Additionally, a qualified person may include cash flow
analysis in an initial assessment to demonstrate economic potential. The qualified person may
not, however, use inferred mineral resources in such cash flow analysis. If the qualified person
includes cash flow analysis in the initial assessment, then operating and capital cost estimates
must have an accuracy level of at least approximately ±50% and a contingency level of no
greater than 25%, as provided by Table 1 of this section. The qualified person must state the
accuracy and contingency levels in the initial assessment.
Instruction 4 to paragraph (c): The qualified person should refer to Table 1 of this section
for the assumptions permitted to be made when preparing the initial assessment.

The modifying factors, as defined in this section, include, but are not limited to, the factors listed in this table. The
number, type and specific characteristics of the modifying factors applied will be a function of and depend upon the
mineral, mine, property, or project.

275

2

Initial Assessment, as defined in this section, does not require cash flow analyses or operating and capital cost
estimates. The qualified person may include such cash flow analyses at his or her discretion.
3
Initial assessment does not require capital and operating cost estimates or economic analysis, although it requires
unit cost assumptions based on an assumption that the resource will be exploited with surface or underground
mining methods. Economic analyses, if included, must only be based on measured and indicated mineral resources.

(d) A registrant’s disclosure of mineral reserves under subpart 1300 of this part must be
based upon a qualified person’s pre-feasibility study or feasibility study, each as defined in
§ 229.1301(d), which supports a determination of mineral reserves. The pre-feasibility or
feasibility study must include the qualified person’s detailed evaluation of all applicable
modifying factors to demonstrate the economic viability of the mining property or project. The
technical report summary submitted by the qualified person to support a determination of
mineral reserves must describe the procedures, findings and conclusions reached for the prefeasibility or feasibility study, as required by § 229.601(b)(96). All reserve disclosures based on
a pre-feasibility study must include the qualified person’s justification for using a pre-feasibility
study instead of a final feasibility study.
Instruction 1 to paragraph (d): The term mineral reserves does not necessarily require
that extraction facilities are in place or operational, that the company has obtained all necessary
permits or that the company has entered into sales contracts for the sale of mined products. It
does require, however, that the qualified person has, after reasonable investigation, not identified
any obstacles to obtaining permits and entering into the necessary sales contracts, and reasonably
believes that the chances of obtaining such approvals and contracts in a timely manner are highly
likely. In addition, in certain circumstances, it may require the completion of at least a
preliminary market study, as defined in § 229.1301(d), in the context of a pre-feasibility study, or
a final market study, as defined in § 229.1301(d), in the context of a feasibility study, to support
the qualified person’s conclusions about the chances of obtaining revenues from sales. For
276

example, a preliminary or final market study would be required where the mine’s product cannot
be traded on an exchange, there is no other established market for the product, and no sales
contract exists. When assessing mineral reserves, the qualified person must take into account the
potential adverse impacts, if any, from any unresolved material matter on which extraction is
contingent and which is dependent on a third party.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (d): The qualified person must exclude inferred mineral
resources from the pre-feasibility study’s demonstration of economic viability in support of a
disclosure of a mineral reserve.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (d): Factors to be considered in a pre-feasibility study are
typically the same as those required for an initial assessment, but considered at a greater level of
detail or at a later stage of development. For example, as provided in Table 1 of this section, a
pre-feasibility study must define, analyze or otherwise address in detail:
i. The required access roads, infrastructure location and plant area, and the source of all
utilities (e.g. power and water) required for development and production;
ii. The preferred underground mining method or surface mine pit configuration, with
detailed mine layouts drawn for each alternative;
iii. The bench lab tests that have been conducted, the process flow sheet, equipment
sizes, and general arrangement that have been completed, and the plant throughput;
iv. The environmental compliance and permitting requirements or interests of agencies,
non-governmental organizations, communities and other stakeholders, the baseline studies, and
the plans for tailings disposal, reclamation and mitigation, together with an analysis establishing
that permitting is possible; and

277

v. And any other reasonable assumptions, based on appropriate testing, on the modifying
factors sufficient to demonstrate that extraction is economically viable.
Instruction 4 to paragraph (d): A pre-feasibility study must include an economic analysis
that supports the property’s economic viability as assessed by a detailed discounted cash flow
analysis or other similar financial analysis. The economic analysis must describe in detail
applicable taxes and provide an estimate of revenues. As discussed in Instruction 1 to paragraph
(d) of this Item, in certain situations, estimates of revenues must be based on at least a
preliminary market study.
Instruction 5 to paragraph (d): The pre-feasibility study must also identify sources of
uncertainty that require further refinement in a final feasibility study.
Instruction 6 to paragraph (d): Operating and capital cost estimates in a pre-feasibility
study must, at a minimum, have an accuracy level of approximately ±25% and a contingency
range not exceeding 15%, as provided in Table 1 of this section. The qualified person must state
the accuracy level and contingency range in the pre-feasibility study.
Instruction 7 to paragraph (d): In some instances, the risk factors associated with a
project may indicate that more than a pre-feasibility study is required to disclose mineral
reserves, e.g., in situations where the project is the first in a particular mining district with
substantially different conditions than existing company projects, such as environmental and
permitting restrictions, labor availability and skills, remoteness, and unique mineralization and
recovery methods. In such cases, the qualified person must use a feasibility study in order to
achieve the level of confidence necessary for disclosing mineral reserves.
Instruction 8 to paragraph (d): A feasibility study must contain the application and
description of all relevant modifying factors in a more detailed form and with more certainty
278

than a pre-feasibility study. For example, as provided in Table 1 of this section, a feasibility
study must define, analyze or otherwise address in detail:
i. Final requirements for site infrastructure, including well-defined access roads,
finalized plans for infrastructure location, plant area, and camp or town site, and the established
source of all required utilities (e.g. power and water) for development and production;
ii. Finalized mining method, including detailed mine layouts and final development and
production plan for the preferred alternative with the required equipment fleet specified. The
feasibility study must address detailed mining schedules, construction and production ramp up,
and project execution plans;
iii. Completed detailed bench lab tests and a pilot plant test, if required, based on risk.
The feasibility study must further address final requirements for process flow sheet, equipment
sizes, and general arrangement and specify the final plant throughput;
iv. The final identification and detailed analysis of environmental compliance and
permitting requirements, including the finalized interests of agencies, NGOs, communities and
other stakeholders. The feasibility study must further address the completion of baseline studies
and finalized plans for tailings disposal, reclamation and mitigation; and
v. Detailed assessments of other modifying factors necessary to demonstrate that
extraction is economically viable.
Instruction 9 to paragraph (d): A feasibility study must also include an economic analysis
that describes taxes in detail, estimates revenues and assesses economic viability by a detailed
discounted cash flow analysis. As discussed in Instruction 1 to paragraph (d) of this Item, in
certain situations, estimates of revenues must be based on a final market study or letters of intent
to purchase.
279

Instruction 10 to paragraph (d): Operating and capital cost estimates in a feasibility study
must, at a minimum, have an accuracy level of approximately ±15% and a contingency range not
exceeding 10%, as provided by Table 1 of this section. The qualified person must state the
accuracy level and contingency range in the feasibility study.
Instruction 11 to paragraph (d): If the uncertainties in the results obtained from the
application of the modifying factors that prevented a measured mineral resource from being
converted to a proven mineral reserve no longer exist, then the qualified person may convert the
measured mineral resource to a proven mineral reserve.
Instruction 12 to paragraph (d): The qualified person cannot convert an indicated mineral
resource to a proven mineral reserve unless new evidence first justifies conversion to a measured
mineral resource.
Instruction 13 to paragraph (d): The qualified person cannot convert an inferred mineral
resource to a mineral reserve without first obtaining new evidence that justifies converting it to
an indicated or measured mineral resource.
§ 229.1303 (Item 1303) Summary disclosure.
(a)(1) A registrant that has material mining operations, as determined pursuant to
§ 229.1301, and two or more mining properties, must provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this section for all properties that the registrant:
(i) Owns or in which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a direct or indirect
economic interest;
(ii) Operates, or it is probable that it will operate, under a lease or other legal agreement
that grants the registrant ownership or similar rights that authorize it, as principal, to sell or
otherwise dispose of the mineral; or
280

(iii) Has, or it is probable that it will have, an associated royalty or similar right.
(2) A registrant that has material mining operations but only one mining property is not
required to provide the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section. That registrant
need only provide the disclosure required by § 229.1304 for the mining property that is material
to its business.

combined measured and indicated mineral resources. This summary must be provided for each
class of mineral reserves (probable and proven) and resources (inferred, indicated and measured),
together with total mineral reserves and total measured and indicated mineral resources, using
the format in Table 3 of this section.
282

Instruction 1 to paragraph (b)(3): The term by geographic area means by individual
country, regions of a country, state, groups of states, mining district, or other political units, to
the extent material to and necessary for an investor’s understanding of a registrant’s mining
operations.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (b)(3): All disclosure of mineral resources must be exclusive
of mineral reserves.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (b)(3): All disclosure of mineral resources and reserves must
be only for the portion of the resources or reserves attributable to the registrant’s interest in the
property.
Instruction 4 to paragraph (b)(3): All mineral resource and reserve estimates must be
based on long term price that is no higher than the average spot price over the 24-month period
prior to the end of the fiscal year covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the daily closing price for each trading day within such period, unless prices are
defined by contractual arrangements.
Instruction 5 to paragraph (b)(3): Mineral resource and reserve estimates called for in
Table 3 of this section must be in terms of saleable product.

Unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, the registrant must use a commodity price that is no higher
than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of the last fiscal year, determined as an
unweighted arithmetic average of the daily closing price for each trading day within such period and must disclose
the price used. When prices are defined by contractual agreements, the registrant may use the price set by the
contractual arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable, and the registrant discloses that it is using a
contractual price and discloses the contractual price used.

§ 229.1304 (Item 1304) Individual property disclosure.
(a) A registrant must disclose the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section
for each property that is material to its business or financial condition. When determining the
materiality of a property relative to its business or financial condition, a registrant must apply the
standards and other considerations specified in § 229.1301(b) to each individual property that it:
(i) Owns or in which it has, or it is probable that it will have, a direct or indirect
economic interest;
(ii) Operates, or it is probable that it will operate, under a lease or other legal agreement
that grants the registrant ownership or similar rights that authorize it, as principal, to sell or
otherwise dispose of the mineral; or
(iii) Has, or it is probable that it will have, an associated royalty or similar right.
(b) Disclose the following information for each material property specified in paragraph
(a) of this section:
(1) A brief description of the property including:
284

(i) The location, accurate to within one mile, using an easily recognizable coordinate
system. The registrant must provide appropriate maps, with proper engineering detail (such as
scale, orientation, and titles). Such maps must be legible on the page when printed;
(ii) Existing infrastructure including roads, railroads, airports, towns, ports, sources of
water, electricity, and personnel; and
(iii) A brief description, including the name or number and size (acreage), of the titles,
claims, concessions, mineral rights, leases or options under which the registrant and its
subsidiaries have or will have the right to hold or operate the property, and how such rights are
obtained at this location, indicating any conditions that the registrant must meet in order to obtain
or retain the property. If held by leases or options or if the mineral rights otherwise have
termination provisions, the registrant must provide the expiration dates of such leases, options or
mineral rights and associated payments.
(iv) If the registrant holds a royalty or similar interest or will have an associated royalty
or similar right, the disclosure must describe all of the information in paragraph (b)(1) of this
section, including, for example, the documents under which the owner or operator holds or
operates the property, the mineral rights held by the owner or operator, conditions required to be
met by the owner or operator, and the expiration dates of leases, options and mineral rights. The
registrant must also briefly describe the agreement under which the registrant and its subsidiaries
have or will have the right to a royalty or similar interest in the property, indicating any
conditions that the registrant must meet in order to obtain or retain the royalty or similar interest,
and indicating the expiration date.
(2) A brief history of previous operations, including the names of previous operators,
insofar as known;
285

(3) The following information, as relevant to the particular property:
(i) A brief description of the present condition of the property, the work completed by
the registrant on the property, the registrant’s proposed program of exploration or development,
the current stage of the property as exploration, development or production, the current state of
exploration or development of the property, and the current production activities. Mines should
be identified as either surface or underground, with a brief description of the mining method and
processing operations. If the property is without known reserves and the proposed program is
exploratory in nature or the registrant has started extraction without determining mineral
reserves, the registrant must provide a statement to that effect;
(ii) The age, details as to modernization and physical condition of the equipment,
facilities, infrastructure, and underground development; and
(iii) The total cost for or book value of the property and its associated plant and
equipment.
Instruction to paragraph (b)(3): A registrant must identify an individual property with no
mineral reserves as an exploration stage property, even if it has other properties in development
or production. Similarly, a registrant that does not have reserves on any of its properties cannot
characterize itself as a development or production stage company, even if it has mineral
resources or exploration results, or even if it is engaged in extraction without first disclosing
mineral reserves.
(4) A brief description of any significant encumbrances to the property, including current
and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations
and fines.

286

(5) A summary of the exploration activity for the most recently completed fiscal year in
tabular form, which, for each sampling method used, discloses the number of samples, the total
size or length of the samples, and the total number of assays. The information must be presented
using the format in Table 4 of this section.

(6) A summary of material exploration results for the most recently completed fiscal year
in tabular form, which, for each property, identifies the hole that generated the exploration
results, and describes the length, lithology and key geologic properties of the exploration results.
This information must be presented using the format provided in Table 5 of this section, and
accompanied by a brief discussion of the exploration results’ context and relevance.
Instruction to paragraph (b)(6): When determining whether exploration results are
material, a registrant should consider their importance in assessing the value of a material
property or in deciding whether to develop the property.

Unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, the registrant must use a commodity price that is no higher
than the average spot price during the 24-month period prior to the end of the last fiscal year, determined as an
unweighted arithmetic average of the daily closing price for each trading day within such period and must disclose
the price used. When prices are defined by contractual agreements, the registrant may use the price set by the
contractual arrangement, provided that such price is reasonable, and the registrant discloses that it is using a
contractual price and discloses the contractual price used.

Instruction 1 to paragraphs (b)(5) through (7): The registrant should not include
extensive description of regional geology. Rather, it should include geological information that
is brief and relevant to property disclosure.
Instruction 2 to paragraphs (b)(5) through (7): The registrant may modify the tabular
formats in Tables 4 through 6 of this section for ease of presentation, to add information, or to
combine two or more required tables.
288

Instruction 3 to paragraphs (b)(5) through (7): All disclosure of mineral resources must
be exclusive of mineral reserves.
Instruction 4 to paragraphs (b)(5) through (7): A registrant with only a royalty interest
should provide only the portion of the resources or reserves that are subject to the royalty or
similar agreement.
(8) Provide a comparison in tabular form of the property’s mineral resources and
reserves as of the end of the last fiscal year against the mineral resources and reserves as of the
end of the preceding fiscal year, with an explanation of any material change between the two.
The comparison must use the tabular format, as provided in Tables 7 and 8 of this section, which
discloses information concerning:
(i) The mineral resources or reserves at the end of the last two fiscal years;
(ii) The net difference between the mineral resources or reserves at the end of the last
completed fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year, as a percentage of the resources or reserves
at the end of the fiscal year preceding the last completed one;
(iii) An explanation of the causes of any discrepancy in mineral resources including
depletion or production, changes in commodity prices, additional resources discovered through
exploration, and changes due to the methods employed; and
(iv) An explanation of the causes of any discrepancy in mineral reserves including
depletion or production, changes in the resource model, changes in commodity prices and
operating costs, changes due to the methods employed, and changes due to acquisition or
disposal of properties.
Table 7. Mineral resource reconciliation. Only the sum of Measured and Indicated Resources

(9) If the registrant has not previously disclosed mineral reserve or resource estimates in
a filing with the Commission or is disclosing material changes to its previously disclosed mineral
reserve or resource estimates, provide a brief discussion of the material assumptions and criteria
in the disclosure and cite to corresponding sections of the technical report summary, which must
be filed as an exhibit pursuant to § 229.1302(b).
(10) If the registrant has not previously disclosed material exploration results in a filing
with the Commission, or is disclosing material changes to its previously disclosed exploration
results, it must provide sufficient information to allow for an accurate understanding of the
290

Comments

significance of the exploration results. This must include information such as exploration
context, type and method of sampling, sampling intervals and methods, relevant sample
locations, distribution, dimensions, and relative location of all relevant assay and physical data,
data aggregation methods, land tenure status, and any additional material information that may
be necessary to make the required disclosure concerning the registrant’s exploration results not
misleading. The registrant must cite to corresponding sections of the summary technical report,
which must be filed as an exhibit pursuant to § 229.1302(b).
Instruction 1 to paragraphs (b)(9) and (10): Whether a change in exploration results,
mineral resources, or mineral reserves, is material is based on all facts and circumstances, both
quantitative and qualitative.
Instruction 2 to paragraphs (b)(9) and (10): A change in exploration results that
significantly alters the potential of the exploration target is considered material.
Instruction 3 to paragraphs (b)(9) and (10): An annual change in total resources or
reserves of 10% or more, excluding production as reported in Tables 7 and 8 of this section, is
presumed to be material.
Instruction 4 to paragraphs (b)(9) and (10): A cumulative change in total resources or
reserves of 30% or more in absolute terms, excluding production as reported in Tables 7 and 8 of
this section, from the current filed technical report summary is presumed to be material.
Instruction 5 to paragraphs (b)(9) and (10): In assessing the presumption of materiality
tests, the registrant should consider the change in total resources or reserves on the basis of total
tonnage or volume of saleable product.
Instruction 6 to paragraphs (b)(9) and (10): A registrant must also carefully consider
whether the filed technical report summary is current with respect to all material assumptions
291

and information, including assumptions relating to all modifying factors and scientific and
technical information (e.g. sampling data, estimation assumptions and methods). To the extent
that the registrant is not filing a technical report summary but instead is basing the required
disclosure upon a previously filed report, that report must also be current in these material
respects. If the previously filed report is not current in these material respects, the registrant
must file a revised or new summary technical report from a qualified person, in compliance with
Item 601(b)(96) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.601(b)(96)), that supports the registrant’s
mining property disclosures.
Instruction 7 to paragraphs (b)(9) and (10): A report containing estimates of the quantity,
grade, or metal or mineral content of a deposit or exploration results that a registrant has not
verified as a current mineral resource, mineral reserve, or exploration results, and which was
prepared before the registrant acquired, or entered into an agreement to acquire, an interest in the
property that contains the deposit, is not considered current and cannot be filed in support of
disclosure.
§ 229.1305 (Item 1305) Internal controls disclosure.
Describe the internal controls that the registrant uses in its exploration and mineral
resource and reserve estimation efforts. This disclosure should include quality control and
quality assurance (QC/QA) programs, verification of analytical procedures, and a discussion of
comprehensive risk inherent in the estimation.
Instruction to Item 1305: A registrant must provide the internal controls disclosure
required by this section whether it is providing the disclosure under § 229.1303, § 229.1304, or
under both sections.
