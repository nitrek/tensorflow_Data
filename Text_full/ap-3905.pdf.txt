ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16229

In the Matter of
GREGORY OSBORN

ORDER

On June 8, 2016, Respondent Gregory Osborn transmitted an email to the Division of
Enforcement and a member of this office. My office has forwarded a copy of the email to the
Office of the Secretary for inclusion in the record. Because the harm resulting from the disclosure
of the personal, medical, and financial information contained in the email would outweigh the
benefits, I SEAL the document. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b). Any party may move to unseal the
document by filing a written motion.
The parties are reminded that if they wish for me to consider any future submissions, they
must file hard copies of all filings with the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street N.E., Mail Stop 1090, Washington, D.C., 20549. Among other
requirements, each filing must include a signed original and three copies, and a certification that
copies have been served on the other party. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.150, .151, .152, .153. Although
electronic courtesy copies of filings may be emailed to alj@sec.gov in PDF text-searchable format,
email is not a substitute for the required hard copy filing.
