proceeding pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic

proceeding should not be determined against Respondents due to their failures to file answers or
otherwise defend the proceeding. Bravo Res. Partners, Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.

proceeding. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
