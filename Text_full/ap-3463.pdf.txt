ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
on December 17, 2015, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on January 4, 2016. The OIP
alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has repeatedly failed to file
required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to revoke the registration of
Respondents’ securities.
The OIP provides that each Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the
OIP on it. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Dome Holding Corp. and Esco, Inc., were each
served with the OIP on December 21, 2015, by USPS Express Mail delivery at “the most recent
address shown on [its] most recent filing with the Commission,” and E-Gold Group, Inc., and
Fortune Pharmaceutical, Inc., Delaware corporations, were each served by personal service on
their Delaware registered agent. 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). To date, each Respondent has
failed to file an Answer within the time provided.
Accordingly, each Respondent IS ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE, by January 19, 2016,
why it should not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities revoked. See
OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
IT IS SO ORDERED.
