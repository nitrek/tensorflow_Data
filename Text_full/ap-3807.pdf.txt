ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3807/April 25, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17185

In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
RINGS TO DINE FOR, INC.

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
on March 29, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Following
review of the Division of Enforcement’s declaration of service, I ordered the Division to file a
supplemental service declaration regarding several issues with the USPS tracking information
provided with the original declaration of service. Rings to Dine For, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3778, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1348 (ALJ Apr. 12, 2016).
Today, the Division filed a supplemental service declaration detailing its conversation
with a USPS customer service representative. The customer service representative told the
Division that the USPS is able to track packages once they enter the Philippines’ mail system and
that Philippines personnel enter the tracking information into its database. Supp. Decl. at 2. The
representative explained that “[c]ustoms clearance processing complete” occurs as the mail
enters the Philippines but was actually completed before the two delivery attempts were made on
April 6 and 7, 2016; “the system marked it as occurring on April 8, 2016 because the Philippine
personnel were just late in entering the information into the database.” Id. I find that
Respondent was served with the OIP in accordance with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), (iv), 17
C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv), on April 6, 2016. See Rings to Dine For, Inc., 2016 SEC LEXIS
1348, at *1 (finding that the Division provided sufficient support that service by mail is
acceptable in the Philippines). Respondent’s answer was thus due by April 19, 2016. To date,
Respondent has not filed an answer.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Respondent Rings to Dine For, Inc., shall SHOW
CAUSE by May 9, 2016, why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default
due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding. If Respondent fails to
respond to this order, it shall be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against it,
and the registration of its securities will be revoked. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2),
.220(f).

I FURTHER ORDER that a telephonic prehearing conference shall be held at 9:30 a.m.
EDT on June 9, 2016, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
