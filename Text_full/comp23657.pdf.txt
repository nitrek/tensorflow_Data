SUMMARY
3.

This case involves a financial fraud perpetrated on Computer Sciences

8

Corporation (“CSC”) by Defendant Keith Hunter, the former Executive Vice

9

President of Information Technology (“IT”) Engineering at Commonwealth Bank of

10

Australia (“CBA”), and a second person (the “Scheme Partner”), who was CSC’s

11

Executive Vice President of Cloud Computing. The Scheme Partner bribed Hunter

12

with a kickback in return for Hunter causing CBA to enter into contracts with CSC in

13

December 2013 and January 2014, for the purpose of inflating CSC’s revenues by

14

over $10 million. The purpose of falsely inflating CSC’s revenue was to meet a $20

15

million threshold for an additional approximately $98 million “earn-out” payment

16

that the Scheme Partner was to share in as the consequence of CSC’s November 2013

17

acquisition of ServiceMesh, Inc. (“SMI”), a private cloud computing company based

18

in Santa Monica, California. The Scheme Partner, a majority shareholder of SMI at

19

the time it was sold to CSC, received over $30 million of the additional $98 million

20

earn-out payment, and funneled at least $630,000 to Hunter through a purported

21

charitable organization. On March 17, 2015, the New South Wales Police arrested

22

Hunter in Sydney, Australia for his receipt of bribes. Hunter has admitted his role in

23

the scheme to defraud CSC and the bribes that he received from the Scheme Partner

24

in return for his participation in the unlawful conduct.

25

4.

The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief against Hunter from

26

violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of

27

Hunter’s ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest thereon, and an officer and

28

director bar.

ALLEGATIONS
A.

Hunter’s Relationship with SMI and the Scheme Partner
9.

The Scheme Partner founded SMI in 2008. SMI’s main product was the

22

Agility Platform (“Agility”), a subscription-based cloud software program that

23

enables large financial, healthcare, and retail institutions to implement a cloud-based

24

IT infrastructure. SMI began selling Agility in 2010.

25

10.

SMI entered into a Master Supply Agreement with CBA on February 2,

26

2011, pursuant to which SMI agreed to provide CBA with Agility software, upgrades,

27

services, and other related clouds products on an ongoing basis.

28

11.
COMPLAINT

In June 2011, four months after the MSA was signed, CBA hired Hunter
3

1

as its Executive Vice President of IT Engineering to manage the development and

2

implementation of CBA’s new cloud computing strategy using SMI’s Agility

3

Platform. CBA asked the Scheme Partner to interview Hunter before he was hired to

4

make sure Hunter would be a good fit for the implementation of the cloud strategy.
12.

5

Immediately after joining CBA, Hunter began working with the Scheme

6

Partner, holding weekly phone calls with him and socializing with him fairly

7

frequently.

CSC’s Acquisition of SMI Includes an “Earn-out Payment”
13.

In 2013, CSC agreed to purchase all of SMI’s shares pursuant to an

10

Equity Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) dated October 29, 2013. Under the terms

11

of the Agreement, CSC was to make an initial cash payment of $163,261,172 to SMI

12

plus a potential earn-out payment of up to $137,014,548 to SMI’s shareholders

13

depending on revenues earned by SMI’s operations for the period from January 1,

14

2013 through January 31, 2014 (the “Measurement Period”).
14.

15

The Earn-out Payment was contingent on SMI’s operations meeting a

16

revenue target during the Measurement Period. Under the terms of the Agreement,

17

CSC was to pay SMI shareholders approximately $10.15 for every dollar of revenue

18

SMI generated on a stand-alone basis if it met a revenue threshold of $20 million

19

during the Measurement Period. The Earn-out Payment was due to be paid in early

20

2014, after the end of the Measurement Period.
15.

21

CSC closed its purchase of SMI on November 15, 2013. Following the

22

closing, SMI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC, the Scheme Partner became

23

CSC’s Executive Vice President of Cloud Computing, and the majority of SMI’s

24

workforce became CSC employees.
16.

25

When CSC’s acquisition of SMI closed, the Scheme Partner received

26

approximately $26 million for his shares of SMI as well as a $13 million bonus

27

payment and an additional $9 million cash payment.

The Scheme to Defraud CSC

Revenue in Exchange for a Kickback

Hunter Agrees to Help the Scheme Partner Generate Earn-out

17.

Hunter learned in September 2013 that CSC planned to acquire SMI, and

5

understood that the terms would include an earn-out clause pursuant to which SMI

6

shareholders could receive an additional payment based on SMI’s software revenue

7

generated through the end of January 2014.

8

18.

Later in September 2013, Hunter traveled with another CBA executive

9

to SMI’s Santa Monica office for in-person meetings. During one of the meetings

10

attended by Hunter, the Scheme Partner, and others, the Scheme Partner offered to

11

pay a kickback to Hunter and two of his CBA colleagues in return for helping SMI

12

shareholders maximize their Earn-out Payment from CSC.

13

19.

Hunter and at least one other CBA employee agreed to help the Scheme

14

Partner generate revenue for SMI through sales to CBA in exchange for the offered

15

kickback.

Hunter Causes CBA to Enter Into Two Deals With CSC

20.

CBA Buys McAfee Software from CSC

In early December 2013, Hunter began to lobby for CBA’s immediate

19

approval of a proposal for CSC to provide McAfee security software and services.

20

While two other companies had offered competitive bids to supply the software,

21

including McAfee itself, Hunter touted the benefits of the deal with CSC and

22

squelched dissenting views voiced by other CBA employees who expressed concerns

23

about CBA buying the McAfee security software so quickly, or from SMI rather than

24

another vendor.

25

21.

On or about December 17, 2013, a CBA employee working in league

26

with Hunter wrote an email to other CBA employees responsible for approving the

27

deal that had raised concerns about the deal that “Keith [Hunter] and I want this

28

sorted out ASAP – with the next 48 hours.”
COMPLAINT

22.

CBA approved the purchase of McAfee software from CSC on

December 23, 2013.
23.

Between the date that CBA approved the purchase from CSC and the

4

end of the Measurement Period on January 31, 2014, CBA’s purchase of McAfee

5

software from CSC generated over $5 million of earn-out revenue that counted

6

towards the Earn-out Payment due to the sellers of SMI.

CBA Purchases Pivotal Software From CSC

Near the end of January 2014, SMI’s total revenues for the Measurement

Period were still below the $20 million threshold for the Earn-out Payment, in which
case the SMI shareholders would receive nothing.
25.

Prior to January 25, 2014, employees of CBA had discussed the

12

possibility, at some point in the future, of purchasing Pivotal Cloud Foundry software

13

and services designed to supplement the Agility platform. No decisions had been

14

made as of that date.

15
16
17

26.

On January 25, 2014, Hunter signed nine individual contracts for CBA

to purchase Pivotal software from CSC.
27.

Hunter and the Scheme Partner structured CBA’s purchase of Pivotal

18

software from CSC as nine separate contracts, so that each contract amount fell below

19

$1 million AUD, which was Hunter’s dollar level of signatory authority at CBA. By

20

breaking the purchase into several smaller contracts, Hunter and the Scheme Partner

21

circumvented CBA’s internal policy requiring contracts over $7 million AUD to be

22

reviewed and approved by higher-level executives.

23

28.

CBA’s January 2014 purchase of Pivotal software from CSC generated

24

over $5.4 million USD of revenue for CSC, which counted toward the revenue target

25

threshold to obtain SMI’s Earn-out Payment.

26

29.

CSC realized revenue of over $10 million from the two CBA software

27

purchases finalized by Hunter and the Scheme Partner in December 2013 and January

28

2014. These two transactions raised the earn-out revenue above the $20 million
COMPLAINT

6

1

threshold, and but for those transactions and the revenue they generated, the SMI

2

shareholders would not have received an Earn-out Payment.

3.

$630,000 Kickback from His Earn-out Proceeds

5

The Scheme Partner Reaps His Ill-Gotten Gains and Pays Hunter a

30.

From January 31 to March 14, 2014, CSC’s technical accounting team

6

and three outside accounting firms reviewed the revenue attributable to SMI’s stand-

7

alone operations, including the post-acquisition contracts with CBA, to determine

8

whether they met CSC’s requirements for revenue recognition and the Agreement’s

9

provisions for an Earn-out Payment to the SMI shareholders.

10

31.

As part of the verification process, the Scheme Partner signed a

11

representation letter dated January 30, 2014, in which he falsely attested that CSC

12

had not entered into any contracts during the Measurement Period pursuant to “any

13

side letters or agreements (written or oral).”

14

32.

CSC management, including its CFO, relied on the Scheme Partner’s

15

representation that all of the revenue generated by SMI’s stand-alone operations

16

during the Measurement Period was legitimately earned without any fraudulent

17

inducements not known to CSC management.

18

33.

On March 14, 2014, pursuant to the Agreement and the provision for an

19

Earn-out Payment, CSC made an additional Earn-out Payment to SMI shareholders in

20

the amount of approximately $98,034,058.

21

34.

The Scheme Partner, who was a majority shareholder of SMI prior to the

22

acquisition, received over $25 million of the additional Earn-out Payment in his

23

individual capacity, and an additional $5.6 million through his wholly-owned

24

company.

25

35.

26
27
28

The approximately $98 million that CSC paid for the Earn-out Payment

constituted 11% of CSC’s pre-tax income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.
36.

After the Scheme Partner received his Earn-out Payment millions, he

transferred a portion of his ill-gotten gains from his wholly-owned company’s

account to his purported non-profit organization.

Texas.

Hunter Conceals, and Then Admits, The Scheme to Defraud CSC
41.

In October 2014, CBA’s group security unit (“CBA Security”)

13

discovered anomalous wire transfers from the bank account of the Scheme Partner’s

14

purported charitable organization to the bank accounts of a CBA executive who

15

traveled with Hunter to California in September 2013. CBA Security tried to

16

question Hunter about these transfers, but Hunter refused to talk about the payments

17

from the purported charitable organization to his colleague.

18

42.

CBA Security subsequently reviewed Hunter’s CBA bank account and

19

discovered the $330,000 wire transfer from the Scheme Partner’s purported charitable

20

organization. CBA Security asked Hunter to provide an explanation for the $330,000

21

payment. In response, Hunter submitted a fabricated Statement of Work (“SOW”)

22

dated May 5, 2014 on “Hunter Management Consulting” letterhead describing

23

management consulting work that he had purportedly provided to the Scheme

24

Partner’s charitable organization. Hunter produced similar false SOWs for the

25

$300,000 that had been wired from the purported charitable organization to Hunter’s

26

Bank of America account in Texas.

27

43.

CBA terminated Hunter on December 24, 2014.

28

44.

The New South Wales Police arrested Hunter on March 17, 2015 on two

COMPLAINT

8

1

counts of bribery. Hunter initially pled not guilty to the charges. Hunter provided the

2

Australian authorities with the same fabricated SOWs he had provided to CBA, and

3

claimed that the Scheme Partner’s purported charitable organization had paid him for

4

legitimate charity-related work.
45.

5

In late 2015, Hunter admitted his role in the scheme to defraud CSC.

6

Hunter admitted that the SOWs were false, and that he had created them in December

7

2014 on his home computer for the sole purpose of providing CBA Security with an

8

explanation for the payments. “Hunter Management Consulting” does not exist, and

9

Hunter was never asked to provide consulting services for the Scheme Partner’s

10

purported charitable organization.

11

At all relevant times, Hunter acted with scienter.
