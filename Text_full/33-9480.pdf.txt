SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
AS TO RESPONDENTS GREGG C.
LORENZO AND CHARLES VISTA, LLC

Respondents.

I.
On February 15, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) instituted
proceedings against Gregg C. Lorenzo (“Gregg Lorenzo”), Francis V. Lorenzo (“Frank Lorenzo”),
and Charles Vista, LLC (“Charles Vista”) (collectively “Respondents”) pursuant to Section 8A of
the Securities Act of 1933(“Securities Act”) and Sections 15(b), 21B, and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Respondents Gregg Lorenzo and Charles Vista (collectively, the “Settling Respondents”)
have submitted an Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to
accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the
subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, the Settling Respondents consent to the
entry of this Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist

Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b), 21B, and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and the Offer, the Commission finds1 that
Summary
1.
Beginning in or about September 2009, Respondents Gregg Lorenzo, Frank
Lorenzo, and Charles Vista, a broker-dealer controlled by Gregg Lorenzo, made fraudulent
misrepresentations to several customers of Charles Vista to induce them to invest in convertible
debentures issued by a start-up waste management company called Waste2Energy Holdings, Inc.
(“W2E”).
2.
In telephone conversations with at least three Charles Vista customers, Gregg
Lorenzo attempted to convince them to purchase highly risky W2E debentures by (a) making false,
misleading, and unfounded statements designed to create the impression that the debentures were
less risky than they actually were, and (b) making unfounded positive predictions about the upside
of the investment, including the future price of W2E stock and the likelihood that the stock would
trade on the NASDAQ.
3.
Frank Lorenzo also engaged in fraudulent efforts to sell the W2E debentures to
Charles Vista customers, by sending at least two Charles Vista customers emails containing false
and/or misleading statements concerning W2E’s assets and alleged contracts.
4.
Charles Vista committed fraud through the actions of Gregg Lorenzo and Frank
Lorenzo, described above.
Respondents
5.
Gregg Lorenzo, age 30, has been the indirect owner of Charles Vista -- a formerly
registered broker-dealer – from February 2009 through the present. Gregg Lorenzo operated and
controlled Charles Vista as a broker-dealer through at least June 2013, and he was listed as a
registered representative at Charles Vista. He resides in Staten Island, New York. From April
2002 through February 2009, Gregg Lorenzo was a registered representative associated with
various other broker-dealers registered with the Commission. In 2005, Gregg Lorenzo settled civil
fraud and other charges with the State of Montana -- related to his employment at a brokerage
firm -- and agreed to withdraw his securities license in Montana for two years and pay a $35,000
fine. In February 2007, the National Association of Securities Dealers found that Gregg Lorenzo
had violated agreements with the New Jersey and Indiana securities authorities, which had
1

any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2

imposed strict supervision requirements on Gregg Lorenzo. In February 2008, Gregg Lorenzo
entered into a consent order with the Iowa Securities and Regulated Industries Bureau requiring
heightened supervision of Gregg Lorenzo and precluding him from performing supervisory
responsibilities for two years. In a July 16, 2009 Agreement and Order with the Idaho
Department of Finance, Idaho v. John Thomas Financial, et al., Docket No. 2008-7-11, the
Idaho Securities Division sanctioned Gregg Lorenzo for negligently failing to disclose the Iowa
consent order in his form U-4. The order directed Gregg Lorenzo to withdraw his application for
registration as an investment adviser representative and to pay a civil penalty of $1,250. On June
18, 2013, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) barred Gregg Lorenzo from
associating with any FINRA member firm for his refusal to appear for an on-the-record interview
(pursuant to FINRA Rule 8210) regarding a FINRA investigation of Charles Vista.
6.
Frank Lorenzo, age 52, resides in Westwood, New Jersey and is currently
registered with Hunter Wise Securities, LLC, a registered broker-dealer based in Irvine,
California. Frank Lorenzo works at the firm’s New York City office. Frank Lorenzo holds
Series 7 and 63 licenses. He began working at Mercer Capital in February 2007 and then
followed Gregg Lorenzo to John Thomas Financial and Charles Vista. Frank Lorenzo acted as
an investment banker at Mercer Capital, John Thomas Financial and Charles Vista.
7.
Charles Vista is a registered broker-dealer controlled by Gregg Lorenzo. In
February 2009, through an entity that he owned, Gregg Lorenzo purchased a registered brokerdealer shell company called DC Evans and Company LLC (“DC Evans”) and renamed it Charles
Vista, LLC. On December 16, 2009, FINRA denied Charles Vista’s application to transfer
membership from DC Evans to Charles Vista. On August 10, 2010, FINRA upheld its earlier
decision, citing Gregg Lorenzo’s regulatory history. On June 24, 2013, Charles Vista filed a Form
BDW (request for withdrawal from broker-dealer registration) with the Central Registration
Depository operated by FINRA. In 2009 and 2010, Charles Vista participated in offerings of W2E
debentures convertible to W2E stock, which is a penny stock.
Other Relevant Entities
8.
According to W2E’s SEC filings, W2E is a Delaware corporation formed in 2008
as Maven Media Holdings, Inc. (“Maven Media”). In May 2009, Maven Media’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Waste2Energy Acquisition Co., acquired Waste2Energy, Inc., a privately held
Delaware corporation that held 95% of the issued and outstanding shares of EnerWaste
International Corporation (“EWI”), a company that manufactured a so-called “Batch Oxidation
System” for converting waste into energy. EWI owned 50% of EnerWaste Europe, Ltd.
(“EWE”), a company based in Iceland that operated a waste processing facility in that country.
In April 2008, Waste2Energy, Inc. formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, EnerWaste, Inc., to
acquire the other 50% of the stock of EWE. In July 2009, Maven Media (which prior to the
acquisition of Waste2Energy, Inc. had been a shell corporation with publicly registered stock)
changed its name to Waste2Energy Holdings, Inc. Shortly thereafter, W2E’s stock began to be
quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”).

3

W2E’s Operations and Financial Condition
9.
According to W2E’s SEC filings, Waste2Energy, Inc. was incorporated in
Delaware on April 10, 2007. On August 27, 2007, Waste2Energy, Inc. filed a Form D notice that
it was engaged in a $6 million private offering of securities pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D,
17 C.F.R. § 230.506. According to its September 4, 2007 private placement memorandum,
Waste2Energy, Inc. was formed to acquire 95% of the “issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock” of EWI.
10.
According to W2E’s SEC filings, Waste2Energy, Inc. completed the EWI
acquisition in or about November 2007, thereby acquiring 50% of EWE. Through EnerWaste,
Inc., Waste2Energy acquired the remaining 50% of the stock of EWE. Waste2Energy, Inc.’s total
purchase price for EWE was $8 million, which it paid in roughly equal parts in cash, W2E stock
and a W2E promissory note.
11.
According to W2E’s SEC filings, when Waste2Energy, Inc. acquired EWE, EWE
had a contract with Ascot Environmental Ltd. (“Ascot”) to develop a waste-to-energy facility in
the Dargaval area of Dumfries, Scotland. In 2008, W2E took over this contract through its Isle
of Man subsidiary, Waste2 Energy Limited.
12.
On June 30, 2009, W2E filed a Form 8-K with the SEC that contained its first
“unaudited” public post-merger financial statements. The financial statements stated, among
other things, that, as of December 31, 2008, W2E had total assets of $13,987,764, total liabilities
of $9,563,673, and that W2E “had been operating at a substantial operating loss each year since
inception.” Of the nearly $14 million in assets as of December 31, 2008, W2E attributed over
$10 million to “intangibles” (including a $1.9 million deferred tax liability), $0.5 million to
goodwill, and $3 million to “cost and estimated earnings of billings on uncompleted contracts.”
The Form 8-K also disclosed that EWE had been placed in involuntary receivership in February
2009. The filing listed $28,171 in cash as of December 31, 2008 and further disclosed that
W2E’s current business operations were dependent on generating substantial revenues from one
customer, Ascot, which subjected W2E to “significant financial and other risks in the operation
of our business.” The anticipated revenue from the contract with Ascot, at the time it was
entered into, was less than $15 million, and by the time the Form 8-K was filed in June 2009, the
contract was operating at a net loss for W2E. Furthermore, by September 2009, W2E had
received all, or virtually all, of the payments it was entitled to under its contract with Ascot.
13.
On October 1, 2009, W2E filed an amended Form 8-K (“Form 8K/A”) and its
Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2009. The financial statements contained in the
October 1 filings included “unaudited” numbers for the period ended June 30, 2009 and,
apparently, audited numbers for the period ended March 31, 2009. For the period ended March
31, 2009, W2E reported total assets of $367,581 (including $27,360 in cash), total liabilities of
$6,676,163, and an operating loss of $1,972,637. For the period ended June 30, 2009, W2E
reported total assets of $660,408 (including $54,543 in cash), total liabilities of $3,942,356, and
an operating loss of $1.5 million. The alleged $11 million in intangible assets and goodwill that
4

W2E had reported in the Form 8-K that it filed June 30, 2009 were no longer reported as assets
on the balance sheet that appeared in its October 1, 2009 Form 10-Q and Form 8-K/A filings.
14.
W2E’s October 1, 2009 Form 8-K/A explained the complete write-off of $11
million in intangibles and goodwill as follows:
In January 2009, the Company engaged a consultant to assist in the
evaluation of the Dargavel project [for Ascot] due to continued delays and
concerns over the design and plans for the facility, as well as the progress
and ability to complete the project in accordance with the contract. The
initial plans, designs, and knowhow that were the foundation of the project
plan also served as the basis of the Technology assets we acquired with
the purchase of [EWE]. The conclusion reached was that the Company
needed to completely change the project plans, technology and controls
that would enable the company to deliver the project according to the
contract specifications. As a result, management made a determination
that the value of the assets acquired were of no value and the Company’s
IP platform would be built on a new set of plans, design specifications and
technology that was developed starting in January through the expected
conclusion of the project in late 2009. As a result, an impairment charge
in the amount of $10,538,029 was recorded to write-off the value of the
Technology.
Additionally, when the Company acquired [EWE], Goodwill was
assigned based on the value of the workforce. At the time of the Iceland
economic collapse and subsequent termination of the contract between
EWE and the company, and the signing of the new contract with another
Company subsidiary, the majority of the workforce where the value was
place did not continue on with the Dargavel project or any other efforts
supporting the continued development of the Technology and knowhow of
the business. As a result of the above, management determined that
Goodwill was impaired and an impairment in the amount of $496,594 was
recorded to write-off the value of the Goodwill.
15.
On November 16, 2009, W2E filed a Form 10-Q for the period ending September
30, 2009. In this filing, W2E reported that as of September 30, 2009, the value of all of W2E’s
assets was $905,582, its total liabilities were $6,510,247, and it had an accumulated deficit of
$23,675,381. The value of contracts receivable was listed as zero and unbilled amounts due on
uncompleted contracts was $499,857.
W2E’s $15 Million Debenture Offering
16.
From in or about September 2009 through May 2010, Gregg Lorenzo’s firm,
Charles Vista, was the exclusive placement agent for an issuance of 12% W2E debentures, with a
5

maximum issuance amount of $15 million (the “Debentures”). The Debentures were convertible to
W2E stock, which is a penny stock.
17.
Charles Vista’s financial interest in the Debentures offering was considerable.
According to documents attached to some of W2E’s SEC filings, Charles Vista was to receive
(1) a 10% “commission” on the gross proceeds of all Debentures sales; (2) a 3% “expense
allowance” on the same proceeds; (3) a consulting fee of $10,000 per month for twelve months
starting “at the initial closing” of the Debentures offering; (4) an “investment banking fee equal
to $125,000 for each $2,500,000 of Debentures sold, up to a total of $750,000”; (5) another 13%
commission/expense allowance “upon the exercise of the Warrants issued to the purchasers of
the Debentures”; and (6) a “warrant to purchase up to 4.5 %” of W2E’s outstanding shares
“proportionate to [the] amount of Debentures sold” (at a $.01 exercise price).
18.
Charles Vista sent potential investors written materials concerning W2E and the
Debentures, including a lengthy private offering memorandum (“POM”) prepared by W2E,
Charles Vista, and their respective attorneys. The POM stated that the Debentures “are highly
speculative in nature, involve a high degree of risk and should be purchased only by persons who
can afford to lose their entire investment.” The POM also listed a number of individual risks
concerning investment in the Debentures.
19.
In addition to the POM, investors received, and were required to sign, a
subscription agreement that contained risk disclosures similar to the POM.
Gregg Lorenzo’s False Statements to Investors
20.
Gregg Lorenzo personally attempted to sell the Debentures to numerous potential
investors. In his oral sales pitches to at least three potential investors, Lorenzo made false and
misleading statements designed to (i) ameliorate concerns about the investment’s downside risk
by misrepresenting W2E’s financial condition and business prospects; and (ii) make the
Debentures’ stock conversion feature appear valuable by making baseless predictions about the
future price of the company’s stock and its future listing on a major exchange.
Investor A
21.
Gregg Lorenzo spoke to Investor A several times, including in a recorded
telephone conversation on September 23, 2009. During that telephone conversation, Gregg
Lorenzo knowingly or recklessly made the following materially false and/or misleading statements
to induce Investor A to purchase the Debentures:
(a)
Discussing W2E, Gregg Lorenzo falsely told Investor A that “right
now they have a contract. They have a contract that’s totaling $100 to $200 million, but I don’t
know how fast they’re going to get that money, so I can’t really say what type of cash roll they’re
going to generate.”

6

(b)
Gregg Lorenzo made the following statements to assure Investor A that
investment in the Debentures was not as risky as the written risk disclosures had made it seem, and
that Investor A will “get [his] money back” because W2E allegedly would have “$7 million” in
cash to repay debenture holders regardless of its future revenue:
But I got to tell you this. If this is a private placement, and there
weren’t protective features in the transaction, and it wasn’t somewhat
of an insurance policy, I would tell you, you’re right, don’t do it. But
the fact that there is and you get the benefit of having a debenture and
it being senior and being in front of everything else that this company
has, accrued salary, shareholders, you name it, and it’s the only debt
the company will have on their book, I mean, I– it’s hard really -it’s hard to really put this into a very, very risky category despite
what those documents read because at the end of the day, . . . this
company is still going to have close to $7 million in the bank, and I'm
talking no revenue at all.
So I understand where you’re coming from, but there is nothing in
this market, there is nothing in this industry in my opinion with you
being a client of my firm that can do what this deal can do for you
because I’m telling you now, with our reputation on the line, me
saying this to you, if you don’t want to convert because you feel that
the market is not there, the company hasn’t executed, you are getting
your money back.
They're going to be left with these – close to or exactly the amount
of cash that they were given. Now again, I, I'm going to hold them
accountable to pay this money back out of revenue.
***
But I look at it like this. I’ll be honest with you. Based on their burn
rate, and what they're going to get left with, they're still going to
have close to $7 million in cash. If I have to raise a measly 8 million
bucks to help them at worst case scenario, I'm not worried about that.
These are the – this is the worst case scenario that I can possibly
think of. I just – I just don't see that happening. I, you know, I, I’m
sorry. And if they do, I am prepared as the chairman of Charles
Vista to make sure that the investors get paid back.
***
You know, the odds of you being successful are, are highly likely.
***
7

I also want you to know that this is a very, very strong transaction.
***
I will make sure that you get paid back your money in this
transaction. I don't believe that you will even take back your money.
I have full confidence you will convert this note into stock at a dollar
because the stock will be trading at a significant premium with
liquidity because the company has executed their business plan.
***

And you're going to have a year to watch it for yourself. I don't have
to say anything. The proof will be in the pudding, and you'll be able
to decide what you want to do. It's like, it's like being able to place a
bet and making a decision if you want to keep that bet a year from
now.
***
But you are getting your money back, and you’re going to get your
final interest payment, and you are getting your warrants up front,
and you’ll be able to decide if you want to keep going. That [other]
stock cannot offer you that. No public stock can offer you that. It’s
just not out there.
(c)
During the September 23, 2009 telephone call with Investor A, Gregg
Lorenzo also made the following baseless prediction regarding W2E’s alleged future listing on
NASDAQ: “I believe [W2E] will be a NASDAQ trading stock within 12 months. I believe they
will meet the listing requirements.”
(d)
On the same call, Gregg Lorenzo also made equally baseless statements
concerning the future price of W2E’s stock, into which the Debentures could be converted. He
told Investor A that “I have full confidence you will convert this note into stock at a dollar because
the stock will be trading at a significant premium with liquidity because [W2E] has executed their
business plan.” Later in the call, while trying to convince Investor A to invest $75,000 more than
he already had decided to invest in the Debentures, Gregg Lorenzo stated that an additional
$75,000 means “150,000 more shares in a company that could potentially be $5 to $10 a share
within 12 months. And that’s what I’m looking at. You’re giving up on that, and I just don’t want
you to do that. 150,000 shares at $5 is almost a million dollars to you. It’s 700, it’s close to
$750,000.”
(e)
Gregg Lorenzo also told Investor A on September 23, 2009 that he was in
possession of favorable non-public information concerning W2E, stating: “I can tell you things
8

that are not even public yet that I shouldn’t tell you, but it’s not going to make a difference.
You’re going to want to see these things happen.”
(f)
Finally, Lorenzo falsely told Investor A on September 23, 2009 that the
“debenture [was] senior and being in front of everything else that [W2E] has, accrued salary,
shareholders, you name it, and it’s the only debt the company will have on their book.”
22.
Gregg Lorenzo had no reasonable basis for making the statements set forth in
paragraph 21 above because, as he knew or recklessly disregarded:
(a)
W2E never had a contract for “$100 to $200 million”; its only substantial
contract, with Ascot, was worth less than $15 million at the outset, and as of September 23,
2009, when Lorenzo had the call with Investor A, W2E already had received all, or virtually all,
payments due under that contract.
(b)
W2E’s last public filing prior to September 23, 2009 -- its May 28, 2009
Form 8-K -- reported, not that the company had “$7 million in the bank” as Lorenzo told
Investor A, but that (i) as of December 31, 2008, W2E had only $28,171 in cash; and (ii) as of
May 28, 2009, the company had only $194,369 in cash. Furthermore, W2E’s Form 10-Q for the
period that ended June 30, 2009 (filed October 1, 2009) reported that the company had only
$54,543 in cash and less than $700,000 in total assets; and W2E’s Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2009 (filed November 16, 2009) reported total assets of $905,582, total
liabilities of $6,510,247, an accumulated deficit of $23,675,381, contracts receivable valued at
zero, and unbilled amounts due on uncompleted contracts at $499,857.
(c) and (d) W2E was an extremely speculative stock — it was a start-up company
at an early stage of development, and its financial condition was extremely precarious.
Furthermore, on September 23, 2009 — the day that Gregg Lorenzo made his stock price and
NASDAQ listing predictions to Investor A — W2E filed a Form 8-K reporting that on August
20, 2009, FINRA had notified the company that if it did not file a delinquent Form 10-Q by
September 21, its stock could be de-listed from the OTCBB, a trading venue with much less
demanding listing requirements than the NASDAQ. In addition, the POM reported that (1) the
“sole member of our board of directors was a defendant in prior litigation arising [sic] alleging
violation of the Federal Securities laws, which may prevent or make more difficult listing on a
national exchange and/or NASDAQ”; and, after further describing the litigation, (2) “[t]here can
be no assurance that [the Director’s] actions and/or involvement in the prior litigation will not
negatively impact and/or prevent [W2E’s] ability to be listed on an exchange and/or NASDAQ,
even if [W2E] were to meet such listing qualifications, which it will not for the foreseeable
future.”
(e)
No “non-public information concerning W2E” existed, and none of W2E’s
public statements after September 23, 2009 indicate that any such undisclosed favorable
information about the company existed on or around September 23, 2009.

9

(f)
As Gregg Lorenzo knew, as of September 23, 2009, W2E had millions of
dollars in debt on its books that was senior to the debt W2E was issuing through the Debentures
offering.
23.
On September 25, 2009 and October 1, 2009, Investor A invested a total of
$200,000 in the Debentures.
Investor B
24.
In or about August, 2009, Gregg Lorenzo spoke to Investor B concerning the
Debentures. During his conversations with Investor B, Lorenzo knowingly or recklessly falsely
told investor B that he would make several times his money if he invested in the Debentures.
25.
Debentures.

After speaking to Gregg Lorenzo, Investor B invested $200,000 in the

Investor C
26.
In or about April and May 2010, Gregg Lorenzo made the following false or
misleading statements to Investor C, for which there was no reasonable basis. He told Investor C
that:
(a)
If he invested in the Debentures, Investor C was guaranteed to get the principal
invested in the Debentures back plus interest after one year; and
(b)
W2E would be doing very well in a year, at which point Investor C would have
the option to convert the Debentures into W2E stock.
27.
After speaking to Gregg Lorenzo, Investor C invested a total of $125,000 in the
Debentures: $25,000 on April 1, 2010 and $100,000 on May 12, 2010.
The Fraudulent Emails to Investors
28.
As stated in paragraphs 13-14 above, on October 1, 2009, W2E filed an
amended Form 8-K and its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2009. Those filings stated
that W2E had written off almost all of its previously-reported assets (totaling approximately $14
million) as of June 30, 2009, consisting primarily of $11 million in “intangibles” and “goodwill.”
29.
On October 1 and the morning of October 2, Frank Lorenzo notified Charles
Vista’s brokers (including Gregg Lorenzo) by email of W2E’s October 1, 2009 filings and
included links in his email to the W2E filings on the SEC’s website.
30.
On October 2, 2009, Frank Lorenzo’s assistant, acting on behalf of, and at the
direction of, either Frank Lorenzo or Gregg Lorenzo, or both, sent emails to Investor B and another
10

Charles Vista client with the subject-heading “W2E Debenture Deal Points.” The emails, designed
to solicit those clients’ investments in the Debentures, purported to “summarize several key points
of the Waste2Energy Holdings, Inc. Debenture Offering,” and contained the following false and/or
misleading statements concerning W2E:
There are 3 layers of protection:
(I)
(II)
(III)

The Company has over $10 mm in confirmed assets
The Company has purchase orders and LOI’s [letters of intent] for over $43
mm in orders
Charles Vista has agreed to raise additional monies to repay these
Debenture holders (if necessary)

31.
The first statement was false because, by October 1, 2009, W2E had written off
nearly all of its assets, and had no “$10 mm in confirmed assets.”
32.
The second statement was misleading because, as of October 1, 2009, W2E had only
a single, non-binding, letter of intent for $43 million and negligible “purchase orders.”
33.
The third statement was misleading because, when it was made, it was far from
certain that W2E could sell the full $15 million in Debentures it was offering, much less “raise
additional monies to repay [those] Debenture holders.”
34.
At the time that Frank and/or Gregg Lorenzo caused Charles Vista to send the
October 2, 2009 emails to potential W2E investors, they each knew, or recklessly disregarded,
that the statements excerpted in paragraph 30 above were false and/or misleading statements
about W2E.
35.
On October 5, 2009, Frank Lorenzo and Gregg Lorenzo received an email authored
by the Chief Financial Officer of W2E, Craig Brown, which expressly informed them of the
“write-off of all of [W2E’s] intangible assets . . . of about $11 million.”
36.
On October 14, 2009, Frank Lorenzo sent two additional emails to Charles Vista
customers that contained the very same false and misleading statements that were in the October 2,
2009 emails. Frank Lorenzo sent the October 14 emails to solicit investments in the Debentures.
37.
At the time Frank Lorenzo sent the October 14 emails, he knew, or recklessly

the purchase or sale of any penny stock.

C.
Any reapplication for association by Gregg Lorenzo will be subject to the
applicable laws and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned
upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the
following: (a) any disgorgement ordered against Gregg Lorenzo, whether or not the Commission
has fully or partially waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to

organization arbitration award to a customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as

order.
D.
Respondents Gregg Lorenzo and Charles Vista shall, within three business days
of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement of $130,000 and prejudgment interest of $20,000
(“Disgorgement Payment”) to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If timely payment is
not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600.

Exchange Commission. If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant
to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.

pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717.
G.
Payment of the Disgorgement Payment, the Lorenzo Penalty Payment, and the
Charles Vista Penalty Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

13

(1)

the Settling Respondents may make direct payment from a bank account
via Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(2)

the Settling Respondents may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s
check, or United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities
and Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:
Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying the
paying Respondent as a respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Robert J.
Keyes, Associate Regional Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 3 World Financial Center, Rm. 400, New York, N.Y. 10281-1022.
H.
Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, a Fair
Fund is created for the disgorgement, interest and penalties referenced in paragraphs IV.D., IV.E.,
and IV.F. above. Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts
ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties
paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent
effect of the civil penalty, the Settling Respondents agree that in any Related Investor Action,
they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of the Settling Respondents’ payment
of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action
grants such a Penalty Offset, the Settling Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after
entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action
and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the United States Treasury or to a Fair Fund, as the
Commission directs. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall
not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For
purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private damages action brought
against the Settling Respondents by or on behalf of one or more investors based on substantially
the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this proceeding.
