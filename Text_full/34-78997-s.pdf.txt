Battery and Energy Storage System Company Settles with SEC Regarding Reporting and
Internal Controls Violations
September 29, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that Altair
Nanotechnologies, Inc. (“Altair”) has agreed to settle reporting and internal controls charges.
An SEC investigation found that in late 2013, Altair, a manufacturer of nano lithium titanate
batteries and energy storage systems, began to move its operations from the United States to
China. This was accompanied by a number of changes in Altair’s management and its financial
reporting practices. Altair’s independent auditor, Crowe Horwath LLP, began an audit for fiscal
year 2013 but resigned as of August 28, 2014 because it could not complete the audit due to
material weaknesses in Altair’s internal control over financial reporting relating to the transfer of
operations to China. In March 2015, Altair announced that its financial statements for the third
quarter of fiscal year 2013 should no longer be relied upon. Even though Altair ultimately
appointed a new auditor, it became delinquent in its financial reporting. To date, Altair has not
filed a Form 10-K for fiscal year 2013, or any Forms 10-K or Forms 10-Q for any annual or
quarterly financial reporting period thereafter.
The SEC’s orders instituting settled administrative proceedings find that Altair violated the
reporting and internal accounting controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Without admitting or denying the findings in the SEC’s orders, Altair agreed to a cease-anddesist order, a $250,000 penalty, and undertakings which require Altair to become current in its
financial reporting through the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, by no later than 5:30
p.m. ET on November 15, 2016. If Altair fails to comply with the undertakings, then the
registration of each class of its securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act
will be revoked pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Marisa G. Westervelt and Lorraine L. Pearson and
supervised by Victoria A. Levin, all of the Los Angeles Regional Office.
