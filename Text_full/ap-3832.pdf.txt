In the Matter of
ORDER
JOSEPH J. FOX

On September 8, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings against Respondent, directing the determination of what, if any, nonfinancial remedial sanctions under Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were
in the public interest based on Respondent’s violations of Section 5(a) and (c) of the Securities
Act of 1933. I issued an initial decision on April 25, 2016, barring Respondent from the
securities industry for a period of five years. Joseph J. Fox, Initial Decision Release No. 1004,
2016 SEC LEXIS 1515.
On May 6, 2016, Respondent filed a motion to correct manifest error pursuant to Rule of
Practice 111(h), 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). Rule 111 provides that “[a]ny motion to correct must
be filed within ten days of the initial decision.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). Respondent’s motion
was filed eleven days after the initial decision was issued. However, according to information
provided by the Office of the Secretary, Respondent was served with the decision by certified
mail. The Rules of Practice therefore afforded him an additional three days in which to file his
motion to correct, which I accordingly find was timely. 17 C.F.R. § 201.160(b).
The Rules of Practice prohibit motions exceeding 7,000 words, and they require that any
motion longer than fifteen pages be accompanied by a certificate attesting that it complies with
this limitation. 17 C.F.R. § 201.154(c). Respondent’s motion is twenty-three pages long and
contains no such certificate; the motion is approximately 3,000 words over the page limit. Due
to his pro se status, I will nonetheless accept the motion as proper and consider it in its entirety.
Attached to Respondent’s motion are several exhibits containing evidence not previously
introduced in this proceeding. My authority at this stage of the proceeding is limited – as the
Commission has observed, “once the initial decision is issued, our rules largely divest the law
judge of authority over the proceedings.” Alchemy Ventures, Inc., Exchange Act Release No.
70708, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3459, at *13 (Oct. 17, 2013). And while the Rules of Practice permit
the Commission to allow the submission of additional evidence, such a request must “show with
particularity that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for

failure to adduce such evidence previously.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.452. Respondent provides no
explanation for his failure to submit the evidence attached to his motion prior to the issuance of
the initial decision. Although Respondent’s new evidence is not properly part of the record, in
view of his pro se status, I will consider it in determining whether there were any manifest errors
in the initial decision. See Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining a manifest error as
one that is “plain and indisputable, and that amounts to a complete disregard of . . . the credible
evidence in the record.” (emphasis added)).
Finally, at this time I do not require any briefing from the Division of Enforcement. The
Division should not file a brief in opposition to Respondent’s motion unless instructed to do so in
a future order.
SO ORDERED.
