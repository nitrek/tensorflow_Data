EXTENSION ORDER

The Respondent has requested an extension of time until July, 2016 to file his
opening brief in this matter. FINRA does not object but requests the same extension of
time in keeping with the Commission’s order of simultaneous briefing. Extensions of
time are disfavored. It appears appropriate, however, to grant the Respondent’s request
for good cause shown. Therefore,
It is ORDERED that the time for filing opening briefs, not to exceed 10 pages, is
extended to July 1, 2016. The time for filing responsive briefs, not to exceed 7 pages, is
extended to July 8, 2016.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Lynn M. Powalski
Deputy Secretary
