File No. 3-16509

In the Matter of
EDWARD M. DASPIN, a/k/a “EDWARD (ED) MICHAEL”;
LUIGI AGOSTINI; and
LAWRENCE R. LUX

ORDER

When the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated this proceeding in April 2015, it
related to three Respondents: Edward M. Daspin, Luigi Agostini, and Lawrence R. Lux. Lux
settled with the Commission on October 16, 2015. Edward M. Daspin, Securities Act of 1933
Release No. 9963, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4287. On March 8, 2016, I found Daspin in default,
Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3683, 2016 SEC LEXIS 886, and on
March 16, 2016, I denied his request to set aside that finding, Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3713, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1000. I issued an initial decision with respect to
Daspin on August 23, 2016. Edward M. Daspin, Initial Decision Release No. 1051, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 2928. The proceeding as to Agostini was stayed last week pending settlement. Edward
M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4146, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3401 (ALJ Sept. 12,
2016).
Since I issued the initial decision, Daspin has submitted a number of motions.1 Because I
have issued an initial decision as to Daspin, the only motion that Daspin could properly have
filed with me would have been a motion filed by September 2, 2016, to correct manifest error in
the initial decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h); Edward M. Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2928, at
*82 (initial decision of August 23, 2016, noting such motion must be filed within ten days of
initial decision). Because Daspin has not timely filed any such motion nor sought to correct any
error in the initial decision—indeed he never mentions it in any of his motions—his motions are
all DENIED insofar as they are directed to me. The motions must be adjudicated, if at all, by the
1

These motions include: (1) a September 1, 2016 motion (a) to “dissolve or vacate” the
March 8, 2016 default order and (b) supporting Agostini’s discovery requests; (2) a September 7,
2016 motion or declaration purporting to support Agostini’s discovery requests; (3) a September
12, 2016 motion to correct a manifest error in the March 8, 2016 default order; and (4) a
September 15, 2016 “motion under Rule 111 [to] correct a manifest error” in an order issued
September 8, 2016, ruling on Agostini’s discovery request.

Commission. Any future motion, filing, or request that Daspin may make must be addressed to
the Commission and will not be adjudicated by me absent Commission order. See Edward M.
Daspin, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3401, at *1 n.1.
