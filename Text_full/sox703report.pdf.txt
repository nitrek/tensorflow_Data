REPORT OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION: SECTION
703 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
STUDY AND REPORT ON VIOLATIONS BY SECURITIES PROFESSIONALS
Executive Summary
This is a report by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
“Commission”) on the number of securities professionals who have aided and abetted or
were primary violators of the Federal securities laws in calendar years 1998, 1999, 2000
and 2001. Section 703 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”),
enacted on July 30, 2002, directed the SEC to conduct a study on securities professionals
who have been found to be violators and to submit a report to Congress on the study by
January 26, 2003. Section 703(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act defines securities
professionals as “public accountants, public accounting firms, investment bankers,
investment advisers, brokers, dealers, attorneys, and other securities professionals
practicing before the Commission.” This report reviews the scope and methodology of
the study and summarizes the resultant data.
The study reveals that, during the four-year period, 1,596 securities professionals
were found to have aided and abetted violations of and/or violated the Federal securities
laws in actions brought by the SEC. An additional 117 securities professionals, while not
violating the Federal securities laws, are included in the study because they either failed
to reasonably supervise employees subject to their supervision or engaged in improper
professional conduct. The securities professionals most frequently found to have violated
and/or aided and abetted the Federal securities laws were individuals associated with
broker-dealers, such as registered representatives or branch managers (788), followed by
broker-dealer firms (236) and individuals associated with investment advisers (172). The
most common types of cases against these securities professionals involved securities
offerings (385), fraud against broker-dealer customers (323), and investment adviser
violations (228). The most frequently ordered sanctions were permanent injunctions
(782), civil monetary penalties (730), disgorgement (673), permanent cease-and-desist
orders (613), and bars from association with broker-dealers (434).
The most frequently violated sections of the Federal securities laws were the
antifraud provisions: Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (965) and Section 17(a)
of the Securities Act of 1933 (741). The next most frequently violated provisions
involved violations of the securities registration provisions (Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the
Securities Act) (302 and 290, respectively) and broker-dealer registration provisions
(Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act) (265). Securities professionals were much more
likely to have been found principal violators (1,299) than aiders and abettors (13). Two
hundred and eighty four (284) securities professionals were charged as both a principal
violator and an aider and abettor.

REPORT OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION: SECTION
703 OF SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
STUDY AND REPORT ON VIOLATIONS BY SECURITIES PROFESSIONALS
Introduction
This is a report by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
“Commission”) on the number of securities professionals who were aiders and abettors or
primary violators of the Federal securities laws in calendar years 1998, 1999, 2000 and
2001. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), enacted on July 30,
2002, directed the SEC to conduct a study on securities professionals who have been
found to be violators and to submit a report to Congress on the study by January 26,
2003. This report reviews the scope and methodology of the study and summarizes the
resultant data.
Scope
Section 703 defines the scope of the study to include securities professionals who
have been found to have aided and abetted or who were primary violators of the Federal
securities laws, including rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, for the years 1998
through 2001.1 The Act defines securities professionals as “public accountants, public
accounting firms, investment bankers, investment advisers, brokers, dealers, attorneys,
and other securities professionals practicing before the Commission.” Section 703(a)(1)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.2 The study further defines “other securities professionals
practicing before the Commission” to include: individuals associated with a broker or
dealer, such as registered representatives and branch managers; individuals associated
with an investment adviser or investment company; transfer agents; stock promoters;3
and chief or principal financial officers of public companies.4 Although many persons
1

A majority of cases brought by the Commission are resolved through settlements. Generally, defendants
and respondents are permitted to settle with the Commission without admitting or denying the substantive
allegations. Therefore, in settled injunctive actions, there are no findings of violations by the court. On the
other hand, in settled administrative proceedings, there are Commission findings of violations, even though
the settling respondent neither admits nor denies those findings. Nevertheless, for purposes of the study,
settling securities professionals in both injunctive actions and administrative proceedings are included.
2
As of December 2002, there were approximately 8,000 broker-dealers employing approximately 660,000
registered representatives. In addition, as of December 2002, there were approximately 7,700 investment
advisers registered with the SEC, and over 32,000 investment company portfolios. This information was
compiled by the Division of Market Regulation, the Division of Investment Management, and the Office of
Compliance Inspections and Examinations from various sources, including EDGAR, CRD and IARD
(maintained by the NASD), and the Investment Company Institute.
3
The term “stock promoter” is not defined within the Federal securities laws. This study includes
individuals and entities described in public SEC documents as promoters or who have violated the antitouting provisions of the Federal securities laws (Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933).
4
The study includes Chief Financial Officers and Principal Financial Officers since they would ordinarily
be the individuals in a corporation who are deemed to be “practicing before the Commission” by virtue of
their responsibility for SEC filings. It does not include any other corporate officers or directors, with the

2

could fit into more than one securities professional category, for purposes of this study,
each individual is classified as only one type of professional.5 In addition, the study
includes unregistered individuals and firms that violated the broker-dealer, investment
adviser, or investment company registration provisions of the Federal securities laws.
With respect to each violator, Sections 703(2) and (3) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
specify that the study describe the Federal securities laws violations committed,
including:
•

The specific provision(s) of the securities laws violated;

•

The specific disciplinary sanctions imposed;

•

Occurrences of multiple violations by the same person(s); and

•

The amount of disgorgement, restitution, penalties or fines assessed and
collected.

Although the specific language of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act limits the study to
“aiders or abettors” and “primary violators,” 6 certain SEC actions against industry
professionals and entities do not fall neatly within these two categories, but are included
in the study because they are within the spirit of the Act. For example, the SEC brings
actions against branch managers and other supervisors at broker-dealer and investment
advisory firms who fail to reasonably supervise their employees who commit violations.
The Commission also brings failure to supervise actions against the firms themselves.
“Failure to supervise,” however, does not constitute a violation in and of itself of the
securities laws.7 These cases are included as part of the study because failure to
supervise actions are an important part of the SEC’s enforcement program in that the
threat of a failure to supervise action creates incentives for firms to act to prevent illegal
activity by their employees before investors are harmed.
Additionally, each year the SEC files cases against accountants who practice
before the Commission who have engaged in improper professional conduct or who have
otherwise engaged in misconduct such that they should be prohibited, either temporarily

exception of 28 other non-CFO employees of public companies who were accountants and were sanctioned
pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
5
The category chosen was based on the nature of the case and the professionals’ violations. For instance, if
a registered representative is also associated with an investment adviser, and the violations were committed
in his capacity as a registered representative, that person would be categorized for purposes of the study as
a registered representative.
6
For purposes of this study, a securities professional who is found to have “caused” a violation of the
Federal securities laws in a cease-and-desist proceeding is deemed to be a primary violator. See Section 8A
of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 9(f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, and Section 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
7
Failure to supervise actions are authorized under Sections 15(b)(4) and (6) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and Sections 203(e)(6) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

or permanently, from practicing before the Commission.8 Rule 102(e) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice provides the Commission with a mechanism to ensure
that professionals who practice before the Commission perform their duties diligently and
with a reasonable degree of competence. While certain bases for bringing Rule 102(e)
actions do not involve violations of the Federal securities laws, such as engaging in
improper professional conduct, the study nevertheless includes all Rule 102(e) actions for
the relevant period because they involve securities professionals and are an integral part
of the SEC’s enforcement program.
Section 703 requires the Commission to review information from January 1, 1998
to December 31, 2001. Since the Study focuses on securities professionals who “have
been found” to have violated the law,9 the Commission’s review was limited to only
those actions that reached resolution during the stated time period.10 Many SEC actions
filed in a particular year may not settle or be litigated to final resolution until two or more
years later. The Study did not include such pending cases but rather included only those
actions that reached finality between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2001, including
those actions filed prior to 1998.
Methodology
In order to gather and review the information required by Section 703, a computer
database was designed to compile, organize, and present the data in a manageable form.
To gather the information, several SEC attorneys reviewed the following publiclyavailable documents:11
•
1,330 Commission orders
•
1,676 Litigation Releases
•
79 Initial Decisions
•
126 Commission Opinions
The data gathered from the document review was entered into the database. Quality
control was performed on the database and the final reports were run.
8

See Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)]. Rule 102(e) sets forth
several bases for bringing an action, including i) not possessing the requisite qualifications to represent
others; ii) to be lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged in unethical or improper professional
conduct; iii) to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the
Federal securities laws; iv) the revocation or suspension of a state professional license; v) a conviction of a
felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; vi) a permanent injunction from violating or aiding and
abetting the violation of the Federal securities laws, or vii) a finding by a court or the SEC that the person
violated or aided and abetted the violation of the Federal securities laws. During the four year period of the
study, of the 127 Rule 102(e) actions, 43 were based on either improper professional conduct or a criminal
conviction and therefore did not involve a violation of the Federal securities laws. The remaining 84 were
based either on a willful violation or an injunction from future violations of the Federal securities laws.
9
Securities professionals named as relief defendants only are not included in the study.
10
In 1998, 433 resolutions were reached against securities professionals, 523 in 1999, 413 in 2000, and 344
in 2001. The study did not reach any conclusions as to the reasons for the lower numbers in the later years
of the study.
11
In addition to the publicly-available documents, the study relied on certain other internal information
sources.

4

While not specifically called for by Section 703, each action against a securities
professional was categorized according to the type of misconduct, such as insider trading,
market manipulation, securities offering, investment adviser violations,12 etc. While
many cases fell within more than one category, each case was given only a single
(principal) category based on the facts of the case and the violations charged. Most of
these categories describe the particular type of fraud committed by the securities
professional.
The methodology used by the study with respect to monetary sanctions and
collections relied primarily on information obtained from the Commission's
Disgorgement Payment Tracking System (DPTS). The DPTS, managed by the Office of
the Secretary, tracks collections of penalties and disgorgement ordered in Commission
enforcement actions. For a detailed description of the SEC’s disgorgement, penalties and
collections program, please refer to the SEC’s report titled Report Pursuant to Section
308(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Results
The Study reveals the following:
Numbers of Violators
As required by Section 703(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for the
period from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001, the SEC concluded
enforcement actions against 1,713 securities professionals:
•

13 securities professionals were found to have aided and abetted a violation of the
Federal securities laws but were not found to have committed a primary violation
of those laws.

•

1,299 securities professionals were found to have committed primary violations of
the Federal securities laws.

•

284 securities professionals were found to have committed both aiding and
abetting and primary violations of the Federal securities laws.

•

74 securities professionals failed to reasonably supervise individuals under their
supervision.

12

Although the study does not break out the different types of investment adviser violations, a substantial
majority of such violations involve fraud against investment adviser clients. Other investment adviser
violations include registration, reporting, and books and records violations.

•

43 securities professionals were prohibited from practicing before the
Commission pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice for
engaging in improper professional conduct or based on a criminal conviction.13

In many instances, securities professionals had multiple sanctions ordered against them.
This table does not include relief obtained in failure to supervise actions. Failure to supervise data can be
found in Appendix D.
16
The Commission does not seek the imposition of penalties in all instances where one is warranted due to,
among other reasons, the financial condition of the securities professional and criminal sanctions ordered in
parallel criminal proceedings.
17
This does not include suspensions from association with broker-dealers. Suspensions from association
are for 12 months or less while bars from association are for one year or more. During the period of the
study, there were 122 suspensions from association with broker-dealers against securities professionals.
18
This does not include suspensions from association with investment advisers. Suspensions from
association are for 12 months or less while bars are for one year or more. During the period of the study,
there were 73 suspensions from association with investment advisers against securities professionals.

Multiple Violations
Of the 1,596 securities professionals found to have aided and abetted or
committed a primary violation of the Federal securities laws, 1,162 were found to have
violated more than one statute, rule or regulation. This information is required by Section
703(a)(2)(C) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Disgorgement and Penalties
Disgorgement in the amount of $799,355,572 was assessed against 555 securities
professionals. $145,018,556 of this disgorgement was waived and, to date, $167,044,188
has been collected. The remaining $487,292,828 has not been collected.19 Civil
penalties in the amount of $225,963,700 were assessed against 612 securities
professionals. To date, $77,722,355 of the ordered civil penalties have been collected.
The remaining $148,241,345 has not been collected.20 This information is required by
Section 703(a)(3) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Conclusion
During the four-year period of the study, 1,596 securities professionals were
found to have aided and abetted violations of and/or violated the Federal securities laws.
Most of these securities professionals were charged solely as primary violators or as both
primary violators and aiders and abettors. Only 13 of these 1,596 securities professionals
were charged solely as aiders and abettors. The most common type of securities
professionals against whom the SEC brought actions were individuals associated with
broker-dealers such as registered representatives and branch managers. The most
common types of cases involved securities offerings and fraud against broker-dealer
customers. The most prevalent sanctions ordered were permanent injunctions, civil
penalties, disgorgement, and bars from association with broker-dealers. The most
frequently violated sections of the Federal securities laws were the general antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

19

The staff is engaging in ongoing collection efforts with respect to some of the uncollected disgorgement
and penalties.
20
One hundred and eighteen (118) securities professionals in the study were ordered to pay disgorgement
and/or penalties on a joint and several basis with co-defendants or co-respondents. Because many of these
co-defendants and co-respondents are not securities professionals, amounts ordered against and collected
from these 118 securities professionals are not included in the above disgorgement and penalty amounts
because their inclusion would overstate the amounts ordered. For instance, if a securities professional were
ordered to disgorge $10 million jointly and severally with 4 non-securities professionals, the reported
amounts would be skewed if the study reported that the single securities professional had been ordered to
pay $10 million. Because of this and various other complicating factors, the study does not include
amounts relating to securities professionals against whom a penalty or disgorgement amount was ordered
on a joint and several basis.
