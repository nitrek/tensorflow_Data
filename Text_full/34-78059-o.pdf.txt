Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
June 14, 2016

In the Matter of
Enterprise Energy, Inc.,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) that the
public interest and the protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the
securities of Enterprise Energy, Inc. (CIK No. 0001587285) because of recent, unusual
and unexplained market activity and potentially manipulative transactions in the
company’s stock. Enterprise Energy, Inc. is a Nevada corporation with its principal place
of business listed as Las Vegas, Nevada, with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously
“Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the ticker symbol EYGY.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of Enterprise Energy, Inc. is
suspended for the period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on June 14, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT
on June 27, 2016.
By the Commission.
