ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on March 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated the
antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral
loan obligation funds (known as the Zohar Funds) by reporting misleading values for the assets
held by the funds and failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s
undisclosed approach to categorization of assets. The proceeding was stayed by order of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit between September 17, 2015, and June 2016. See
Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 9970, at *37 (2d Cir. June 1, 2016); Tilton v.
SEC, No. 15-2103, ECF Nos. 76, 125. The hearing is currently scheduled to commence on
October 24, 2016.
Under consideration are several motions in limine filed by Respondents, seeking to
exclude various categories of potential evidence from the record, and responsive pleadings.
Specifically, they are motions to:
(1) Preclude Testimony and Evidence Regarding the Subjective States of Mind of
Zohar Fund Investors (August 22, 2016);
(2) Preclude Evidence Concerning Recklessness and Negligence and to Require
the Division to Prove Intentional Misconduct (August 26, 2016);
(3) Exclude Transcripts of Investigative Testimony, including Division Exhibits
194 Through 206 (September 1, 2016);
(4) Exclude the Zohar CDO 2003-1, LLC, et al., v. Patriarch Partners, LLC, et
al., Case No. 12247-VCS (Del. Ch. Aug. 9 & 10, 2016) Trial Transcripts Marked
Division Exhibits 207 and 208 (September 2, 2016);
(5) Strike as Inadmissible, in Whole or in Part, Certain Lay Opinion Testimony
(September 6, 2016);

(6) Exclude Division Exhibits 71 Through 73 (Ms. Tilton’s Testimony,
Declaration, and Affidavit from Other Proceedings) (September 12, 2016);
(7) Preclude the Admission of Any Portions of Investigative Testimony
Transcripts without the Introduction of Corresponding Portions of Audio
Recordings of the Testimony, and to Exclude Transcripts for which Audio
Recordings were not Preserved and Produced (September 12, 2016);
(8) Preclude the Introduction of Division Exhibits 118-123 (Letters from
Respondents’ Counsel) (September 12, 2016); and
(9) Preclude the Division from Introducing into Evidence Exhibits or Portions of
Exhibits Containing Unreliable Hearsay, Including (but not Limited to) Exhibits
129, 140, 142, 174, 184, and 190 (September 12, 2016).
General Considerations
The threshold for admissibility of evidence in Commission proceedings is quite low. See
Herbert Moskowitz, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 45609, 2002 SEC LEXIS 693,
at *46 n.68 (Mar. 21, 2002) (granting the Division’s motion to admit in evidence an indictment
of respondent’s brother, “while noting the limited relevance and utility of the indictment” to the
proceeding and reminding administrative law judges to “be inclusive in making evidentiary
determinations”); City of Anaheim, Exchange Act Release No. 42140, 1999 SEC LEXIS 2421, at
*4-5 & nn.5-7 (Nov. 16, 1999). To the extent that Respondents reference the Federal Rules of
Evidence (FRE) in their motions to exclude evidence, the Commission has stated many times
that the FRE are not applicable in its administrative proceedings. See Del Mar Fin. Servs., Inc.,
Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 8314, 2003 SEC LEXIS 2538, at *28 (Oct. 24, 2003), recons.
denied, Securities Act Release No. 8386, 2004 SEC LEXIS 331 (Feb. 17, 2004); see also City of
Anaheim, 1999 SEC LEXIS 2421, at *4 (“The Federal Rules of Evidence are designed for juries
and do not apply to administrative adjudications. Administrative agencies such as the
Commission are more expert fact-finders, less prone to undue prejudice, and better able to weigh
complex and potentially misleading evidence than are juries. Our law judges should be inclusive
in making evidentiary determinations.” (footnotes omitted)); see also Amendments to the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, 81 Fed. Reg. 50212, 50226-27 (July 29, 2016) (explicitly
rejecting FRE as to hearsay).
Further, the Commission’s policy concerning the admissibility of investigative testimony
is quite expansive. See Del Mar Fin. Servs., Inc., 2003 SEC LEXIS 2538, at *27-30 (admitting
investigative testimony of a respondent, who was unavailable by virtue of “taking the Fifth,” for
use against other respondents whose interests were adverse to his, while acknowledging that the
testimony was “self-serving and unreliable”). However, if either party wishes to offer
investigative testimony in evidence, it should offer specific portions, not an entire transcript. See
id. at *30.
Specific Motions
(1) Motion to Preclude Testimony and Evidence Regarding the Subjective States of
Mind of Zohar Fund Investors. Respondents ask that the Division be precluded from
introducing evidence of the subjective states of mind of investors in the funds to which
2

Respondents served as investment advisers, including what investors thought about
Respondents’ intent or state of mind or the materiality of particular disclosures or nondisclosures. In response, the Division states that it does not anticipate asking investor witnesses
about Respondents’ intent or state of mind but rather about the details of their investment,
including how Respondents’ conduct compared with their representations and what an investor
viewed as important in making his decision to invest. The Division will not be precluded from
offering such proposed evidence. Materiality, of course, is a mixed question of law and fact to
be decided by the undersigned.
(2) Motion to Preclude Evidence Concerning Recklessness and Negligence and to
Require the Division to Prove Intentional Misconduct. Respondents argue that only
“intentional misconduct” – and not “evidence relating to, or in support of, recklessness or
negligence standards of liability” – is within the scope of the OIP. This argument is not well
taken and is, in fact, frivolous. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated Sections 206(1),
206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act. Scienter is required to establish violations of Section
206(1) of the Advisers Act. SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 641 & n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1992).
Recklessness can satisfy the scienter requirement. See David Disner, Exchange Act Release No.
38234, 1997 SEC LEXIS 258, at *14-15 & n.20 (Feb. 4, 1997); see also SEC v. Steadman, 967
F.2d at 641-42; Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., 914 F.2d 1564, 1568-69 (9th Cir. 1990).
Scienter is not required to establish a violation of Section 206(2) or 206(4) of the Advisers Act; a
showing of negligence is adequate. See SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S.
180, 195 (1963); SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d at 643 & n.5; Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126,
1132-34 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981).
(3), (4), (6) Motions to Exclude: Transcripts of Investigative Testimony, including
Division Exhibits 194 Through 206; the Zohar CDO 2003-1, LLC, et al., v. Patriarch
Partners, LLC, et al., Case No. 12247-VCS (Del. Ch. Aug. 9 & 10, 2016) Trial Transcripts
Marked Division Exhibits 207 and 208; Division Exhibits 71 Through 73 (Ms. Tilton’s
Testimony, Declaration, and Affidavit from Other Proceedings). Respondents request that
transcripts of investigative testimony and testimony from other proceedings be excluded. Except
for the Tilton materials, the Division disavows any intention to introduce these materials
wholesale and states that it intends to use them to impeach or to refresh recollection. The
Division is reminded that it must comply with the requirements of 17 C.F.R. § 201.235 should it
wish to introduce prior sworn statements of non-party individuals who are unavailable because
of death, imprisonment, sickness, or other conditions specified in the rule. The Division argues
that the Tilton materials are admissible as party admissions. The Division should specify the
portions of the Tilton materials that it proposes to introduce by October 19, 2016. The Division
may supplement its designations and Respondents may offer counter-designations by the close of
the record of evidence.
(5) Motion to Strike as Inadmissible, in Whole or in Part, Certain Lay Opinion
Testimony. Respondents ask that lay opinion testimony, whether contained in testimonial
transcripts or live testimony, that lacks foundation, contains legal conclusions, or is based on
specialized knowledge be excluded. In light of the fact that this case is being tried to the
undersigned and not to a lay jury, it is unnecessary to specifically order in advance that such

3

evidence be excluded. If such evidence that Respondents consider inappropriate comes into the
record, Respondents may argue against its weight in their post-hearing briefs.
(7) Motion to Preclude the Admission of Any Portions of Investigative Testimony
Transcripts without the Introduction of Corresponding Portions of Audio Recordings of
the Testimony. In response, the Division notes that the investigative testimony was
memorialized by court reporters who certified the transcripts to be accurate. The Division has
also obtained and provided to Respondents audio recordings of investigative testimony taken
from six individuals, including Respondent Tilton, and does not have access to any additional
audio recordings that may exist. The motion will be denied. To the extent that investigative
testimony is admitted in evidence in Commission proceedings, it is routinely in the form of
transcripts prepared by court reporters. Similarly, hearing testimony enters the record in the
form of written transcripts.
(8) Motion to Preclude the Introduction of Division Exhibits 118-123 (Letters from
Respondents’ Counsel). The letters are from Respondents’ Counsel to the Division, sent
between August 2011 and February 2015 concerning various aspects of the Division’s
investigation, including discovery and background information on Respondents’ businesses. The
Division’s response to the motion does not make clear the purpose for which the Division
proposes to introduce the letters. On the one hand, if the Division intends to use the letters to
establish uncontested facts, e.g., the dates when Respondents were organized, in an efficient
matter, admitting them would be unobjectionable and their weight would be unquestioned.
However, to the extent that the letters are used for impeachment or to establish contested facts,
they should be authenticated, and arguments about their weight are best made in post-hearing
briefs.
(9) Motion to Preclude the Division from Introducing into Evidence Exhibits or
Portions of Exhibits Containing Unreliable Hearsay, Including (but not Limited to)
Exhibits 129, 140, 142, 174, 184, and 190. The motion, in part relies on the FRE, which are
inapplicable. Additionally, several of the objected-to proposed exhibits are email chains that
include Respondents; and emails in the chains from others must be included for completeness
(not for the truth of what the others said). That being said, any exhibit offered by the Division
must be authenticated (unless Respondents agree to the exhibit’s authenticity, for example, as a
business record).
IT IS SO ORDERED.
