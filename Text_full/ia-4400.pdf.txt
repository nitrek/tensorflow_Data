In the Matter of
EDGAR R. PAGE
and
PAGEONE FINANCIAL INC.

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDING
Respondents, a registered investment adviser and its principal, failed to disclose a
conflict of interest. After the Commission instituted proceedings, Respondents submitted
an offer of settlement, accepted by the Commission, pursuant to which they consented to
entry of an Order Making Findings, Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-andDesist Order, and Ordering Continuation of Proceedings to determine what, if any,
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and/or other remedial action is in the
public interest. Held, it is in the public interest to bar the principal under the Investment
Advisers Act and to prohibit him under the Investment Company Act from certain
associations with the securities industry, with a right to reapply after five years for
permission to associate; revoke the adviser’s registration; and order disgorgement of
$2,751,345, plus prejudgment interest, jointly and severally.
APPEARANCES:
Robert Heim, Meyers & Heim LLP, for Edgar R. Page and PageOne Financial, Inc.
Alexander Janghorbani, Gerald Gross, and Eric Schmidt, for the Division of
Enforcement.

Initial decision filed: June 25, 2015
Respondents’ petition for review filed: July 15, 2015
Division of Enforcement’s cross-petition for review filed: July 24, 2015
Last brief received: November 14, 2015
Respondents PageOne Financial, Inc. (“PageOne”), a registered investment adviser, and
Edgar Page (“Page”), its owner and founder, appeal from an administrative law judge’s
(“ALJ’s”) Initial Decision ordering that they jointly and severally disgorge $2,184,859.30, plus
prejudgment interest; that Page be subject to a five-year bar pursuant to the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”); and that PageOne’s registration be revoked.1 After we issued our
Order Instituting Proceedings (“OIP”), Respondents made an offer to settle their liability, which
we accepted. We issued an Order Making Findings, Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Ceaseand-Desist Order, and Ordering Continuation of Proceedings (“Order”),2 under which
Respondents consented to (i) the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the Order, but solely
for the purpose of this proceeding and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission or to which the Commission is a party;3 (ii) cease and desist from committing or
causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207 of the
Advisers Act; (iii) a censure; and (iv) additional proceedings to determine what, if any,
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and/or other remedial action is in the public
interest.4
In proceedings after our Order, the ALJ’s Initial Decision imposed a five-year collateral
bar against Page pursuant to the Advisers Act, revoked PageOne’s registration as an investment
adviser, and required disgorgement of $2,184,850.30, with prejudgment interest, jointly and
severally against both Page and PageOne. The ALJ declined to impose a civil penalty. Both
Page and PageOne challenge the Initial Decision’s sanctions, and also raise a constitutional
challenge to the appointment of the ALJ.
In a cross-petition for review, Division of Enforcement (“Division”) challenges the Initial
Decision’s imposition of a time-limited collateral bar on Page, as opposed to a permanent bar
with a right to reapply after five years. The Division also challenges the Initial Decision for not

imposing a bar pursuant to Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act. The Division does not
challenge the revocation of PageOne’s registration or the decision not to impose civil penalties.
We base our findings on an independent review of the record, except with respect to the
findings determined conclusively in our Order and those additional findings not challenged on
appeal.
With respect to Page, we find that the Initial Decision correctly imposed a bar pursuant to
the Advisers Act; we conclude, however, that the bar should not be time-limited and expire
automatically, but should instead be a permanent bar with a right to reapply to associate after
five years. We also conclude that Page should also be subject to an Investment Company Act
prohibition with a right to reapply to associate after five years.
With respect to PageOne, we agree with the Initial Decision’s revocation of its
registration pursuant to the Advisers Act.
We impose an order of disgorgement of $2,751,345, an amount different than calculated
by the ALJ, jointly and severally on both Page and PageOne.
Finally, we reject Respondents’ argument that appointment of Commission ALJs is
subject to the requirements of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
BACKGROUND
Our Order provided that for purposes of the “additional proceedings” on sanctions, the
Order’s findings “shall be accepted as and deemed true by the hearing officer.”5 We presume
familiarity with the Order’s findings, which are binding on us in this sanctions part of the
proceeding, and briefly summarize them and other stipulated facts here.
This matter involves a significant undisclosed conflict of interest between Respondents
and a real estate development and management company (the “Fund Manager”). The Fund
Manager established three “private investment funds, not registered with the Commission” (the
“Private Funds” or the “Funds”). We found that “[s]ometime in late 2008, [Page] agreed that the
Fund Manager would acquire PageOne. The parties agreed that [(a)] [t]he Fund Manager would
pay the acquisition price of approximately $3 million in installments over time; and [(b)] [t]he
acquisition would not close—and the Fund Manager would not make the final payments of the
purchase price—until [Page] raised about $20 million for the Private Funds.”6

See id. at *7. Quotations in the Background section are from the Order unless otherwise

noted.

We also found that, “[s]ometime before April 2010, the Fund Manager and [Page]
revised the acquisition terms to have the Fund Manager acquire 49% of PageOne for
(continued . . .)

4
In early 2009, “Respondents began recommending that their clients invest in the Private
Funds. From March 2009 through September 2011, Respondents’ clients invested
approximately between $13 and $15 million in the Private Funds.” During “roughly” this time
period, “the Fund Manager made installment payments on the acquisition of about $2.7 million,
an amount equal to about 18% of Respondents’ clients’ investments in the Private Funds.”
These “down payments” were “memorialized as promissory notes from [Page] to the Fund
Manager.”7 “The Fund Manager made . . . payments directly to [Page], or to PageOne and other
entities and persons, at [Page’s] direction.” “The size and timing of the Fund Manager’s
payments were determined, at least partially, by when PageOne clients made investments into
the Funds.” The structure of these transactions demonstrated “both (a) [Page’s] explicit
agreement to raise money for the Private Funds as part of the acquisition; and (b) the fact that the
Fund Manager had limited liquidity,” which meant that it “needed to receive investments from
PageOne clients to free up cash to make the acquisition payments.”
Respondents did not accurately disclose the acquisition agreement or the nature and
amounts of the Fund Manager’s payments to Respondents. From March 2009 to July 2009,
“Respondents remained entirely silent concerning their relationship to the Fund Manager,” even
though “[d]uring this time (a) Respondents’ clients invested over $4 million in the Private Funds;
and (b) the Fund Manager paid Respondents approximately $300,000, equivalent to
approximately 7% of the total invested.”
Respondents later made a variety of false or misleading representations about the Fund
Manager and the payments. Respondents first revised PageOne’s Form ADV Part II, effective
July 31, 2009, by making several false or misleading disclosures about relationships to
“unaffiliated private funds,” and about the receipt of “a referral fee of between 7.0% and 0.75%
of the amount invested by the client.”8 The revision also falsely stated that “[a]ll private
investment funds recommended by [PageOne] are managed by unaffiliated investment advisors.”

(continued . . .)
approximately $2.4 million, which was later increased by agreement to approximately $3
million.”
7

Page understood that in the event the acquisition was consummated, the Fund Manager
would cancel the notes. Page also understood that he was personally liable for their repayment
until the acquisition closed and the Fund Manager canceled the notes.
8

The statement calling the Funds “unaffiliated” was misleading because it suggested “no
relationship between Respondents and the Private Funds,” even though “the Fund Manager had
agreed in principle to acquire at least 49% of PageOne and had made a $300,000 down payment
on that acquisition.” The reference to a “referral fee” was false and misleading because: (i) the
“payments to Respondents were simply not fees for referring investments,” but “were down
payments on the acquisition of at least 49% of PageOne”; and (ii) while the Form ADV was
(continued . . .)

5
Respondents revised PageOne’s Form ADV effective September 14, 2010, by removing
the references to a “referral fee.” “In its place, the revised Form ADV stated that PageOne
would charge its clients a 1% annual management fee on money invested in the Private Funds.”9
The revised Form ADV falsely or misleadingly stated that the Fund Manager employed Page as
a “consultant” and compensated him for his “consulting services,” even though, “[a]s [Page]
knew, he was never a consultant to the Fund Manager, provided no consulting services, and,
thus, was never compensated for any such services.” Respondents’ final amendment to the Form
ADV, effective March 1, 2011, “delet[ed] all references to the Fund Manager and the Private
Funds.”
“Over the course of 2010 and 2011, [Page] became increasingly concerned that the
acquisition would not close. He understood that he had not been able to raise $20 million, a
condition precedent for the acquisition. And, he knew or recklessly disregarded that the Fund
Manager had not been able to otherwise raise sufficient funds to pay the balance on the
acquisition price.” We found that “Respondents’ clients made their last investments in the
Private Funds in September 2011, shortly after the Fund Manager made its last payment to
Page.” Ultimately, “[d]espite paying about $2.7 million to Respondents, the Fund Manager
never consummated its acquisition of 49% of PageOne. . . . In April 2013, the Fund Manager
wrote to Page seeking repayment of the promissory notes of $2,751,345 in principal and
$933,486.32 in interest on the grounds that the acquisition had not closed.”
After we instituted proceedings, Respondents consented to entry of the Order. We found
that, as a result of the conduct described above, Page and PageOne willfully violated Advisers
Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2), which prohibit fraudulent conduct by an investment adviser; and
Advisers Act Section 207, which makes it “unlawful for any person willfully to make any untrue
statement of a material fact in any registration application or report filed with the Commission
. . . or willfully to omit to state in any such application or report any material fact which is
required to be stated therein.” And we found that Page willfully aided and abetted and caused
PageOne’s violations of Advisers Act Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 207.

(continued . . .)
effective the Fund Manager made down payments “in excess of 15% of . . . Respondents’
clients[’] invest[ments] into the Private Funds during that time.”
9

Page later testified that he did charge clients an annual management fee of between
0.75% and 1% on assets invested in the Funds “just to continually see the [clients] and answer
the[ir] questions on [the Fund Manager].”

SANCTIONS

Bars For Page

Investment Advisers Act Bar Is Appropriate

To impose a bar on association with any investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal
securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating
organization as a remedy for Page’s violations of the Advisers Act, we must find that (i) Page
willfully violated, or aided and abetted a violation of, the Advisers Act, and (ii) the sanction is in
the public interest.10
The findings in our Order have already conclusively established several of these
elements: Page willfully violated the Advisers Act; Page aided and abetted PageOne’s
violations; and PageOne was an investment adviser (and by implication, Page was one too).11
We also found that Page was PageOne’s “sole owner and principal,”12 from which it follows here
that Page met the broad statutory definition of a “person associated with an investment adviser”
because he “directly or indirectly controll[ed]” PageOne as its “partner, officer, or director.”13
The only contested criterion is whether industry bars are in the public interest, and we
find that they are. In determining whether a bar would serve the public interest, we consider the
egregiousness of Page’s actions (including his aiding and abetting of PageOne’s fraudulent
conduct), the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, his
recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct, the sincerity of his assurances against future

10

15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(f).

11

Our Order found that Page was a primary violator of Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and
(2). Because those statutes apply only to “investment advisers,” our Order necessarily
determined that Page met the statutory definition of an adviser as one compensated to “advis[e]
others . . . as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or
selling securities.” 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11); see also, e.g., Warwick Capital Mgmt., Inc.,
Advisers Act Release No. 2694, 2008 WL 149127, at *9 n.37 (Jan. 16, 2008) (holding advisory
firm’s president liable as an “investment adviser” because “his activities cause[d] him to meet
the broad definition of investment adviser”) (quotation marks omitted).

violations, and the likelihood that his occupation will present opportunities for future
violations.14 Our inquiry is flexible, and no one factor is dispositive.15
a. Page’s fraud was egregious, and was not mitigated by his and
PageOne’s purported engagement of compliance professionals or
their unrelated disclosures.
“Investors in the securities industry place a high degree of trust and confidence in the
investment advisory relationship.”16 As an adviser, Page was a fiduciary with respect to his and
PageOne’s clients, and consequently owed “an affirmative duty of ‘utmost good faith, and full
and fair disclosure of all material facts, as well as an affirmative obligation to employ reasonable
care to avoid misleading’ clients.’”17 Advisers are required as a matter of law to disclose
“economic conflicts of interests” to their clients.18 Page betrayed his clients’ trust and breached
his fiduciary duties by failing to disclose—or to cause PageOne to disclose—the relationship
with the Fund Manager, the payments either he or PageOne was receiving, or the terms of the
acquisition. He did not tell his clients these things because, in his view, it was “too dangerous”;
“it would cause thousands of clients to get extremely nervous if I was selling my firm.” This
suggests to us that Page decided not to disclose the conflict—in breach of his fiduciary duties—
because he would be unable to recruit sufficient investors for the Funds if he made the
disclosure. We “consistently view[] misconduct involving a breach of fiduciary duty . . . as
egregious.”19
Respondents’ principal argument against a bar is that Page’s misconduct was not
egregious because he delegated his compliance responsibilities to certain professionals.20

Before the ALJ, both Page and PageOne waived the affirmative defense of reliance on
the advice of counsel but sought “to show [Page’s] intent and state of mind and good faith” by
(continued . . .)

8
Respondents introduced evidence before the ALJ that PageOne had engaged counsel, but the
briefing on appeal does not point to that counsel—or to any other counsel that was engaged
regarding the Form ADV disclosures.21 Page focuses instead upon the involvement, in preparing
those disclosures, of third-party compliance firm National Regulatory Services (“NRS”). But
NRS was not Respondents’ counsel. NRS warned PageOne in its contract, which bore Page’s
signature, that it was not rendering legal advice and was not responsible for the Form ADVs’
accuracy. Similarly, the NRS representative handling PageOne’s Form ADV told Sean Burke,
PageOne’s Assistant Compliance Manager, that he was not Page’s or PageOne’s attorney.
Assuming that engagement of compliance professionals—as compared to counsel—
might under some circumstances mitigate the egregiousness of a wrongdoer’s misconduct,
Page’s argument is not persuasive. Neither he nor PageOne made a full disclosure of the
relevant facts to the compliance professionals they engaged.22 As the ALJ recognized, in at least
one instance Respondents “did not provide NRS with adequate information.” In preparing the
Form ADV effective September 2010, Burke told NRS to disclose “that Ed [P]age will be
compensated as a consultant.” The NRS representative suggested language nearly identical to
what was included in the Form ADV, but explained that it was “the best [he] could do without
further information re: Ed’s arrangement with [the Fund Manager],” and asked for “any other
information” that should be added. Burke never provided the information known to him and
Page—that Page was not a consultant to the Fund Manager—that was required to make the
disclosure neither misleading nor false. Page’s and PageOne’s decision to engage NRS does not
mitigate the egregiousness of their misconduct, because they knew key facts that made the
disclosures NRS drafted false, and they hid those key facts from NRS.

(continued . . .)
introducing evidence that he had engaged counsel for PageOne. In a pre-hearing order, the ALJ
admitted this evidence but warned that he was disinclined to find engagement of counsel to be
mitigating without knowing what counsel told Page and PageOne—and they introduced no
evidence on that point. In the Initial Decision, the ALJ nonetheless “credit[ed], as a mitigating
fact in understanding Page’s mental state, the fact that PageOne engaged” compliance
professionals such as “NRS, and that Page relied heavily upon NRS and Burke in attempting to
fashion sufficient Form ADV disclosures.” But the ALJ said that this mitigated only Page’s and
PageOne’s scienter: although the engagement of compliance professionals suggested that Page
and PageOne did not “inten[d] to harm clients,” they were still extremely reckless.
21

Page and PageOne note that counsel for a counterparty to the transaction—an affiliate of
the Fund Manager—provided advice about the transaction. But Page and PageOne never
“engaged” their counterparty’s counsel at all—let alone to help with the Form ADV disclosures.

Cf. Hal S. Herman, Exchange Act Release No. 44953, 55 S.E.C. 395, 2001 WL 1245910,
at *4 (Oct. 18, 2001) (finding no reliance on advice of counsel where respondent could not
establish that he made full disclosure to counsel).

9
Page also points to Burke’s involvement and contends that the ALJ erred in excluding
Burke’s investigative testimony. But the ALJ did not exclude Burke’s testimony. Our Order
said that the ALJ “may determine” sanctions based on “the record as it exists on January 31,
2015, including . . . investigative testimony.”23 While Page cited Burke’s testimony in the
proposed findings of fact, neither he nor PageOne offered it for admission. There was no error in
the ALJ finding facts based only on the “transcript[s] of testimony . . . admitted into evidence”
and other evidence “accepted into the record.”24 In any event, Burke was Page’s subordinate and
was not an attorney. Because Page ignored his own supervisory compliance responsibilities after
delegating them, Burke’s role in carrying out those delegated responsibilities could not mitigate
the egregiousness of Page’s misconduct.
Page argues that the misconduct was not egregious because his and PageOne’s clients
“will not suffer harm” from their investments. Even if those consequences do not materialize,
the “absence from the record of evidence demonstrating any direct customer harm is not
mitigating, as our public interest analysis focus[es] . . . on the welfare of investors generally.”25
The record, however, establishes a likelihood that clients will suffer harm. In letters to investors,
the Fund Manager wrote that one of the Funds “lost” 91% of its assets under management in two
failed real estate ventures, and that some of the remaining assets had been invested in a nowbankrupt venture. The Fund Manager also wrote that another of the Funds “invested over $6.8
million” in the same now-bankrupt venture.26 Although the consequences to investors are
unclear, the record belies the suggestion that clients will suffer no harm.27

Rule of Practice 350(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.350(a). The Division identified Burke’s
investigative testimony in a pre-hearing exhibit list but did not seek its admission. That Page and
PageOne understood the significance and necessity of compliance with Rule of Practice 350(a)
to create the record is evident from their own motion to admit exhibits as evidence.
25

vFinance Invs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 62448, 2010 WL 2674858, at *17 (July
2, 2010) (citation omitted); see Dawson, 2010 WL 2886183, at *3 (barring respondent in part
because his “dishonesty in defrauding his clients breached the trust that is the underpinning of
the fiduciary relationship, regardless of whether there was any net loss of money to his clients”).
26

Before revealing that one of its investments was now bankrupt, the latter of these Funds
had returned to investors the dividends described in the underlying private placement
memorandum and returned ten percent of principal invested to investors.
27

Page points out that the clients were accredited and sophisticated, and that they were
apprised of risks inherent to investing in the funds. But that does not excuse Respondents’
failure to disclose the relationship with the Fund Manager or the conflict of interest, and so
neither makes their fraud less egregious.

10
Page also claims that the misconduct was not egregious because Respondents took
“affirmative steps” to disclose a separate conflict of interest. Page alleges that Respondents
disclosed that Page would receive “referral fees” through which he “stood to earn 49% of the
funds” that PageOne clients invested. This argument is refuted by our Order’s finding that the
disclosures about referral fees “materially misrepresented both the nature and amounts of the
Fund Manager’s payments,” and that Page and PageOne “knowingly or recklessly failed to tell
their clients” the other details about the Fund Manager’s acquisition of PageOne’s equity.28 A
fiduciary cannot avoid its obligation of full disclosure by disclosing a different conflict of
interest.29 And even if Respondents had disclosed a potential conflict of interest related to
referral fees, they could not have made that disclosure to clients who invested when the Form
ADV at issue was not in effect—either before July 2009 or after September 2010. The
egregiousness of the misconduct here is not mitigated by other disclosures either Page or
PageOne claim to have made.
b. The remaining Steadman factors support a bar.
Page acted with scienter in violating Advisers Act Section 206(1). The parties dispute
whether Respondents’ misconduct was intentional or reckless. The ALJ found that Respondents
acted recklessly, and that they would not have engaged NRS had they intended to defraud their
clients. The argument is ultimately irrelevant.30 We have found an industry bar to be in the
public interest where, among other factors, the respondent’s “degree of scienter” is “at least
reckless.”31 And here, our Order found that Page violated Section 206(1), for which scienter is a
28

Order at *2. The factual premise that Respondents took steps to disclose the conflict is
also faulty. The Form ADV dated July 2009 said that clients could be charged a 7% referral fee,
and the private placement memoranda said that the investments could have been locked up for 7
years or more. But Page knew that he would never earn 49% of his clients’ investments in
referral fees; he testified that he considered charging the referral fee one time only—not
annually—and that in fact he never charged the fee. He also testified that he “never intended this
disclosure to have anything to do with the acquisition.”
29

Cf. SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 191-92 (1963) (holding
that advisers must “at least . . . expose[] all conflicts of interest which might incline [an]
investment adviser—consciously or unconsciously—to render advice which was not
disinterested”).
30

We found that Page “told [Burke] that he did not want to disclose the true nature of the
agreement with the Fund Manager.” Combined with Burke’s failure to disclose all the facts to
NRS, Page’s approach to disclosure indicates to us that Page was trying to conceal his and
PageOne’s conduct from NRS. That suggests they acted intentionally.

11
necessary element that can be demonstrated, at minimum, by extreme recklessness.32 He also
aided and abetted PageOne’s violations.33
Page’s violations were also recurrent. He asserts that the misconduct was “isolated”
because he and PageOne “ceased recommending” the Funds “long before this proceeding was
brought,” the “only remaining financial relationship” with the Fund Manager is the outstanding
promissory notes, and neither Page nor PageOne had previously “worked on a private offering.”
Between 2008 and 2011, however, both Page and PageOne repeatedly recommended that their
clients invest in the Funds without disclosing that the Fund Manager had negotiated to purchase
an equity stake in PageOne, or that Page had significant personal incentives to ensure that clients
invested $20 million in the Funds. Page approved four Form ADVs filed with the Commission
that did not accurately disclose the conflict of interest. His fraud, and the fraud and violations
that he that aided and abetted, were neither one-time nor isolated occurrences.
The ALJ found that Page had made “a sincere, recent, and clear recognition of
responsibility.” Page settled the issue of liability with the Commission, and later testified that he
“accept[ed] full responsibility . . . for not having had a greater hand” in disclosing the conflicts.
We accept the ALJ’s finding concerning Page’s sincerity in accepting responsibility, but aspects
of the record raise troubling questions about the violations for which he believes he is
responsible. He maintains, for example, that the “basis of Respondents’ liability” was their
“negligent or reckless reliance upon Mr. Burke and NRS.” However, we found that Page
“knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose accurately the acquisition agreement as well as the

true nature and amounts of the Fund Manager’s payments to Respondents,”34 so Page’s
characterization of his violation is inaccurate.35
Page’s position on appeal cast doubts upon whether he “fully understand[s] the
seriousness of his misconduct and how it violated the duties of a securities professional.”36 The
suggestions that others were responsible for the fraud, and that clients were notified of the
conflict of interest, come close to challenging the underlying basis for Page’s violations.
“Denying that there is a factual basis for . . . securities law violations in the [OIP] (something
[Page] agreed not to do) does not amount to a meaningful recognition of [his] misconduct.”37
Page has offered some assurances against “repeat[ing] [his] mistakes in the future,”
which the ALJ found “sincere and credible.” But “accepting the sincerity of [Page’s] assurances
against future misconduct does not mean that ‘there can be no risk of future misconduct
warranting a bar’”; we weigh such assurances “against the other Steadman factors in assessing
the public interest.”38 Moreover, even assuming that the assurances were sincerely made at the
time he made them, we have reason to be skeptical of his ability to carry them out at some point
in the future.
For instance, Page claims he did not have “any regulatory issues” during his career.39 In
fact, Page was disciplined by a state securities regulator in 1989 for transacting business in
general securities without a Series 7 license and for selling unregistered securities.
Notwithstanding the sincerity of Page’s present assurances that he will not commit such
misconduct again, “the risk that he would not be able to fulfill his commitment is sufficiently

Page also suggests that he and PageOne took “affirmative steps to put their clients on
notice” of the conflict of interest by disclosing a nonexistent conflict related to referral fees. As
we noted above, this contention has no merit.

great that permanent associational bars are required to protect the public interest.”40 Page’s
failure to learn from his experience the importance of complying with the securities laws—
coupled with the misrepresentation of his disciplinary history—casts doubt on whether he can
resist future opportunities for misconduct.
Page’s long career in the securities industry and continuing operation of PageOne suggest
that Page would, if permitted, continue to associate with the securities industry. Page has
suggested as much: in lieu of an industry bar, “Page has proposed . . . a bar from participating in
private placements and acting as a compliance officer, in addition to a cease and desist order.”41
If Page continued to operate in the securities industry as he clearly intends, he would be
presented with further opportunities to engage in misconduct.42
For these reasons, we find that it is in the public interest to bar Page permanently from
the industry associations identified in Advisers Act Section 203(f). We address in section A.3
below whether to grant Page the right to reapply for these associations after a certain time.
2.

Investment Company Act Bar Is Appropriate

In its cross-petition for review, the Division argues that, having found that the relevant
criteria were met, the Initial Decision should have barred Page from the investment company
associations provided for under Investment Company Act Section 9(b). Page does not respond
to this argument.
Investment Company Act Section 9(b) allows us to prohibit a person “from serving or
acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or
depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of
such investment adviser, depositor, or principal underwriter,” if we find that the person has
willfully violated or aided and abetted a violation of the Advisers Act, and that an such a
prohibition is in the public interest.43 It is undisputed that Page violated the Advisers Act, and
aided and abetted violations of the Advisers Act.

Kornman, 2009 WL 367635, at *11; see also Jeffrey R. Gibson, Exchange Act Release
No. 57266, 2008 WL 294717, at *6 (Feb. 4, 2008) (“[W]e have accepted Gibson’s assertions, but
nevertheless have determined that they do not outweigh the other Steadman factors that weigh in
favor of barring Gibson from continuing in the industry.”).
41

Given the nature of the misconduct and the opportunity that continued participation in the
industry would present for future violations, a sanction limited to voluntary bars against working
on private placements and serving as a compliance officer would provide inadequate deterrence
and would therefore insufficiently protect the public. See Siris, 2013 WL 6528874, at *6 n.43.

We find that it is in the public interest to permanently prohibit Page from serving in the
capacities identified in Investment Company Act Section 9(b), for the same reasons we explained
above. Neither party addresses the appropriate length of time for a prohibition under Section
9(b), which may be “permanent[] or for such period of time” is “appropriate in the public
interest.”44 We impose a permanent prohibition under Section 9(b), subject to the same right to
reapply that we discuss in section A.3 below.
3.

Permanent Bars With A Right To Reapply After Five Years

Having found that a bar under the Advisers Act and a prohibition under the Investment
Company Act are in the public interest, we must decide whether to grant Page the right to
reapply.45 The Division contends that “a right to reapply after five years is appropriate in this
44

Id.

45

The Initial Decision imposed a “five-year associational bar” prohibiting Page from the
associations identified in Advisers Act Section 203(f). Initial Decision at 10. This departs from
our usual practice. Typically, a so-called “time-limited” bar takes the form of a bar with a right
to reapply for consent to associate after a certain period of time. See, e.g., Eric J. Brown,
Securities Act Release No. 9299, 2012 WL 625874, at *13 (Feb. 27, 2012) (barring respondent
from associating with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser, with a right to reapply in nonsupervisory capacity after two years), petition denied sub nom., Collins v. SEC, 736 F.3d 521
(D.C. Cir. 2013); Robert Rodano, Advisers Act Release No. 2750, 2008 WL 2574440, at *8
(June 30, 2008) (barring respondent from associating with an investment adviser, but providing
for a right to reapply after five years).
There is a significant distinction between a true time-limited bar and a bar that includes a
right to reapply after a certain period of time. A bar with a right to reapply provides additional
investor protection because it requires barred persons to apply for consent to associate prior to
re-entering the industry. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(f). Our Rule of Practice 193, for example,
specifies the procedures to be followed by barred individuals who reapply for association when
our order provides for a right to reapply. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.193(a). The Rule specifies the
standards against which we assess these applications, including the extent to which “proposed
supervision, procedures, or terms and conditions” may “prevent a recurrence” of misconduct.
See id. § 201.193 prelim. note & .193(d). Our “long-standing approach” in applying these
standards “reflects the Commission’s statutory obligation to ensure that a request for relief or
modification comports with the public interest and investor protection.” Stephen S. Wien,
Exchange Act Release No. 49000, 2003 WL 23094748, at *4 (Dec. 29, 2003). For barred
individuals who seek consent to associate with a member of a self-regulatory organization, we
follow a similar process in reviewing such applications under Exchange Act Rule 19h-1. See 17
C.F.R. § 240.19h-1.
Page and PageOne respond by pointing out that Advisers Act Section 203(f) does not
authorize our practice of providing for a right to reapply. That is mistaken: the statute provides

case,” and Respondents counter that an Advisers Act bar, if imposed, should last for five years
and expire automatically. We believe that Page should be granted the right to reapply, and that
his Advisers Act bar should not expire automatically. Page’s misconduct was egregious, as we
discussed above, and while it may be permissible for Page to associate with the industry at some
point in the future, it is in the public interest that the Commission retain the control over the
conditions of association contemplated by our Rule of Practice 193.
Neither party addresses the appropriate length of time for a prohibition under Investment
Company Act Section 9(b). If after five years Page can satisfy his burden under Rule 193 of
showing that it is in the public interest to permit him to associate under the Advisers Act, it is
conceivable that he could do the same under the Investment Company Act, too.
Because we determine that the public interest requires it, we impose a permanent bar
under the Advisers Act and permanent prohibition under the Investment Company Act, with a
right to reapply after five years.
B.

Revocation of PageOne’s Registration

In determining whether to revoke an investment adviser’s registration, we apply the same
public interest factors discussed above in connection with Page’s industry bar.46 In choosing a
remedy we need not “follow any mechanistic formula,” and our choice is due deference as

(continued . . .)
that it is “unlawful” for a suspended or barred individual to become “associated with an
investment adviser without the consent of the Commission.” 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(f). Because the
statute is silent about when we may grant or deny consent, we have interpreted it to allow time
limitations before which a barred individual may not reapply for association. Applications by
Barred Individuals for Consent to Associate with a Registered Broker, Dealer, Municipal
Securities Dealer, Investment Adviser or Investment Company, Exchange Act Release No.
20783, 1984 WL 547096 (Mar. 16, 1984). Our bar orders may therefore provide for a right to
reapply after a certain time.
Because we decide that the appropriate sanction is a permanent bar with a right to reapply
after five years, we need not address the Division’s argument in its cross-petition for review that
the Initial Decision could not have imposed a five-year bar. See Eric J. Brown, Securities Act
Release No. 3393, 2012 WL 1143573, at *2 (Apr. 5, 2012) (order denying reconsideration)

files a petition for review”).

“peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.”47 We conclude that the public interest
factors supporting an industry bar for Page also support revocation of PageOne’s registration.48
PageOne argues revoking its registration would violate the D.C. Circuit’s rule that a
sanction is arbitrary and capricious if out of line with administrative precedent.49 PageOne does
not contend that we have never revoked an adviser’s registration in a comparable case; instead, it
cites to four cases in which we did not do so. Three involved settlements of liability and
sanctions,50 but settlements are not precedent.51 What is more, the “pragmatic considerations”
that make it “inappropriate” to compare the sanctions in litigated and in settled cases—such as
the cost savings that justify agreeing to “lesser sanctions” in settlements52—apply here because,
although PageOne settled on liability, it litigated the question of the appropriate sanctions.
PageOne also concedes that the settlements it cites were for “non-scienter” violations; its
violations of Advisers Act Section 206(1) involved scienter, which weighs in favor of an order
revoking PageOne’s registration. The fourth case PageOne cites, IMS/CPAs,53 was fully
litigated. That case is not comparable, however, because here the fraud was more financially
significant to the wrongdoers, netting $2.7 million as opposed to $75,000 in IMS/CPAs.
Ultimately, the determination of the appropriate sanction depends on the particular facts and

47

Kornman, 592 F.3d at 186.

48

We find for reasons similar to those relevant to Page, as described above, that: (i)
PageOne’s misconduct was egregious because it involved a breach of PageOne’s fiduciary duty
to its clients; (ii) PageOne acted with extreme recklessness; (iii) its violations were recurrent; (iv)
its conduct in these proceedings, through its owner and principal, calls into question the extent to
which its settlement reflects recognition of the wrongful nature of its misconduct; (v) it is
doubtful that PageOne, through Page, could satisfy its assurances—assumed to be sincere—
against future misconduct.

circumstances of each case and is not dependent on the sanctions imposed in other cases, even if
those other cases present some similar facts.54
PageOne also points to a statement by Commission staff observing that, as PageOne
paraphrases it, “inadequate disclosures of conflicts of interest are a very common issue among
many investment advisors.”55 It is no defense that others in the industry are also acting
improperly.56 Revoking PageOne’s registration will offer investors protection from future harm
by providing a deterrent against other advisers violating their disclosure obligations.
PageOne next contends that revoking its registration would be inconsistent with our
nonbinding Statement Concerning Financial Penalties,57 in which we said that imposing
monetary civil penalties upon corporations may unfairly harm innocent shareholders who had no
role in misconduct. Here PageOne’s sole owner was at the center of its violations. PageOne also
focuses on the negative effect that revoking its registration would have on its innocent
employees, its broker-dealer affiliates, and those clients who have remained with PageOne.
These considerations cannot control, however, because the overriding concern in ordering
sanctions is to protect the broader public. In an analogous context, Congress recognized that
revoking a broker-dealer’s registration could have “adverse consequences” on the “firm’s
customers, public shareholders, and innocent employees,” so it authorized us to impose civil
money penalties as an intermediate sanction.58 That a firm’s registration may nonetheless be
revoked suggests that, under appropriate circumstances, the public interest factors can outweigh
the effect revocation may have upon innocent third parties. We find that is the case here.
PageOne presents a significant risk of future misconduct, and that risk extends to its clients and
counterparties. It is in the public interest to revoke PageOne’s registration.

Disgorgement Of Respondents’ Ill-Gotten Gains Is Appropriate

Advisers Act Section 203(k) authorizes disgorgement, including reasonable interest, in a
cease-and-desist proceeding.59 “Disgorgement is an equitable remedy designed to deprive
wrongdoers of their unjust enrichment and to deter others from similar misconduct.”60 “[T]he
amount of disgorgement should include all gains flowing from the illegal activities, but
calculating disgorgement ‘requires only a reasonable approximation of [ill-gotten] profits
causally connected to the violation.’”61
We find that disgorgement of the full amount paid by the Fund Manager to Respondents,
along with prejudgment interest, is in the public interest.
1.

Scienter Not Required For Disgorgement

Respondents contend that disgorgement is improper absent “a high degree of scienter.”
Respondents offer no authority for their argument, beyond simply citing cases involving a high
degree of scienter in which we ordered disgorgement.62 Respondents are incorrect:
disgorgement is routinely ordered even in connection with non-scienter violations.63

Respondents’ Unjust Enrichment

62

In one of the cases that Respondents cite, the Court ordered disgorgement from relief
defendants who had not been charged with any violation of the law, much less one that involved
a high degree of scienter. See SEC v Martino, 255 F. Supp. 2d 268, 288 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)
(recognizing that the “equitable powers [of disgorgement] extend[] to a person who, although not
accused of wrongdoing, received ill-gotten gains and ‘does not have a legitimate claim to those
funds’”).
63

See, e.g., SEC v. Merchant Capital LLC, 397 F. App’x 593, 595 (11th Cir. 2010)

on scienter, but is tied instead to the idea of unjust enrichment: the broad idea is that persons not
profit from breaking the securities laws”).

19
unjust.”64 Requiring Respondents to disgorge the payments they received would further the
equitable and deterrent purposes of disgorgement by making those violations unprofitable.65
As our Order found, Respondents received $2,751,345 from the Fund Manager. The
Division sought disgorgement of that full amount, along with prejudgment interest. The Initial
Decision reduced the principal disgorgement figure to $2,184,859.30, primarily because
PageOne’s Form ADV stated for a time that it would receive a referral fee of up to 7% for
investments in the Funds by PageOne clients.66 The Initial Decision reasoned that this statement,
although untrue, for a period of time provided notice to investors that Respondents could receive
7% of the amount invested by PageOne clients. The reduction of disgorgement also accounted
for PageOne’s disclosure for a time in its Form ADV that PageOne would receive a 1%
management fee, which the Initial Decision reasoned provided notice to investors that
Respondents could receive 1% of the amount invested by PageOne clients.67
In reducing the amount of disgorgement, the Initial Decision reasoned that “disgorgement
is an equitable form of relief.” But the public interest in full disclosure of all material conflicts
of interest would be served poorly by providing an offset for disclosing irrelevant or nonexistent
conflicts of interest. Even though Respondents disclosed a management fee and a nonexistent
7% referral fee, neither of these reflected the undisclosed down payments that Respondents
received as part of the undisclosed deal with the Fund Manager. It would be inequitable to allow
industry professionals to keep illicit profits from significant conflicts if they concoct and disclose
less significant conflicts. We conclude that neither offset is appropriate here, and that the
Divisions’ proposed disgorgement figure, $2,751,345, is the more reasonable approximation of
Respondents’ ill-gotten gains.68

See, e.g., Schoemann, 2009 WL 3413043, at *13 (“The effective enforcement of the
federal securities laws requires that the SEC be able to make violations unprofitable. The
deterrent effect of an SEC enforcement action would be greatly undermined if securities law
violators were not required to disgorge illicit profits.”) (quoting SEC v. Manor Nursing Ctrs.,
Inc., 485 F.2d 1082, 1104 (2d Cir. 1972)).
66

While the “referral fee” disclosure was effective between July 31, 2009, and September
13, 2010, PageOne clients made $7,999,400 in investments. The Initial Decision discounted the
proposed disgorgement by $559,958, or 7% of that amount.
67

While the “management fee” disclosure was effective between September 14, 2010, and
March 1, 2011, PageOne clients made $652,770 in investments. The Initial Decision discounted
the proposed disgorgement by $6,527.70, or 1% of that amount.
68

Page and PageOne ask for two other offsets, but we reject both. First, they request that
the amount of their disgorgement be offset to reflect business expenses. We apply the rule that
(continued . . .)

20
Respondents argue that they have not been unjustly enriched because Page remains liable
to repay the promissory notes. “Once the Division has shown that its disgorgement figure
reasonably approximates the amount of unjust enrichment, the burden shifts to the respondent,
who is ‘then obliged clearly to demonstrate that the disgorgement figure was not a reasonable
approximation.’”69 Respondents filed on March 14, 2016, a “Notice of Supplemental
Developments” consisting of state court pleadings, including a summons and complaint, filed by
the Fund Manager in actions against Page in December 2015 and January 2016.70 These
documents do not satisfy Page’s burden of demonstrating that the disgorgement figure was not a
reasonable approximation of the amount of unjust enrichment.

(continued . . .)
“how a defendant chooses to spend his ill-gotten gains, whether it be for business expenses,
personal use, or otherwise is immaterial to disgorgement.” SEC v. Aerokinetic Energy Corp.,
444 F. App’x 382, 385 (11th Cir. 2011) (alteration omitted); see Laurie Jones Canady, Exchange
Act Release No. 41250, 1999 WL 183600, at *10 n.35 (Apr. 5, 1999) (collecting authority).
Page and PageOne have not even identified the expenses that they say should be offset; they
have therefore not met their burden of showing that the calculation of disgorgement was an
“[un]reasonable approximation of [their] ill-gotten gains.” Ralph Calabro, Securities Act
Release No. 9798, 2015 WL 3439152, at *45 n.233 (May 29, 2015) (noting that even if we
assumed an offset for expenses were available, Respondents had not established that they were
entitled to one).
Second, Page and PageOne ask us to reduce the amount of their disgorgement to allow
them to keep the management fees they say they would have earned had their clients not invested
in the Funds. Page testified that those clients who invested in the Funds were still charged a
management fee of between 0.75% and 1% on those investments. See supra note 9. There is no
authority that would allow them to retain the opportunity cost of their fraud. Allowing this offset
would be inconsistent with a core purpose of disgorgement—making violations of the securities
laws unprofitable.

Respondents have not asked for leave to adduce this as additional evidence under our
Rule of Practice 452. 17 C.F.R. § 201.452. But we take official notice under our Rule of
Practice 323, 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, of the existence of the state court cases, and of the pleadings
attached to Respondents’ filing.

21
No judgment has been entered in the state court litigation. None of the documents the
parties have submitted establishes that Page is in fact liable on the notes.71 These documents
simply reiterate that the litigation is ongoing.
Respondents have neither admitted liability to, nor contended that they have already paid,
the Fund Manager.72 In fact, Page is contesting the litigation, arguing he is not liable on the
notes because the Fund Manager’s principal had “reassure[ed] [him] that at no time will the
[Fund Manager] ever seek to enforce the Notes,” and the parties had purportedly memorialized
that intent.73 Respondents also argued in their Wells submission, introduced into the record here,
that nearly $650,000 had been designated as non-refundable in the event the deal did not close,
and that Page is “entitled to keep” the rest as compensatory damages because he “continued to
suffer” after negotiations collapsed. We agree with the Division’s observation that Respondents
are clearly “trying to have their cake and eat it too—refusing to repay the demand, while using
the demand as a shield against disgorgement.”74 Were we to suspend any disgorgement in light

The Division responded to Respondents’ Notice by filing a document, styled as an
“Opposition,” attaching an affidavit that Page filed in one of the state court cases. Although the
Division did not ask for leave to adduce this additional evidence, as with Respondents’ filing we
take official notice under Rule of Practice 323 of the affidavit attached to the Division’s filing.
74

Relying on FTC v. Loanpointe, LLC, 525 F. App’x 696 (10th Cir. 2013), Respondents
argue that the loans received cannot be “gains.” The court in Loanpointe affirmed an order
requiring disgorgement of interest that a payday lender had unlawfully collected from its clients.
Id. at 702 n.5. Respondents argue that their gains are like the principal that did not have to be
disgorged in Loanpointe. But those principal repayments were not ill-gotten gains, while the
down payments at issue here were.

22
of the litigation, as Page suggests, and if he were to prevail in the litigation, he would be able to
keep the ill-gotten gains from his misconduct.
Ultimately, this inchoate litigation, whatever its outcome, does not affect our authority to
order disgorgement. Any alleged promissory note obligation was incurred in connection with
Respondents’ fraudulent conduct: “[t]he [undisclosed] acquisition payments were memorialized
as promissory notes.”75 Any money that a court orders Respondents to pay as a result of the
promissory notes, which they failed to disclose in violation of the securities laws, would not
reduce the disgorgement in this case.76
As a result of their misconduct, Respondents had and continue to have the full benefit of
their ill-gotten gains. Because Respondents have been unjustly enriched and the required causal
nexus exists, they must disgorge the down payments—including the amounts they contend are
non-refundable, and any amounts for which repayment to the Fund Manager is disputed—plus
prejudgment interest.77

75

Page would not have received these acquisition payments at all—whether or not
structured as loans—absent his fraudulent conduct. Our Order found that Page was aware that
the Fund Manager had “limited liquidity” and “needed to receive investments from PageOne
clients to free up cash to make the acquisition payments.” Page knew the Fund Manager was
selling personal and investment assets to keep his business solvent. Page also knew that
PageOne clients’ investments were returned to him as acquisition payments: for example, Page
received an email in which the Fund Manager’s Chief Financial Officer explained that
“$212,000, $50,000 and $40,000” had recently been collected from investors, and that Page
could be “loan[ed]” the balance after subtracting commissions. Respondents stipulated that
those amounts matched the amounts of three PageOne clients’ investments in the Funds over the
two weeks preceding the email. Our Order also found that Page considered it “too dangerous” to
disclose the conflict to his clients. Taken together, the record reflects that Page convinced
PageOne clients to invest in the Funds without disclosing the conflict of interest to them, and that
the Fund Manager likely would not have made all the acquisition payments had Page and
PageOne disclosed the conflicts. The payments Page received from the Fund Manager are thus
causally connected to his violations.
76

See SEC v. Benson, 657 F. Supp. 1122, 1134 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (denying request to reduce
disgorgment, noting that “even if these had been legitimate corporate payments, the practice was
still in violation of the Federal securities laws since none of these supplements were disclosed in
the company's financial records or filings with the SEC”).
77

Respondents contend that they should not have to disgorge the loans because Page could
have “[sold] his business for a fair price.” Regardless of whether the sale price had been fairly
valued, the amount by which that price exceeded Page’s cost basis in PageOne equity still would
have been wrongfully obtained profits that we would have required Respondents to disgorge.

23
3.

Joint And Several Liability Is Appropriate

PageOne argues it should not be jointly and severally liable for disgorgement. But “jointand-several liability is appropriate in securities cases when two or more individuals or entities
collaborate or have a close relationship in engaging in the illegal conduct.”78 Each sufficient
condition exists here.
Page aided and abetted PageOne’s violations and their misconduct was inextricably
entwined.79 Once close collaboration is established, the burden shifts to the PageOne “to
establish that apportionment” rather than joint-and-several liability “is warranted.”80 PageOne
has made no effort to carry that burden. The prima facie case of close collaboration justifies
joint and several liability.
Page and PageOne also had a close relationship sufficient to justify joint and several
liability. Page was PageOne’s CEO, Chief Compliance Officer, and sole owner.81 Page was also
the means through which PageOne committed the fraud. He recommended to PageOne clients
that they invest in the Funds; he instructed Burke not to disclose the deal with the Fund Manager;
and he approved the materially false and misleading Forms ADV. He also directed that the Fund
Manager make payments directly to PageOne. PageOne’s contention that it “never received
any” payments from the Fund Manager is contradicted by Respondents’ binding pre-hearing

stipulations of fact, which demonstrate that the Fund Manager and one of the Funds paid
$939,010 directly to PageOne.82
PageOne contends that it and Page are not alter egos, citing a case applying New York’s
standard for piercing the corporate veil.83 We have specifically held that “[e]ven assuming” that
the parties are not “alter ego[s],” their collaboration and close collaboration may each be
sufficient to make them jointly and severally liable.84
PageOne argues that making PageOne jointly and severally liable would be “unduly
punitive” because PageOne purportedly received no money from the Fund Manager. Although
PageOne need not have received any of the proceeds in order to be jointly and severally liable,85
our Order found that “the Fund Manager made . . . payments . . . to PageOne . . . at [Page]’s
direction.” PageOne also stipulated before the hearing that it received $939,010 directly from
the Fund Manager.

Respondents’ Alleged Inability To Pay

Respondents contend that they should not be ordered to pay disgorgement because they
lack the ability to pay. Under Rule of Practice 630(a), we may, in our discretion, consider
evidence of ability to pay in determining whether a respondent should be required to pay
disgorgement, interest, or civil penalties.86 “Ability to pay, however, is only one factor that
informs our determination and is not dispositive.”87 “The burden of proving financial inability to
pay disgorgement falls upon the respondent[s].”88

82

See Christian Legal Soc. v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, 677-78 (2010) (holding that “factual
stipulations are formal concessions . . . that have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue”)

The ALJ permitted Respondents to submit financial statements, and certain portions of
briefing referring to those financial statements, under a protective order.89 The ALJ’s Initial
Decision, however, referred to certain information derived from those financial statements. Here
we address that information, which serves as the evidentiary basis for Respondents’ inability-topay defense, without exceeding the scope of information that the ALJ already made public in his
Initial Decision.90
We have reviewed Respondents’ financial statements. There are omissions and internal
inconsistencies in the statements. Respondents did not submit their tax returns for any year
before 2014 back to the date of the first violation.91 In addition, Page’s Statement of Financial
Condition reports a value for Page’s real estate 47% lower than the value Page reported on a
personal financial statement he submitted to a bank only seven months earlier.
There are also indications that Page may have trouble paying disgorgement because his
stated liabilities exceed his assets. But those indications appear due, in part, to Page’s spending
on luxury items and other expenses.92 Although Page’s largest liability is a debt to PageOne, the

In 2010 and 2011, Page bought a Porsche, loaned money to a daughter to fix up a house,
gifted large amounts of money, and made another large loan to a daughter “to purchase [a]
plane.” Page only responds by quibbling about whether he bought “any extravagant items
outright,” and saying that this focus on his profligate spending “fails to consider” that he was
also “paying off substantial amounts of old taxes” and other obligations that he owed.

26
latter is jointly liable for the disgorgement. Page says that he has taken “substantial steps . . . to
reduce his living expenses,” yet there is little evidence of that in the record.93
“Even when a respondent demonstrates an inability to pay, we have discretion not to
waive . . . disgorgement, . . . particularly when the misconduct is sufficiently egregious.”94
Page’s and PageOne’s misconduct, as discussed above, is egregious and caused significant
investor harm. That egregiousness is compounded by Page’s and PageOne’s failure to take
complete responsibility for the misconduct, and by the skepticism we expressed above about
Respondents’ ability to carry out their assurances that the misconduct would not be repeated.95
To the extent that it is appropriate to credit Page’s and PageOne’s alleged inability to pay, the
law judge declined to impose civil penalties, as we discuss below. However, with respect to the
disgorgement, the scope and nature of the misconduct leads us to conclude in our discretion that
waiver is not appropriate.
D.

Civil Penalties Not Requested

The ALJ declined to impose a civil penalty, in light of Page’s and PageOne’s alleged
inability to pay. The Division’s cross-petition did not seek review of that aspect of the decision,
and made no argument for why we should impose a civil penalty. For these reasons, and in our
discretion, we therefore do not impose a civil penalty.96
APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSION ALJS NOT SUBJECT TO APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE
Respondents argue that the Initial Decision should be vacated and the administrative
proceeding should be dismissed because ALJ Jason Patil—who presided over the remedies
proceeding and issued the Initial Decision—was not appointed in a manner consistent with the
Appointments Clause of the Constitution.97 We find that the appointment of Commission ALJs
is not subject to the requirements of the Appointments Clause.
93

Page has reported monthly expenses that significantly exceed his already quite high
monthly income. He offers no details about his high monthly “household expenses”—a category
that does not include his other high expenses for mortgage, food, utilities, automobiles and
household maintenance, all of which are listed separately.

We note that Respondents consented to the Commission’s Order making findings as to
liability, which preceded the ALJ’s remedies proceeding, and Respondents “agree[d] that they
may not challenge the validity of th[at] Order.”

27
Under the Appointments Clause, certain high-level government officials must be
appointed in particular ways: “Principal officers” must be appointed by the President (and
confirmed by the Senate), while “inferior officers” must be appointed either by the President, the
heads of departments, or the courts of law.98 The great majority of government personnel are
neither principal nor inferior officers, but rather “mere employees” whose appointments are not
restricted by the Appointments Clause.99 It is undisputed that ALJ Patil was not appointed by
the President, the head of a department, or a court of law.100 Respondents therefore contend that
his appointment violates the Appointments Clause because, in their view, ALJ Patil should be
deemed an inferior officer. The Division counters that he is an employee and thus there was no
violation of the Appointments Clause.
As we have previously explained,101 the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Landry v. FDIC
guides our resolution of this question.102 Landry held that, for purposes of the Appointments
Clause, ALJs at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), who oversee
administrative proceedings to remove bank executives, are employees rather than inferior
officers. Landry explained that the touchstone for determining whether adjudicators are inferior
officers is the extent to which they have the power to issue “final decisions.”103 Although ALJs
at the FDIC take testimony, conduct trial-like hearings, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and
have the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders, they “can never render the decision
of the FDIC.”104 Instead, they issue only “recommended decisions” which the FDIC Board of
98

The Clause provides that the President “by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
shall appoint . . . officers of the United States . . . but the Congress may by law vest the
appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of
law, or in the heads of departments.” U.S. Const. art. II, §2, cl. 2.

Directors reviews de novo, and “[f]inal decisions are issued only by the FDIC Board.”105 The
FDIC ALJs thus function as aides who assist the Board in its duties, not officers who exercise
significant authority independent of the Board’s supervision. Because ALJs at the FDIC “have
no such powers” of “final decision,” the D.C. Circuit “conclude[d] that they are not inferior
officers.”106
The mix of duties and powers of the Commission’s ALJs are very similar to those of the
ALJs at the FDIC. Like the FDIC’s ALJs, the Commission’s ALJs conduct hearings, take
testimony, rule on admissibility of evidence, and issue subpoenas. And like the FDIC’s ALJs,
the Commission’s ALJs do not issue the final decisions that result from such proceedings. Just
as the FDIC’s ALJs issue only “recommended decisions” that are not final, the Commission’s
ALJs issue “initial decisions” that are likewise not final.107 Respondents may petition the
Commission for review of an ALJ’s initial decision,108 and it is our “longstanding practice [to]
grant[] virtually all petitions for review.”109 Indeed, we are unaware of any case in which the
Commission has not granted a petition for review. Absent a petition, we may also choose to
review a decision on our own initiative.110 In either case, our rules expressly provide that “the
initial decision [of an ALJ] shall not become final.”111 Even where an aggrieved person fails to
file a timely petition for review of an initial decision and we do not order review on our own
initiative, our rules provide that “the Commission will issue an order that the decision has

oppositions pointless, “given that the Commission has long had a policy of granting petitions for
review, believing that there is a benefit to Commission review when a party takes exception to a
decision.” Exchange Act Release No. 48832, 2003 WL 22827684, at *13 (Nov. 23, 2003).

become final,” and it becomes final only “upon issuance of the order” by the Commission.112
Moreover, as does the FDIC, the Commission reviews our ALJs’ decisions de novo.113 Upon
review, we “may affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole
or in part,” any initial decision.114 And “any procedural errors” made by an ALJ in conducting
the hearing “are cured” by our “thorough, de novo review of the record.”115 We may expand the
record by “hear[ing] additional evidence” ourselves or remanding for further proceedings before
the ALJ, and may “make any findings or conclusions that in [our] judgment are proper and on
the basis of the record.”116

113

We do not view the fact that we accord Commission ALJs deference in the context of
demeanor-based credibility determinations to afford our ALJs with the type of authority that
would qualify them as inferior officers. First, as we have repeatedly made clear, we do not
accept such findings “blindly,” and we will “disregard explicit determinations of credibility”
when our de novo review of the record as a whole convinces us that a witness’s testimony is
credible (or not) or that the weight of the evidence warrants a different finding as to the ultimate
facts at issue. Id. at *10; accord Francis V. Lorenzo, Exchange Act Release No. 74836, 2015
WL 1927763, at *10 n.32 (Apr. 29, 2015); Irfan Mohammed Amanat, Exchange Act Release No.

(D.C. Cir. 2005) (“The law is settled that an agency is not required to adopt the credibility
determinations of an administrative law judge.”). Second, our practice in this regard is no
different from the FDIC’s and so does not warrant a departure from Landry. Compare

ALJ is given “deference” by the FDIC) with Ramon M. Candelaria, FDIC-95-62e, 1997 WL

Respondents rely on two decisions in which district courts have found that the
Commission’s ALJs are inferior officers.117 Both of those decisions reject the D.C. Circuit’s
reasoning in Landry and rely instead on Freytag v. Commissioner,118 in which the Supreme
Court held that a “special trial judge” of the Tax Court was an inferior officer. But we agree
with Landry that ALJs are different from the special trial judge in Freytag.119 In our view, the
greater role and powers of the special trial judges relative to Commission ALJs makes Freytag’s
holding inapposite here. First, unlike the ALJs whose decisions are reviewed de novo, the
special trial judges made factual findings to which the Tax Court was required to defer, unless
clearly erroneous.120 Second, the special trial judges were authorized by statute to “render the
[final] decisions of the Tax Court” in significant, fully-litigated proceedings involving
declaratory judgments and amounts in controversy below $10,000.121 As discussed above, our
ALJs issue initial decisions that are not final unless the Commission takes some further action.
Third, the Tax Court (and by extension the court’s special tax judges) exercised “a portion of the
judicial power of the United States,” including the “authority to punish contempts by fine or
imprisonment.”122 Commission ALJs, by contrast, do not possess such authority.123 And while
Commission ALJs may issue subpoenas to compel noncompliance, they are powerless to enforce

See 17 C.F.R. § 201.180. The Commission’s rules provide ALJs with authority to punish
contemptuous conduct only in the following ways. If a person engages in contemptuous conduct
before the ALJ during any proceeding, the ALJ may “exclude that person from such hearing or
conference, or any portion thereof,” or “summarily suspend that person from representing others
in the proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the duration, or any portion, of the
proceeding.” Id. § 201.180(a). If there are deficiencies in a filing, a Commission ALJ “may
reject, in whole or in part,” the filing, such filing “shall not be part of the record,” and the ALJ
“may direct a party to cure any deficiencies.” Id. § 201.180(b). Finally, if a party fails to make a
required filing or to cure a deficiency with a filing, then a Commission ALJ may enter a default,
dismiss the case, decide the particular matter at issue against the person, or prohibit the
introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning that matter.” Id. § 201.180(c). Any
such ruling would, of course, be subject to de novo Commission review.

31
their subpoenas; the Commission itself would need to seek an order from a federal district court
to compel compliance.124 In this respect, too, our ALJs are akin to the FDIC’s ALJs that Landry
found to be “mere employees.”125
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the mix of duties and powers of our ALJs is
similar in all material respects to the duties and role of the FDIC’s ALJs in Landry.
Accordingly, we follow Landry, and we conclude that our ALJs are not “inferior officers” under
the Appointments Clause.126

Beyond Landry, we believe that our ALJs are properly deemed employees (rather than
inferior officers) because this is how Congress has chosen to classify them, and that decision is
entitled to considerable deference. See Burnap v. United States, 252 U.S. 512, 516 (1920). For
example, as we discussed above, Congress created and placed ALJ positions within the
competitive service system, just like most other federal employees. Like such other employees,
an ALJ who believes that his employing agency has engaged in a prohibited personnel practice
can seek redress either through the Office of Special Counsel or the Merit Systems Protection
Board. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204, 1212, 1214, 1215, 1221. And ALJs—like other employees—are
subject to reductions-in-force. See id. § 7521(b).

We have considered all of the parties’ contentions. We have rejected or sustained them
to the extent that they are inconsistent or in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.
