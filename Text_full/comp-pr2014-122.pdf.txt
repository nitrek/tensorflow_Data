__________________________________________________________________
COMPLAINT
Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or
“SEC”) alleges as follows:
NATURE OF THE ACTION

1.

This case involves a scheme by Defendants the City of Harvey, Illinois

(the “City of Harvey” or “Harvey”) and Joseph T. Letke (“Letke”) to misuse proceeds
raised from investors in municipal bonds issued by Harvey. From 2008 to the present,
Harvey and its Comptroller, Letke, have engaged in a scheme to divert bond proceeds for
improper purposes, including undisclosed payments to Letke. As part of the scheme,
Harvey made misrepresentations and omissions to investors about how bond proceeds
would be used and the risks associated with investments in Harvey’s municipal bonds.
2.

Defendants Harvey and Letke engaged in a fraudulent scheme, and

Harvey made materially false and misleading statements, in connection with municipal
1


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 2 of 29 PageID #:2

bond offerings by Harvey to bond investors for approximately $6 million in 2008 (“2008
Bond Offering”), for approximately $3 million in 2009 (“2009 Bond Offering”) and for
approximately $5 million in 2010 (“2010 Bond Offering”).
3.

The purported purpose of the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Bond Offerings was to

provide funding to develop and construct a Holiday Inn Hotel in Harvey (“Hotel
Redevelopment Project”). These bonds were not general obligation bonds and were not to
be repaid from the general coffers of Harvey. Instead, they were limited obligation
bonds. Depending on the particular bond offering, the bonds were to be repaid from
dedicated tax revenue streams such as Harvey’s hotel-motel tax and sales tax revenue or
incremental tax from the Tax Increment Financing District (“Harvey TIF District”)
Harvey created for the development and construction of the Hotel Redevelopment
Project.
4.

Thus, it was important to bond investors that money raised from the bond

offerings, consistent with the stated purpose, was actually used to fund the hotel
development, since the amount of funds to repay the bonds derived from tax revenues
would be materially affected by the funding and progress of the Hotel Redevelopment
Project.
5.

Yet, unbeknownst to bond investors and contrary to representations in

Official Statements and other documents connected to the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Bond
Offerings, from in or about 2009 through in or about 2011, Harvey officials improperly
diverted at least $1.7 million of bond proceeds from these offerings into the general
operation accounts of Harvey to pay the City’s operation costs, including payroll. Letke,
Harvey’s comptroller, also received approximately $269,000 in undisclosed payments

2


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 3 of 29 PageID #:3

derived from bond proceeds and other proceeds earmarked for the Hotel Redevelopment
Project. Bond investors were thus materially misled about the purpose and risks of the
bonds they purchased from Harvey
6.

During the relevant period, Defendant Letke was the Comptroller of

Harvey, for which he and a firm he controlled, Letke & Associates, Inc., received
$1,080,403. In addition, Defendant Letke and his firm Letke & Associates served as a
financial advisor to Harvey in connection with the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Bond Offerings.
7.

Harvey intends to make a new issuance of limited obligation bonds as

early as June 25, 2014 (the “2014 Proposed Bond Offering”). The draft offering
documents for the 2014 Proposed Bond Offering make materially misleading statements
about the intended use of bond proceeds and the risks of investing in Harvey’s municipal
bonds, while omitting to state the bond proceeds from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 Bond
Offerings already had been misused.
8.

Through the activities alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants, directly

or indirectly, have engaged in transactions, acts, practices or courses of business which
constitute violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15
U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] promulgated
thereunder.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred by

Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b)] and Section 21(d) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)] seeking to restrain and enjoin permanently the

3


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 4 of 29 PageID #:4

Defendants from engaging in the acts, practices, transactions and courses of business
alleged herein, and for such other equitable relief as may be appropriate or necessary for
the benefit of investors.
10.

The Commission also seeks a final judgment ordering Defendant Letke to

disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest thereon, and ordering Letke to
pay civil money penalties pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §
78u(d)(3)] and Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t(d)].
11.

The Commission also seeks a temporary restraining order prohibiting

Harvey from offering or selling its own municipal securities, and permanent injunctive
relief enjoining Harvey from offering or selling its own municipal securities for a period
of five years, unless it first retains an Independent Consultant appointed by the Court to
review Harvey’s municipal security disclosure policies and procedures, and Harvey’s
procedures, controls and personnel for the proper use of bond proceeds, and implements
any of the Consultant’s recommendations for improvement.
12.

The Commission also seeks to temporarily restrain, and permanently

enjoin, Defendant Letke from participating in any capacity in a municipal securities
offering.
13.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action, and venue lies in this District,

pursuant to Sections 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(d) and
77v(a)] and Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78u(d) and 78aa].
The Defendants, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, have made use of the means
or instruments of transportation or communication in, and the means or instrumentalities
of, interstate commerce, or of the mails, in connection with the transactions, acts,

4


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 5 of 29 PageID #:5

practices, and courses of business alleged herein. These transactions, acts, practices and
courses of business occurred in the Northern District of Illinois, where the City of Harvey
is located and where Letke resides.
14.

Defendants have, directly and indirectly, made, and are making, use of the

mails, and of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in connection with
the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
15.

There is a reasonable likelihood that Defendants will, unless enjoined,

continue to engage in the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business set forth in
this Complaint, and transactions, acts, practices and courses of business of similar purport
and object.
THE DEFENDANTS
16.

City of Harvey, Illinois is located in southern Cook County, Illinois,

about 20 miles south of downtown Chicago. The City was organized on June 18, 1891
and is a “body politic and corporate” operating under the Illinois Municipal Code. It is
governed by a City Council, comprised of a mayor, and six alderman elected from
separate wards for four year terms.
17.

Joseph T. Letke, age 55, resides in Frankfort, Illinois. He has been the

comptroller for the City of Harvey, Illinois for at least six years and in June 2008
incorporated a number of limited liability companies relating to the Hotel Redevelopment
Project, including Harvey Hotel Properties and others.
FACTS
A.

Letke, His Business, and His Relationship to the City of Harvey

5


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 6 of 29 PageID #:6

18.

Letke is a certified public accountant who is the principal shareholder of

several professional service businesses, including Alli Financial and Public Funding
Enterprises. Alli Financial was formed on May 1, 2013, as a successor corporation to
Letke & Associates. Letke also formed Public Funding Enterprises and Public Funding
Group, LLC, which both were registered municipal advisors and provided financial
advisor services regarding the issuance of municipal bonds to the City of Harvey and
other municipalities.
19.

Alli Financial provides accounting and financial consulting services to

private and municipal clients, mostly in the south suburbs of Chicago. Letke serves as the
comptroller for several of these municipalities, including the City of Harvey, and is
responsible for the accounting and financial reporting of the municipalities in which he
holds that position, as well as advising on the municipalities’ revenues, expenditures and
general financial condition. Alli Financial has accountants onsite at several
municipalities to provide accounting and comptroller services, and Alli Financial
normally bills the municipalities on an hourly basis.
20.

During the period 2008 to 2010, the City of Harvey has paid Letke and/or

his businesses a total of approximately $1.08 million for work as Harvey’s Comptroller
and for bookkeeping.
21.

Letke and/or his businesses also received disclosed compensation totaling

approximately $547,000 in his role as financial advisor to Harvey for 2008, 2009, and
2010 municipal bond offerings, as more fully set forth below.
22.

Additionally, as set forth below, Letke and/or his businesses received

approximately $269,000 in undisclosed compensation from the developer of the Hotel

6


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 7 of 29 PageID #:7

Redevelopment Project (as more fully described below) or businesses the developer
controlled. Letke served as an accountant for this developer during the pendency of the
project.
23.

In sum, from 2008 through 2010, Letke and/or his businesses received at

least $1.9 million relating to the City of Harvey. Further, Letke and his businesses have
continued to perform work for Harvey, and have been compensated for this work, from
2011 through the present.
B.

The City of Harvey’s Issuance of 2008 Bonds
24.

In August 2008, Harvey conducted a municipal bond offering (the “2008

Bond Offering”) to sell $6,025,000 of Hotel-Motel Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2008A
(the “2008 Bonds”).
25.

As part of the 2008 offering, the City and Developer entered into a

Development Agreement on August 25, 2008 (the “2008 Development Agreement”).
The 2008 Development Agreement stated that the total cost of the Hotel Redevelopment
Project was estimated to be $23 million and that the Developer would provide equity
“necessary to complete the Project.” The Agreement also stated that, without the City’s
prior consent, no liens could be placed on the Project and no affiliate of the Developer
could receive any City Funds, directly or indirectly, for work done, services provided or
material supplied for the Project.
26.

As part of the 2008 Bond Offering, Harvey provided to potential investors

an Official Statement (“2008 Official Statement”) with information regarding the
offering. The 2008 Official Statement was signed by Harvey’s Mayor and City Clerk on
behalf of Harvey.

7


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 8 of 29 PageID #:8

27.

The 2008 Official Statement stated that the 2008 Bonds were being issued

to finance: (i) a portion of the acquisition by the Developer of the project, Harvey Hotel
Properties (the “Developer”), of a parcel of property at 17040 South Halsted Street,
Harvey, Illinois (“Property”); (ii) the rehabilitation of the facilities located on the
Property “to provide for a full-service hotel and conference center” which was expected
to operate as a Holiday Inn; and (iii) to pay for administrative, financing, legal and other
costs associated with the 2008 Bond Offering. The cover page of the 2008 Official
Statement stated in pertinent part:
The Bonds are being issued for the purposes of…financing costs of
the Project described in this Official Statement, and paying
incidental expenses associated with the issuance of the Bonds….
28.

The Project for which the City of Harvey was issuing the 2008 Bonds was

the acquisition and rehabilitation of facilities on the Property within the City of Harvey.
According to the 2008 Official Statement, the Property would be improved with a fullservice Holiday Inn hotel and conference center which would include, among other
things, 239 rooms, a restaurant and lounge, an indoor pool, and 10,500 square feet of
meeting space.
29.

The 2008 Official Statement estimated that of the $6.025 million expected

to be raised through the issuance of the 2008 Bonds, approximately $5.4 million would
be used for a deposit into a fund for the Hotel Redevelopment Project and approximately
$624,000 would be used for issuance costs, including the underwriter’s compensation.
30.

The 2008 Bonds were not general obligation bonds. In other words, the

2008 Bonds were not to be repaid to investors from the general coffers of Harvey.

8


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 9 of 29 PageID #:9

31.

Instead, according to the 2008 Official Statement, the bonds were payable

solely from hotel-motel tax and sales tax revenue. On the front page of the 2008 Official
Statement, in bold, capitalized type, the 2008 Official Statement represented in pertinent
part: “The Bonds are not general obligations of the City, notwithstanding any provision
or reference contained in this Official Statement, the Series 2008 A Ordinance, or any
other bond document or transaction document; the Bonds shall be special limited
obligations of the City. The Bonds are payable solely from Hotel-Motel Tax and Sales
Revenues.”
32.

After receiving Harvey’s representations in the 2008 Official Statement

about how proceeds from the 2008 Bond Offering would be used, and how tax revenues
would be generated to repay bondholders, investors purchased a total of $6.025 million of
2008 Bonds.
C.

The City of Harvey’s Issuance of 2009 Bonds
33.

In or about August 2009, the City of Harvey conducted a municipal bond

offering (the “2009 Bond Offering”) to sell $3,000,000 of Series 2009A Bonds (the
“2009 Bonds”).
34.

As part of the 2009 Bond Offering, the City and Developer entered into a

Redevelopment Agreement dated June 22, 2009 (“2009 Redevelopment Agreement”).
The 2009 Redevelopment Agreement again stated that, without the City’s prior consent,
no liens could be placed on the Project and no affiliate of the Developer could receive
any City Funds, directly or indirectly, for work done, services provided or material
supplied for the Hotel Redevelopment Project.

9


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 10 of 29 PageID #:10

35.

As part of the 2009 Bond Offering, the City of Harvey provided to

potential investors a Bond Purchase Agreement as well as a Tax Exemption Certificate
(“2009 Tax Exemption Certificate”) with information regarding the offering. Harvey’s
Mayor signed both documents on behalf of the City.
36.

The 2009 Tax Exemption Certificate stated that the 2009 Bonds were

being issued to (i) pay a portion of the cost of the Hotel Redevelopment Project and (ii) to
pay the Costs of Issuance of the 2009 Bonds.
37.

The 2009 Tax Exemption Certificate estimated that of the $3 million

expected to be raised through the issuance of the 2009 Bonds, approximately $1.749
million would be used for the acquisition of land for the Hotel Redevelopment Project,
approximately $835,000 would be used for rehabilitation costs associated with the Hotel
Redevelopment Project, $150,000 would be used for an underwriter’s discount, and
approximately $276,000 would be used for costs of issuance of the 2009 Bonds.
38.

Like the 2008 Bonds, the 2009 Bonds were not general obligation bonds

and were not to be repaid to investors from the general coffers of Harvey. Instead,
according to the 2009 Tax Exemption Certificate, the bonds were payable solely from the
incremental tax revenue generated by a redevelopment project area within the City of
Harvey Center Street Tax Increment Finance District (the “Harvey TIF District”), where
the Hotel Redevelopment Project was located.
39.

Illinois law authorizes the use of tax increment financing, known as “TIF,”

to redevelop “blighted,” “conservation,” or “industrial park conservation areas” by
financing redevelopment project costs with incremental property tax revenues.
Incremental property tax revenue is derived from the increase in the equalized assessed

10 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 11 of 29 PageID #:11

valuation of real property within a redevelopment project area over and above the
equalized assessed valuation in effect at the time the redevelopment project area is
established.
40.

After receiving Harvey’s representations in the 2009 Tax Exemption

Certificate about how proceeds from the 2009 Bond Offering would be used, and how tax
revenues would be generated to repay bondholders, a single investor purchased a total of
$3 million of 2009 Bonds in approximately August 2009.
D.

The City of Harvey’s Issuance of 2010 Bonds
41.

In or about September 2010, the City of Harvey conducted a municipal

bond offering (the “2010 Bond Offering”) to sell $5,000,000 of Series 2010 Bonds (the
“2010 Bonds”).
42.

As part of the 2010 Bond Offering, the City of Harvey provided to

potential investors an Official Statement (“2010 Official Statement”) with information
regarding the offering. The 2010 Official Statement was signed by Harvey’s Mayor and
City Clerk on behalf of Harvey.
43.

The 2010 Official Statement stated that the 2010 Bonds were being issued

to finance: (i) the reimbursement of the Developer, for eligible costs for the Hotel
Redevelopment Project; (ii) the reimbursement of the City for advances made to the
Developer; (iii) payment of bond issuance expenses; and (iv) future costs for the Hotel
Redevelopment Project.
44.

The 2010 Official Statement estimated that of the $5 million expected to

be raised through the issuance of the 2010 Bonds, approximately $4.078 million would
be used for a deposit to a project fund for the Hotel Redevelopment Project, $500,000

11 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 12 of 29 PageID #:12

would be used for a deposit to a debt service reserve fund, and approximately $421,000
would be used for costs of issuance of the 2010 Bonds, including paying agent fees,
underwriter’s discount, legal fees, printing, and other miscellaneous costs of issuance.
45.

Like the 2008 Bonds and the 2009 Bonds, the 2010 Bonds were not

general obligation bonds and were not to be repaid to investors from the general coffers
of Harvey. Instead, according to the 2010 Official Statement, the bonds were payable
solely from the incremental tax revenue generated by a redevelopment project area within
the Harvey TIF District where the Hotel Redevelopment Project was located. The 2010
Official Statement represented in pertinent part: “The Bonds are limited obligations of the
City, payable solely from and secured by the Incremental Taxes and certain other moneys
held under the Bond Ordinance.” Thus, as with the 2008 Bonds and the 2009 Bonds, the
Hotel Redevelopment Project, and the funding and progress of the project, would affect
the amount of incremental tax revenue available to serve as the sole source of funds for
repayment to investors in the 2010 Bonds.
46.

After receiving Harvey’s representations in the 2010 Official Statement

about how proceeds from the 2010 Bond Offering would be used, and how tax revenues
would be generated to repay bondholders, a single investor purchased a total of $5
million of 2010 Bonds.
E. 	

Harvey’s and Letke’s Scheme to Misuse Bond-Related Proceeds and
Harvey’s Misrepresentations to Investors
47.

From 2008 to the present, Harvey and Letke have engaged in a scheme to

divert bond proceeds for improper purposes, including undisclosed payments to Letke
beyond what was disclosed in the bond offering documents, payroll for the City of
Harvey, and other purposes unrelated to the Hotel Redevelopment Project. As part of the
12 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 13 of 29 PageID #:13

scheme, Harvey made misrepresentations and omissions to investors about how bond
proceeds would be used and the risks associated with investments in Harvey’s municipal
bonds.
48.

In August 2008, a title company for the Hotel Redevelopment Project

disbursed $400,000 to Letke & Associates, which the offering documents for the 2008
Bonds disclosed as the firm’s fee for acting as a financial adviser to Harvey for the
offering.
49.

All of the 2008 Bond Proceeds went to pay for past due amounts on the

Hotel Redevelopment Project and none went, as it stated in the 2008 Official Statement,
to the “rehabilitation of the facilities located on the” Property to provide the full-service
Holiday Inn hotel and conference center. Approximately $3.5 million of bond proceeds
were paid on past due loans, $900,000 went for past due real estate taxes, and
approximately $1 million was for unpaid construction related costs.
50.

In addition, in violation of the 2008 Development Agreement with the

City, of the approximately $1 million in 2008 Bond Proceeds that went to unpaid
construction costs, $502,000 was disbursed to a construction company that the Developer
controlled. Letke & Associates, as the accountant and bookkeeper for both the Developer
personally and for the Hotel Redevelopment Project, was aware of this $502,000
payment.
51.

On February 17, 2009, an employee of Letke & Associates that worked

from an onsite office at the City of Harvey emailed Letke, advising him, to the extent he
did not already know, that the City was strapped financially. The employee told Letke
that in order to pay water bills, health insurance and payroll, the City might “have to dip

13 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 14 of 29 PageID #:14

into bond money.” The employee then suggested that it might be better to use restricted
funds rather than TIF bond proceeds because “[t]here’s the whole tax exempt bond
money being used for taxable items (operations) to be considered.”
52.

On February 25, 2009, shortly after the employee emailed Letke abut the

City’s lack of funds, the City transferred $290,000 from a TIF District fund to its general
operations account and then used the money to make payroll.
53.

As part of Harvey’s and Letke’s participation in the scheme to divert

bond- related proceeds, in July 2009, the City of Harvey, through Letke and another
Harvey official, sent $1.5 million from Harvey to a Letke & Associates escrow account.
Letke & Associates then paid the Developer $1 million. After receiving this payment, the
Developer made a $70,000 undisclosed payment to Letke and paid $100,000 to a woman
that had no apparent connection to the Hotel Redevelopment Project.
54.

In August 2009, as noted above, the City of Harvey distributed the 2009

Tax Exemption Certificate to investors as part of its issuance of the 2009 Bonds. The
2009 Tax Exemption Certificate stated that the purpose of the bonds was to provide
funding for the Hotel Redevelopment Project and represented that repayment of the 2009
Bonds would be affected by the funding and progress of the Hotel Redevelopment
Project. The 2009 Tax Exemption Certificate omitted to state that the Developer of the
Hotel Redevelopment Project had misused a portion of the proceeds from the 2008 Bond
Offering, as well as other City proceeds, by making undisclosed payments to Letke, the
Developer himself, and an unrelated woman, as set forth in the preceding paragraphs
herein.

14 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 15 of 29 PageID #:15

55.

In August 2009, the Mayor of the City of Harvey directed the underwriter

for the 2009 Bond Offering to disburse $72,000 to Letke & Associates for its role as a
financial adviser to Harvey on the Offering.
56.

The City of Harvey materially misled investors by, among other things,

stating in the 2009 Tax Exemption Certificate that Harvey was issuing the bonds for the
Hotel Redevelopment Project while omitting to state that bond-related and other proceeds
earmarked for the Hotel Redevelopment Project already had been misused.
57.

In August 2009, as part of the scheme to divert bond proceeds, the City of

Harvey used $600,000 in 2009 Bond proceeds for the City of Harvey’s general expenses,
and not for the Hotel Redevelopment Project. On August 9, 2009, $600,000 of 2009
Bond proceeds was transferred to the City of Harvey’s general bank account. On that
same day, the City withdrew $420,000 from its general bank account to meet Harvey’s
payroll obligations.
58.

In September 2009, the City of Harvey transferred $150,000 to the

Developer. The Harvey City Council resolution authorizing this payment characterized
this payment as a loan to the Developer. The City’s Director of Planning and
Development emailed a memorandum entitled “Release of TIF Funds” to the
Comptroller’s office, the Mayor, the assistant to the Mayor, and the City’s Economic
Development and Finance Council Committees. The City employee cautioned that the
purported loan had “no request for funds, paperwork, no itemization of what the monies
will be utilized for and there is no justification given that the monies will meet state
regulations regarding TIF eligible expenses.” She requested that a stop payment be
placed on the $150,000 check, “but to no avail.”

15 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 16 of 29 PageID #:16

59.

In November 2009, the City of Harvey transferred an additional $100,000

to the Developer. The City does not appear to have received any documentation
verifying that the $100,000 met state regulations regarding TIF eligible expenses.
60.

In February 2010, in another act in furtherance of the scheme to divert

bond proceeds, the City of Harvey used an additional $300,000 in 2009 Bond proceeds
for the City of Harvey’s general expenses, not for the Hotel Redevelopment Project. On
February 12, 2010, $300,000 of 2009 Bond proceeds was transferred to the City of
Harvey’s general bank account. It appears that Harvey used this money for Harvey’s
general operations.
61.

Also in February 2010, the Developer obtained a loan for $2.2 million

ostensibly for the Hotel Redevelopment Project. In so doing, the Developer placed a lien
on the Property without prior authorization from the City, as required in the 2008
Development Agreement and 2009 Redevelopment Agreement. Letke apparently was
aware that the Developer placed this lien on the property, because he is the registered
agent for the Developer’s companies and made filings with the Illinois Secretary of State
relating to the loan.
62.

The Developer paid Letke & Associates an undisclosed $30,000 from the

$2.2 million loan proceeds received in February 2010.
63.

In September 2010, as noted above, the City of Harvey issued the 2010

Bonds and distributed the 2010 Official Statement to investors in the bonds. The City of
Harvey received $1 million of the 2010 Bond Proceeds. It is possible this money was
intended to repay the City in part for the $1.5 million loan it made to the Developer in
July 2009. However, no documentation appears to exist supporting either the $1 million

16 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 17 of 29 PageID #:17

transfer or the portion of the $1.5 million loan that was diverted to Letke and the woman
with no apparent connection to the Hotel Redevelopment Project, as discussed above.
64.

As noted above, the 2010 Official Statement stated that the purpose of the

bonds was to provide funding for the Hotel Redevelopment Project and represented that
repayment of the 2010 Bonds would be affected by the funding and progress of the Hotel
Redevelopment Project. The 2010 Official Statement also set forth a variety of Risk
Factors related to the risk that the Harvey TIF District would not generate a sufficient
amount of pledged taxes such that there would be sufficient money to pay principal and
interest on the bonds when due. But the 2010 Official Statement omitted to state that the
a portion of the proceeds from Harvey’s two previous bond offerings, the 2008 and 2009
Bond Offerings, already had been diverted from the Hotel Redevelopment Project and the
TIF District.
65.

The City of Harvey materially misled investors by, among other things,

stating in the 2010 Official Statement that Harvey was issuing the bonds for the Hotel
Redevelopment Project while omitting to state that bond-related proceeds from the 2008
and 2009 Bond Offerings and other proceeds earmarked for the Hotel Redevelopment
Project already had been misused.
66.

The City of Harvey also materially misled investors by, among other

things, describing in the 2010 Official Statement the various risks that the Harvey TIF
District would be unable to generate sufficient revenues to repay investors while omitting
to state that the risk that Harvey would misuse bond proceeds had already occurred with
respect to the 2008 and 2009 Offerings as well as with other proceeds earmarked for the
Hotel Redevelopment Project within the Harvey TIF District.

67.

Also in September 2010, the Mayor of the City of Harvey directed the

trustee for the 2010 Bond Offering to disburse $75,000 of bond proceeds to Public
Funding Enterprises for Letke’s role as a financial advisor to Harvey on the Offering.
68.

In September 2010, as part of Harvey’s and Letke’s participation in the

scheme to divert bond proceeds, the City of Harvey transferred $1.87 million of the $5
million 2010 Bond proceeds to the Developer. The Developer then used $1,075,000 to
pay off an existing loan for the project and $100,000 for an undisclosed payment to Letke
& Associates. In violation of the 2008 Development Agreement and the 2009
Redevelopment Agreement, the Developer also used an additional $100,000 of the
$1,075,000 for a payment to a construction company the Developer controlled.
69.

In October 2010, as part of Letke’s participation in the scheme to divert

bond proceeds, the Developer made an additional undisclosed $49,375 payment to Letke
& Associates and an additional $75,000 prohibited payment to the construction company
the Developer controlled.
70.

In June 2011, as part of Harvey’s and Letke’s participation in the scheme

to divert bond proceeds, the City of Harvey authorized a $250,000 loan to the Developer.
The $250,000 loan was transferred from an account holding proceeds from the $5 million
2010 Bond Offering. Documentation to support that the loan met state regulations
regarding eligible TIF expenses appears not to exist. The Developer then made a $15,000
undisclosed payment to Letke & Associates, made a $30,000 prohibited payment to a
construction company controlled by the Developer, and made a $57,000 prohibited
payment to the Developer’s majority owner.

71.

In October 2011, as part of Harvey’s participation in the scheme to divert

bond proceeds, the City of Harvey used $959,000 in 2010 Bond proceeds for the City of
Harvey’s general expenses, not for the Hotel Redevelopment Project. The Mayor signed
a Project Fund Disbursement request for the funds in which he certified, among other
things, the following:
a.	 “In connection with the requested disbursement, [the City of Harvey]
hereby certifies as follows:
i.

This written requisition is for the payment of costs in connection
with the issuance of the above-referenced Bonds or the
[acquisition or construction] of the Project or reimbursement for
costs of acquisition or construction of the Project.

ii.

The [City of Harvey] and Developer have each complied with all
requirements under the Redevelopment Agreement relating to the
disbursement request.

iii.

The City Engineer has inspected the work for which payment is
requested and has confirmed that the work for which payment is
requested has been completed and payment therefore should be
approved.”

On the date the Mayor signed the disbursement request, the Hotel Redevelopment Project
already was in foreclosure.
72.

The $959,000 of 2010 Bond proceeds was transferred to the City of

Harvey’s general bank account. Harvey then used this money for its general operations.

19 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 20 of 29 PageID #:20

As the Comptroller for Harvey, Letke was responsible for recording these transactions,
with assistance from employees of Letke & Associates.
F. 	

The Failure of the Hotel Redevelopment Project
73.

As of 2014, as the result of Harvey’s and Letke’s participation in the

scheme to divert bond related proceeds, the Hotel Redevelopment Project has turned into
a fiasco for bond investors and Harvey residents. According to news reports, the
proposed Holiday Inn hotel and conference center stands as a decrepit shell. The hotel’s
façade has many holes in it, and the interior of the hotel appears gutted in places, with
dangling wires and exposed studs, according to news reports.
G. 	

Harvey’s Misrepresentations to Underwriters About the Absence of Conflicts
Of Interest
74.

In connection with the 2009 and 2010 Bond Offerings, the City of Harvey

executed a General Closing Certificate. The Mayor signed the 2009 and 2010 General
Closing Certificates, along with the City Clerk.
75.

The City of Harvey provided the General Closing Certificate to the

underwriters for the 2009 and 2010 Bond Offerings in connection with the purchase of
the bonds.
76.

The General Closing Certificates for the 2009 and 2010 Bond Offerings,

stated, in pertinent part, that “[n]of member of the City Council, no officer of the City,
and no managerial or supervisory employee of the City” is “interested, either directly or
indirectly, in his own name or in the name of any other person, association, trust or
corporation” in the borrowing evidenced by the Bonds, or the contract or contracts for the
acquisition, construction and equipping of the Hotel Redevelopment Project.

20 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 21 of 29 PageID #:21

77.

When the City of Harvey issued these General Closing Certificates in

2009 and 2010, Letke, as the Comptroller for Harvey, was an “officer” of Harvey. He
also was a “managerial or supervisory employee of Harvey, supervising the accounting
and financial employee of Harvey. Based on the undisclosed payments to Letke and/or
his businesses described herein, Letke was “interested, either directly or indirectly” in the
borrowing evidenced by the Bonds, or the contract or contracts for the acquisition,
construction and equipping of the Hotel Redevelopment Project.
78.

In light of Letke’s undisclosed interests in the borrowing evidenced by the

2009 and 2010 Bonds, and in the contracts for the Hotel Redevelopment Project,
Harvey’s representations to the underwriters in the 2009 and 2010 General Closing
Certificates about the absence of conflicts of interest were materially misleading.
H.

Harvey’s Planned Issuance of 2014 Bonds
79.

Harvey intends to issue the 2014 Proposed Bond Offering. As part of this

proposed offering of bonds (the “Proposed 2014 Bonds”), Harvey has prepared a draft
Preliminary Limited Offering Memorandum (the “2014 Draft Offering Memorandum”).
The 2014 Draft Offering Memorandum has been distributed to potential investors in the
Proposed 2014 Bonds.
80.

The 2014 Draft Offering Memorandum states that the Proposed 2014

Bonds will be issued to provide funds for: (i) construction and equipping of a 43,500
square foot grocery store (the “Grocery Store Development Project”) in a TIF district
within the City of Harvey (the “Second Harvey TIF District”); (ii) reimbursement of the
developer of the Grocery Store Development Project for a portion of the costs of the
project; and (iii) other public infrastructure and project costs.

21 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 22 of 29 PageID #:22

81.

Like the 2008 Bonds, 2009 Bonds, and 2010 Bonds, the Proposed 2014

Bonds are not general obligation bonds and are not to be repaid to investors from the
general coffers of Harvey. Instead, according to the 2014 Draft Offering Memorandum,
the bonds are to be payable solely from the incremental tax revenue generated by the tax
increment redevelopment project areas within the Second Harvey TIF District where the
Grocery Store Development Project will be located. Thus, the funding and progress of
the Grocery Store Development Project would affect the amount of incremental tax
revenue available to serve as the sole source of funds for repayments to investors in the
Proposed 2014 Bonds.
82.

The 2014 Draft Offering Memorandum also sets forth a variety of risk

factors primarily related to the risk that the real estate within the Second Harvey TIF
District, such as the proposed Grocery Store Development Project, would not generate
sufficient revenues to pay principal and interest to bondholders.
83.

The 2014 Draft Offering Memorandum omits to state that the City of

Harvey had misused a portion of the proceeds from three previous bond offerings – the
2008, 2009, and 2010 Bond Offerings – as well as other proceeds directly from the City
of Harvey, that also purportedly were for the purpose of providing funding for a
redevelopment project within a Harvey TIF District, namely, the Hotel Redevelopment
Project.
84.

The City of Harvey has materially misled prospective investors in the

2014 Proposed Bond Offering by, among other things, stating in the 2014 Draft Offering
Memorandum that Harvey intends to issue the bonds for the Grocery Store Development
Project within the Second Harvey TIF District while omitting to state that bond-related

22 


Case: 1:14-cv-04744 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/24/14 Page 23 of 29 PageID #:23

proceeds from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 Bond Offerings and other proceeds earmarked
for similar projects within another TIF District already had been misused.
85.

The City of Harvey also has materially misled prospective investors by,

among other things, describing in the 2014 Draft Offering Memorandum the various risks
that the Second Harvey TIF District would be unable to generate sufficient revenues to
repay investors while omitting to state that the risk that Harvey would misuse bond
proceeds had already occurred with respect to the 2008, 2009, and 2010 Offerings.
86.

Unlike the prior offerings in 2008, 2009 and 2010, where a third party

prepared a feasibility study for the offerings, the feasibility study for the 2014 project was
done by Letke through Public Funding Group, LLC.
87.

Letke has been involved in the drafting of the 2014 Draft Offering

Memorandum. In addition, he is acting as a financial adviser to Harvey for the proposed
issuance through Public Funding Group, LLC and will receive a fee if the bond issuance
is completed.
I.

The City of Harvey’s Current Financial Condition
88.

Harvey’s last audited financial statements were dated April 30, 2008. In

January 2014, the Illinois State Comptroller’s Office instructed an auditor to bring the
City into compliance with State law regarding annual audited financial statements.
89.

Letke wrote a recent document stating that Harvey’s current financial

condition is grave. In the document, Letke predicts that in July 2014, Harvey would be
unable to pay its bills, and by August 2014, Harvey would not be able to make payments
to bondholders. Letke described Harvey’s financial condition as a “crisis.”
