A Framework for
Human Resources Management
International Civil Service Commission

Introduction
The International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) adopted in 2000 a Framework
for Human Resources Management. It was developed by members of ICSC and its
secretariat, representatives of the organizations of the United Nations common
system and representatives of the staff.
The purpose of the Framework is to enable the organizations of the United
Nations common system to manage their human resources effectively. The philosophy
underlying it is grounded in the principles emanating from the provisions of the United
Nations Charter, namely, the independence of the international civil service and the
need for the organizations to recruit staff with the highest standards of efficiency,
competence and integrity, with due regard to the importance of recruiting the staff on
as wide a geographical basis as possible and to the equal participation of men and
women in the work of the organizations.
An overriding concern of human resources managers in the common system is
to link human resources management with organizational goals, taking into account
the external and internal forces relevant to human resources management.
The Framework includes a definition of organizational design and its impact on the
human resources management environment. It identifies the diverse yet interrelated
elements which make up human resources management in the common system. It has
six major components, some of which have a number of sub-components. Definitions,
identification of core/non-core elements, underlying principles and the linkages
between components are provided for the components and sub-components.
The Framework provides the organizations with a holistic conceptual base from
which to take action in one or more areas of human resources management reform.
As such, it can be used to form the basis of the organizations’ future work on human
resources policies and procedures.

Environmental impact on
human resources management
Forces at various levels influence changes in human resources strategies and
directions.Those with the most direct effect include changes in the nature of the
organization’s mission, work and overall policy direction. Other forces are internal to
the organization itself (its culture, work organization and management style), while still
others originate outside the organization and are related to the global economy and
other changes in society. Further impetus for change stems from the evolution of
thinking about the management of human resources (the conceptual base) and of the
practical tools available to human resources practitioners (the evolution of technology).
Above all, human resources management strategies are affected most directly by the
changing nature of the organization’s mission, work and overall strategy.
A human resources management framework does not exist in a vacuum but is
interconnected with the organization’s mission and is subject to a number of forces,
both internal and external. International organizations of the United Nations family,
however, present three additional unique features that in one way or another affect
the management of human resources:
• Their system of governance: all organizations are responsible to large numbers of
Member States which decide their missions, mandates and strategies
• Their legal status: the organizations are extraterritorial and not bound by national
legislation or international labour conventions
• Their international, multicultural nature: the organizations’ aims and activities are
global and their employees come from all parts of the world

Core elements
CORE ELEMENTS of the human resources management framework are those that
bind together the United Nations family of organizations in order to:
• Avoid any competition in the employment of staff that may result from fundamental
differences in the compensation package
• Promote common values of the international civil service
• Facilitate mobility of staff across the system

Organizational design
DEFINITION

NON-CORE ELEMENT

Organizational design is an overarching
element in the Framework. It grows out of
an organization’s mission and human
resources strategies and is the process
through which programmes and plans are
created and implemented to fulfil the aims
of the organization. It includes such areas
as job design, reporting relationships,
workload distribution and classification, as
well as strategies for motivating staff,
inspiring creativity, handling change,
improving productivity and morale etc.
The two major sub-elements of
organizational design are job design and
human resources planning.

Problems of organizational design
must be resolved by each individual
organization, rather than being
subject to any form of common
prescription across the United
Nations system, not least because of
the significant differences among
organizations’ mandates, structures,
size of workforce etc. Job design and
human resources planning are
therefore not core elements of the
common system.

JOB DESIGN,
which precedes job classification,
encompasses determination of the
content of jobs, the roles of the
incumbents of those jobs and the
relationships which exist between the
job holders and others in the
organization. The requirements of job
content determination are twofold:
it must meet the organizations’
requirements for operational efficiency
and quality service, while satisfying the
job holder’s needs in terms of interest,
challenge and accomplishment. This will
entail analysing the work that needs to
be done through process planning,
systems analysis and work study.

HUMAN RESOURCES PLANNING
involves the systematic assessment of future
staffing requirements in terms of numbers
and levels of skills and competencies and
formulation and implementation of plans to
meet those requirements. It is vital to match
human resources to the longer-term
programme needs of the organization and to
maintain an ongoing review of how to make
the best use of current and future human
resources. In the process, human resources
managers must assess how a well-trained
and flexible workforce can best be maintained
to meet the organization’s changing and
at times uncertain needs.

Compensation and benefits
DEFINITION

CORE ELEMENT

Compensation policy governs the
establishment of pay scales. It is based on
the Noblemaire and Flemming principles,
which address the need to recruit staff at
both the national and international levels.
The design of the compensation and
benefits system determines how pay is
administered and managed.

Consistent compensation policies
are required in an international civil
service to prevent organizations’
undesirable competition for staff
on the basis of disparate
compensation policies.

Employment:
Recruitment, placement and retention
DEFINITION

NON-CORE ELEMENT

Recruitment/placement is the starting
point of an organization’s overall
employment policy. It covers both hiring
new talent and reassigning serving staff,
including those on inter-agency transfer,
secondment or loan. Retention addresses
the conditions which enable staff members
to continue to serve.

While recruitment and
placement/selection should be based
on shared principles, such as merit,
geographical distribution and gender
balance, organizations should
continue to be responsible for
designing recruitment systems that
meet their unique needs.

Employment:
Contractual arrangements
DEFINITION

CORE ELEMENT

Contractual arrangements covering all
types of appointments are the tools used
by organizations to employ staff on a
short-, medium- and long-term basis.

To the extent that the compensation
package is common across
organizations

L I N K AG E S
Compensation
and benefits:
To attract
candidates for
employment of
varying duration

Recruitment and
retention:
They are the vehicle for
delivering the employment
conditions needed to attract
staff and they communicate
the expectation for
continued employment

Career
management:
Because of the career
nature of employment
conveyed in some
contracts

P R I N C I P L E S
Contractual arrangements should:

Be flexible so as to
respond to
organizational needs

10

For those with a career in
the international civil
service, be compatible
across organizations in
the area of compensation
and benefits to facilitate
inter-organizational
mobility

For those without a
career in the
international civil
service, recognize the
need for compensation
equity

Employment:
Staff well-being
DEFINITION

NON-CORE ELEMENT

An enabling work environment will result in
staff well-being. It encompasses staff
security; occupational, environmental, health
and safety standards; medical services; and
work/life programmes. Security policy
involves the physical and psychological safety
of staff and takes precedence over
organizational expediency. Accordingly,
organizations should remind Member States
of their obligation to ensure the protection
of staff at duty stations.

Because organizations’ programmatic
responses must meet local
conditions. However, common
arrangements for the protection of
life and property have been
developed by the organizations.

L I N K AG E S
Recruitment and
retention:
Policies that
enhance the quality
of work and life
attract and retain
staff

Mobility:
Staff well-being weighs
heavily in decisions to
make geographic
moves

Good
governance:
Contributes to
staff morale and
ensures equitable
treatment of staff

P R I N C I P L E S
Staff well-being should ensure the following:

Occupational health, safety
and medical programmes
should provide for
environmental safety and
overall protection to
safeguard the physical and
psychological well-being of
staff

Organizations should ensure that
Member States provide for the
legal protection of staff as
envisaged in the relevant
conventions (currently the
Conventions on privileges and
immunities and the Convention on
the Safety of United Nations and
Associated Personnel)

To be an employer of choice,
organizations should provide
for a balance between work
and family needs through
programmes that take into
account contemporary
approaches

11

Career management:
Staff development and training
DEFINITION
A career may be defined as a series or progression of work assignments within or
outside the United Nations system coupled with a continuing acquisition of skills
and experience. It encompasses the notion of a widening of competencies and
responsibilities, either in one or several professions. It normally involves several
lateral or vertical moves. Career management is the process by which a staff
member is empowered, with the support of the organization, to plan, organize and
pursue a career in an enabling environment. Staff development and training refers
to those opportunities identified by a staff member or provided by the
organization to enable staff to continue to acquire skills and experience in pursuing
careers. Staff development usually covers a broad range of activities, which may
include specific work assignments, on the job training and coaching and other
work-related developmental opportunities, while staff training is often referred to
as involving a strictly formal acquisition of skills.

NON-CORE ELEMENT
Because organizations need
mechanisms adapted to their
mission, occupations and
organizational structure

Performance
management:
Assessment of

pursuing career goals
and providing
development and
training

P R I N C I P L E S
Appropriate and effective career planning, staff development and training programmes aligned to the
competencies defined by the organization are key to the successful delivery of the organization’s work.
Such programmes should:

Be consistent with
the organization’s
goals and needs

12

Identify and develop
talent in order
to build a
high-performing,
motivated and flexible
workforce

Recognize the shared
responsibility of staff
members and
organizations in
developing career
plans

Take into account
staff members’
career plans,
performance and
achievements to
maximize their
contribution to the
organization

Career management:
Mobility
DEFINITION

CORE ELEMENT

The concept of mobility includes movement within and across organizations,
occupations and geographic locations. For the purposes of this framework, an
important aspect of mobility is the movement of staff between agencies within
the common system. Mobility increases staff versatility, provides additional
career opportunities and encourages the concept of developing a career in
the United Nations family. It strengthens the organizations’ capacity to
respond to changing needs. Mobility need not be limited to
international organizations.

To the extent that inter-agency
mobility is an underlying
premise of the international
civil service that affects all
organizations of the
common system

L I N K AG E S
Career
management:
Strengthens a
common system
culture and offers
staff opportunities
to enrich their
experience

Compensation and
benefits:
offer incentives, inter
alia, for geographical
relocations in line with
organizations’
operational needs

Staff
well-being:
These policies
directly influence
the willingness of
staff to relocate

Performance
management:
Experience acquired
through mobility is
taken into account in
placement decisions

P R I N C I P L E S
Mobility is an underlying premise of the international civil service which promotes shared principles and
values. Organizations’ mobility requirements may vary depending on their structure, size and mandate.
Mobility programmes should:

Provide for the movement
of staff within and across
international organizations,
and to the extent possible,
to and from national civil
services and public and
private sector institutions

Where there is the
expectation of return,
provide for reabsorption
within the organization in
such a manner that the
organization benefits from
the staff member’s
experience

Be a condition of
employment when required
by the organization

13

Career management:
Performance management
DEFINITION

NON-CORE ELEMENT

Performance management is an integrated system, including
organizational design, work planning, assessments and feedback
designed to maximize performance at the individual, team, unit
and organizational levels to motivate and to develop staff.
Award and recognition systems form part of this system. They
provide for monetary and non-monetary awards in recognition
of meritorious performance and other noteworthy
accomplishments.

Because to be effective,
performance management must
be responsive to the needs of
the particular organization

L I N K A G E S
Placement and
retention:
Assessments of
performance are used
in both processes.

Identify performance
expectations that are tied
to the organization’s goals
and objectives and at the
same time ensure that
staff can fully develop and
utilize their capabilities

Career management, staff
development and training:
Provide the basis for staff to
make informed decisions about
career aspirations and for
managers to make decisions
about the development and
training needs of staff

Provide for the
recognition of
performance as an
important tool for
improving productivity
and morale at all levels

Compensation
and benefits:
Provide incentives for
staff to excel

Employ
assessment
tools which can
be readily
understood and
easily
communicated

Ensure that
assessment tools
measure
performance that is
consistent with the
organization’s goals

P R I N C I P L E S
The effective management of performance is essential to the overall functioning of the organization.
Performance management programmes should:

Provide for dialogue and
employ the concept of
continuing feedback on
performance

14

Emphasize the importance of
clear communication at all
levels with regard to the
concept of performance
management and its modalities,
including expectations,
assessments and consequences
of performance

Include monetary and nonmonetary awards that are based
on a transparent and widely
disseminated policy and are clearly
tied to the performance or event
concerned; monetary awards
should not replace the need for a
competitive remuneration package

Good governance:
Management style
DEFINITION

NON-CORE ELEMENT

Management style is instrumental in
reinforcing delegation of responsibilities
and establishes reporting relationships to
ensure consultation, cooperation and
partnership in decision-making processes
at the lowest practical levels to enable staff
and management to perform their duties
in a professional, impartial, transparent,
coherent and accountable manner.

Because management style, to be
effective, must be responsive to the
particular organizational culture,
work requirements and mandates

L I N K AG E S
Performance
management:
Managers and staff are
accountable for the way
they communicate and
conduct business within
the organization

Staff well-being:
Directly affects staff
morale and
productivity

P R I N C I P L E S
Effective management style provides leadership that upholds the values of and creates commitment to the organization,
builds the capacity for improved productivity and creates an environment that brings out the best in the staff and recognizes
the value of multiculturalism. In an environment that values managerial excellence, executives and managers should:

Be held accountable
through performance
management for creating a
work environment that
promotes communication
and cooperation, and
engenders working
methods that are efficient,
effective, fair, impartial and
transparent

Empower staff to participate
in decisions affecting the
organization

Engage in continual
Demonstrate ethical
learning and apply
values and build and
techniques to improve maintain partnerships by
their own management
gaining the trust and
skills to meet the
respect of those with
challenges of a dynamic
whom they work
work environment

15

Good governance:
Role of staff representatives
DEFINITION

NON-CORE ELEMENT

The role of staff representatives is defined
as full involvement in and contributing on
all matters relating to personnel/human
resources policies and practices.

Because effective staff representation
is covered by rules and regulations
that must meet the needs of the
organization and staff

L I N K AG E S
The role of staff representatives is linked to all
aspects of conditions of service because staff
representatives have an important role in the
development and implementation of personnel
policies and procedures in these areas

P R I N C I P L E S

Organizations should
recognize the legitimate
role of staff representatives
in representing the views of
staff on all matters relating
to personnel/human
resources policies and
practices

16

Organizations should ensure
that staff representatives are
fully informed on matters
affecting conditions of service
and consulted on those
related to personnel/human
resources policies and
practices

Organizations should ensure
that appropriate mechanisms
are established to offer the
opportunity for staff
representatives to participate
in and influence decisions
affecting personnel/human
resources policies and
practices

Good governance:
Administration of justice
DEFINITION

CORE ELEMENT

The administration of justice is an internal
system that guarantees due process and
provides staff with the means to raise
grievances and appeal administrative
decisions.

To the extent that decisions of the
Administrative Tribunals affect core
elements of the human resources
framework

L I N K AG E S
The administration of justice is linked to all human
resources elements in that it provides mechanisms
for appealing administrative decisions, respecting
regulations and rules, and providing due process
and equity

P R I N C I P L E S
Each organization should
provide internal
administrative procedures
which respect due process
so that the executive head
may take decisions that are
fair, equitable and
consistent with law and
statutes

Staff have a right to effective
defence, including
representation in relevant
internal processes

17

Human resources
information management
DEFINITION

CORE ELEMENT

Human resources information
management is the design, development
and maintenance of an integrated system
for gathering and analysing workforce data
and forecasting trends, as a basis for
decision-making and policy development.

To the extent that information on
human resources needs to be
compatible across organizations for
effective policy development in the
common system

L I N K A G E S
Human resources information management is linked
to all elements of the Framework, in that it
underpins and supports all aspects of human
resources management

P R I N C I P L E S
Human resources information system policies should provide for:

Ownership by
human resources
specialists of the
design,
development and
maintenance of
the system

18

A comprehensive
and integrated
information
strategy

Relevant, complete,
compatible, valid
and current
information about
the total workforce
and its productivity

An interface with Keeping abreast
the organization’s
of current
planning,
technology
budgeting, finance
and human capital
functions

Ethics/Standards of conduct
DEFINITION

CORE ELEMENT

Although organizations’ internal cultures
may vary, they face similar ethical
challenges. Standards for ethical conduct
promote common values and define the
behaviour and performance expected of
international civil servants.

Because they promote a common
system of values and ethics that are
essential to an international
civil service

L I N K A G E S
Ethics/standards of conduct are linked to all
elements of the Framework because they are
inherently part of the overall human resources
management strategy

P R I N C I P L E S
Ethics/standards of conduct should:

Be clear and be
reflected in the
legal framework
of the
organization

Be brought to the
attention of
the staff on a
recurring basis

Enjoy demonstrated Be reinforced
commitment on
through
the part of the
management and
leadership
human resources
practices that are
transparent

State the staff
members’ rights
and obligations
when confronted
with wrongdoing in
relation to the
organization

Be supported
by effective
procedures and
mechanisms
to ensure
accountability
