MR. GOMEZ:

MR. GRAHAM:

Let's get started.

We do have a quorum.
All right.

Hello, everyone.

I'm

Steve Graham.

my third term.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you.

I am a partner at the

12

I am your co-chair.

So, Sara, do you want to give a 30-second -or --

MS. HANKS:

All right.

I'm -- I am unable to

Catherine, nice to see you, and Michael.

23

Michael doesn't bowl, but we love you anyway.

24

guess we're waiting for Greg Yadley who is stuck in

25

Florida.

So hopefully he made it out.

And I

MR. GOMEZ:

He will make it.

I think he's

actually in the tarmac, Reagan right now, so he'll be

MR. GRAHAM:

So it's --

So to the rest of you, welcome.

10

All of you are here because you represent a cross-section

11

of those directly affected by or interested in or are

12

otherwise qualified to provide advice to the Commission

13

and its rules, regulations and policies as they relate to

14

small business capital formation.

15

working with you to make a difference in this area, and

16

thank you in advance for your time and efforts.

17

you who are new will soon realize the level of importance

18

of the assistance given to this committee by the SEC

staff.

traveling, so he sends his regrets.

2

Sara, do you want to introduce Chair White?

3

MS. HANKS:

Yes, we are now going to hear from

4

Chair Mary Jo White.

Chair White was appointed in March

5

2013 by President Obama to serve as the 31st chair of the

6

SEC and also the third consecutive woman to serve in that

7

position.

experience as a federal prosecutor and securities lawyer.

She arrived at the SEC with decades of

9

Prior to serving as the chair of the SEC, Chair White

10

was the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New

11

York, the only woman to hold that position in the 200-

12

plus year history of the office and the chair of the

13

litigation department at Debevoise & Plimpton in New

14

York.

15

Thank you, Chair White.

CHAIR WHITE:

Thank you very much, Sara.

extend a very warm welcome to all of our new committee

20

members as well as the members who are returning.

I think I've shaken everyone's

If I haven't, I will later.

And let me just

This committee has been a continuing source of

22

valuable expertise and advice to the Commission on a

23

variety of important issues as reflected, I think, in the

24

Commission's renewal of the committee's charter last

25

year.

You don't need me to tell you, obviously, that

Page 9
1

small businesses play a crucial role in our nation's

2

economy, and this committee's help to ensure that the

3

views of small business owners, investors and other

4

stakeholders in this community are clearly heard loud and

5

clear here at the Commission.

role, and thank you for that role.

7

So that I see as your

And I know from your impressive bios that I'm

8

certain that this newly constituted membership will

9

continue to the significant contributions we've had in

10

the past.

11

this, raise unique insights and experiences in running,

12

nurturing, advising and -- or investing in small and

13

emerging companies.

14

with multiple demands on your time, and we really

15

sincerely appreciate your service on this committee.

16

Each of you really does, as Steve alluded to

We know you have very busy schedules

I'd also like to add a special thanks to Co-

17

Chairs Steve Graham and Sara Hanks for their willingness

18

to lead the committee and also you'll permit me to extend

19

an internal thank you to the staff of the division of

20

corporation finance, in particular Betsy Murphy,

21

Sebastian Gomez and Julie Davis for their heard work in

22

supporting the committee's activities and helping to

23

organize, obviously, the meeting today.

24
25

I know you have a full agenda, which you're
anxious to get to, and so I'll just try to give a very

Page 10
1

quick update on our activities in a few areas of

2

particular importance to you, including some that were

3

actually the subject of recommendations from this

4

committee last year.

5

Starting with the JOBS Act rulemakings, as you

6

know, last year the Commission completed all of its major

7

rulemakings under the JOBS Act, including Regulation A+

8

and crowdfunding, Sara.

9

effective in June 2015, issuers have publicly filed over

Since Regulation A+ became

10

60 offering statements with the Commission.

11

these issuers and others have, as you might imagine,

12

taken advantage of the rule that allows for nonpublic

13

staff review of draft offering statements before publicly

14

filing.

15

Some of

The crowdfunding rules will become effective on

16

May 16.

17

have filed with us to register to serve as intermediaries

18

in crowdfunding transactions.

19

excitement about these new avenues for capital raising,

20

and we are keeping a very close eye on how these markets

21

develop.

22

And in anticipation, a number of funding portals

There's a lot of

In October of last year, at the same time,

23

actually, we adopted regulation crowdfunding, the

24

Commission proposed changes to Securities Act Rule 147

25

for intrastate offerings and Rule 504 of Regulation D.

Page 11
1

The proposed changes are part of our efforts to assist

2

smaller companies with capital formation while obviously

3

maintaining investor protections.

4

year recommended that the Commission modernize.

5

Securities Act Rule 147 to facilitate state-based

6

crowdfunding initiatives.

7

fully considered in developing these proposed rules,

8

which are outstanding.

Your committee last

And that recommendation was

9

As you know, I think most of you, the proposal

10

taking account of the internet age, would modernize Rule

11

147 to facilitate intrastate offerings, including state-

12

based crowdfunding offerings, which would be sold to

13

residents of a particular state.

14

update Rule 504 to permit offerings up to $5 million in a

15

12-month period and would make it consistent with other

16

provisions of Regulation D, including a bad actor

17

disqualification provision.

18

The proposal would also

Comment period on these proposals closed in

19

January, and the staff is reviewing the comments received

20

and developing recommendations for final rules for the

21

Commission's consideration.

22

On the topic of accredited investor, obviously

23

that definition is a very important subject for us and

24

for you and for many across the small business community

25

and elsewhere.

It's of particular interest to this

Page 12
1

committee and in making recommendations last year this

2

committee urged that the primary -- always wise advice --

3

that the primary goal of the Commission's review of this

4

definition should be to do no harm to the private

5

offering ecosystem by constricting the number of

6

investors who would qualify as accredited.

7

recommended, including within the definition, those

8

investors who meet a test of sophistication.

9

You also

In late December a staff report was issued that

10

analyzes really various approaches for modifying the

11

definition and provide staff recommendations for

12

potential updates and modifications.

13

file to receive the public's feedback on the report, and

14

the issues and recommendations in it, and we encouraging

15

all interested parties to give us feedback.

16

There's a comment

Simplified disclosure for smaller issuers.

17

Last year this committee also put forward recommendations

18

regarding disclosure by smaller issuers, including some

19

changes in the disclosure rules for smaller companies as

20

well as expanding the number of companies that qualify as

21

smaller reporting companies under our existing rules that

22

permit certain scale disclosures.

23

As you know, again, I think the staff in

24

Division of Corporation Finance is advancing its

25

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, which includes

Page 13
1

consideration of the disclosure requirements for smaller

2

companies.

3

mandates under the FAST Act to update and simplify our

4

disclosure requirements.

5

area quite actively continues.

6

We also now have, as of December, additional

So obviously our work in this

The committee also provided a recommendation

7

regarding the regulation of finders and other

8

intermediaries in small business capital formation

9

transactions.

10

Staff in the Division of Trading and

Markets continues to review this issue.

11

The Section 4(a)(1 1/2) exemption, again, the

12

committee last year supported formalizing by rule or

13

statute the so-called Section 4(a)(1 1/2) exemption, to

14

allow certain shareholders who may not be able to rely on

15

Rule 144 to resell their shares received in a private

16

transaction.

17

it passed the RAISE Act in December as part of the FAST

18

Act.

19

This issue was addressed by Congress when

And I understand, Steve and Sara, that you'll

20

be discussing the latest developments on this topic later

21

today, and I really do look forward to hearing your

22

thoughts in light of the changes made by Congress.

23

Just very briefly on market structure, we

24

appreciate, the Commission, that while market structure

25

may not fit all companies and that our market structure

Page 14
1

must promote capital formation for smaller companies

2

while also obviously providing for robust investor

3

protections.

4

program that will be implemented this year to help assess

5

the effective tick sizes on market quality for smaller

6

companies.

7

recommendation was to make some of those changes

8

permanent rather than as part of a pilot, you should know

9

how important your views were to the Commission's

10

That is why we are conducting a pilot

While I know that this committee's

decision to undertake the tick-size pilot.

11

We also continue to study and remain receptive

12

to innovative industry efforts designed to facilitate

13

secondary market liquidity for smaller companies.

14

wasn't quite as brief as I'd intended.

15

there.

16

and informed contributions from this committee on all of

17

the topics I've mentioned as well as others.

18

of your agenda is, as usual, a good one.

19

it, you'll first be discussing the current landscape for

20

small and emerging companies seeking to raise capital and

21

then reviewing what the current data shows about the

22

extent of capital raising by small businesses through

23

unregistered securities offerings.

24
25

So I

So I'll stop

I really do look forward to continued thoughtful

The focus

As I understand

As the avenues for capital raising are changing
and evolving -- and indeed they are -- I think it's

Page 15
1

critical to be continuously looking at what's working,

2

what barriers may be preventing the facilitation of

3

capital formation and how investors are faring and being

4

protected in these new markets.

5

interested in today's presentations and discussions as

6

I'm sure you will be.

7

So again, I'll be keenly

So now I will stop by thanking you again for

8

your service on this very important committee.

9

you.

10

MS. HANKS:

Thank you, Chair White.

Thank

And thank

11

you in general for the SEC's attitude to this committee

12

and helpfulness.

13

We're now going to hear from Commissioner Kara

14

Stein.

15

2013.

16

a staff director for the securities subcommittee of the

17

Senate Banking Committee where she worked on many

18

financial services, including the legislation that became

19

the Dodd-Frank Act and the JOBS Act.

She's been a commissioner of the SEC since August
Prior to serving as a commissioner, she served as

20

Commissioner Stein.

21

COMMISSIONER STEIN:

22

Good morning to everyone.

Thank you, Sara.
I want to welcome

23

both the continuing members and the new members of the

24

Advisory Committee on small and emerging companies.

25

looking forward to hearing from you today.

I'm

You bring a

Page 16
1

lot of energy to us.

2

sort of count on you to tell us what's going on in real

3

life.

4

of lawyers, a lot of accountants, and we don't

5

necessarily understand what's happening on the ground.

6

So your role is very, very important to us, and I hope

7

you all speak freely and have robust discussions because

8

that helps us as we try to formulate policy.

9

particular policy in how it might affect small and

10
11

You're doing this pro bono, and we

Sometimes we get a little egg-heady here.

A lot

In

emerging businesses.
I want to thank our Office of Small Business

12

Policy in the Division of Corporation Finance for putting

13

this together.

14

through an agenda that will use your time as well as

15

possible while your with us.

16

They spent a lot of time trying to work

So this committee has the important task of

17

providing advice and recommendations to the Commission

18

regarding privately-held small businesses and publicly

19

traded companies with a market capitalization of less

20

than $250 million.

21

have an opportunity to examine a variety of novel issues

22

impacting small and emerging companies.

23

I think this year the committee will

As the chair mentioned, how will Reg A+ and Reg

24

Crowdfunding work in practice?

25

we can develop to measure whether or not these new

What are the best metrics

Page 17
1

regulations are effective both with respect to their

2

impact on small businesses as well as on investors?

3

Which capital raising options work best for the firms

4

that form a part of the small and emerging company

5

landscape?

6

envisioned by some of the new mandates under the JOBS Act

7

or other acts do not work in the manner they were

8

intended.

9

confronts people's best intentions.

10

It may be that the case that the fixes

So this goes back to where reality sort of

So I'm curious as we move forward this year

11

about your recommendations for helping us to understand

12

and study what's happening in the actual market.

13

I think on a related point, are there

14

asymmetries in access to capital raising options among

15

small and emerging companies?

16

getting funding?

17

including the options available under Reg A+ and

18

crowdfunding, are they known, and are they accessible on

19

fair terms?

20

support the diversity of entrepreneurial talent that

21

exists behind many of these small businesses.

22

forward to discussions -- examine how women and minority-

23

owned small business ventures are faring and how the

24

Commission can help.

25

Which companies are

Are capital raising opportunities,

And if not, why not?

How can we best

I look

Finally, I look forward to the discussion today

Page 18
1

on the data, size and scope of the small business capital

2

raising through traditional public offerings as compared

3

to unregistered, private securities offerings.

4

relative dollar amount of capital raising in the private

5

markets in 2014 eclipsing that of the public market, we

6

should examine what this means in particular for small

7

and emerging companies.

With the

8

Also, are small businesses receiving within the

9

private markets the funding support they need to grow and

10

eventually graduate to the public markets?

11

forward to your best thoughts today and the continuing

12

discussion as the year progresses.

13

for your public service.

So I look

And again, thank you

14

MS. HANKS:

15

Now we'd like to introduce the SEC staff that

Thank you, Commissioner Stein.

16

will be assisting the committee and assisting the

17

committee very well I might say.

18

Betsy Murphy, associate director of the SEC's Division of

19

Corporation Finance, and Betsy's going to introduce the

20

rest of the staff.

21

MS. MURPHY:

They're headed today by

Good morning.

Before going any

22

further, I'm going to recite the standard disclaimer that

23

any views expressed by an SEC staff member today are

24

solely those of the speaker and do not necessarily

25

reflect the views of the Commission or any other member

Page 19

of the Commission staff.

2

extend a very warm welcome to all of you and thank you

3

for serving on the committee and for taking the time to

4

be here today to share your experience, insights and

5

expertise with the Commission and the public.

grateful for your service.

have now that is literally a mom-and-pop real estate

business run out of a house -- room in their home to

working with Forbes 400 individuals.

I grew up in the Carolinas, so

It's diversified

Page 24

and varied, and I've done a lot of things, and it may

2

make me an expert on none of them, or it may just give me

3

a diverse background.

4

I don't know which.

I'm awed to be here, much less to think that

5

the commissioners are listening to me for advice.

6

you for having me, and it is an honor to be here.

it is a national organization and we actually just had

I'm the state director there.

And

10

our meeting here two weeks ago in D.C. and I told

11

everybody then, and they started saying, oh, well, I need

12

to sit down and talk about -- oh, I have another client,

13

this is what they're running into.

14

wait until I had my first meeting.

15

And I told them to

But no, I am very excited to be here.

I have

16

experience in both private and public sector.

17

worked with several different federal agencies, so have a

where I worked on corporate governance rules and listing

standards.

it's kind of varied.

And then my career sounds kind of ADD, but

6

Then I was the general counsel of a dark pool

broker-dealer, and then I became the general counsel of

Second Market, which was, at that point in time, putting

9

its toes in the private company space and that's really

been my focus for six, seven years.

I look forward to learning and contributing.

midsized businesses.

I have a pretty traditional career.

I'm an accountant by trade, went up through the normal

18

public accounting ranks, did all the corporate reporting,

19

compliance audits, all of that.

20

Got tired of that world and I thought there was

21

a little bit more relevance in the small business world

22

and foolishly just went out and started -- did corporate

23

for a while, GE, all that stuff.

24

decided to jump into small business world knowing

25

absolutely nothing about what it was really like to start

And then foolishly

Page 26
1

a small business, but I thought I did because in my

2

corporate life that's what I used to do.

3

was really hard to start a business when you didn't have

problems across the United States that I see every day in

our business life.

14

what it's actually like to start a business through our

clients, and actually in LA people were pretty excited

that I was going to sit on this board.

It's

They felt that the SEC sometimes has something

18

for them that has no relevance in the small business

life.

20

honored to be here, I'm excited to learn what's

happening, and I'm proud to be able to give a lot of good

input, hopefully, as far as the people who are slugging

it out on the streets.

MR. PIECIAK:

25

So we started the education process.

Good morning.

So I'm

I'm Mike Pieciak.

I began my career working with small businesses at

Page 27
1

Skadden Arps doing M&A transactions and such.

2

two years ago I returned home to Vermont where I actually

3

do work with small businesses on a regular basis working

4

with our state-based crowdfunding initiatives and other

5

ways that we assist small businesses.

6

commissioner of securities there, and I serve also as the

7

chair of the North American Securities Administrators

8

Association, corporation finance section, where we deal

9

with issues affecting small businesses and larger

10

businesses at the state level across the country.

11

I'm happy to be back on the committee.

12
13

MR. GRAHAM:

I'm the deputy

Well, thank you all.

This is going to be great.

But about

And

Impressive.

As Chair White indicated,

14

we're going to spend some time today beginning -- to lay

15

the foundation for our term.

16

to address the framework within which we are dealing, the

17

nature of that universe, future steps, and of course your

18

ideas.

19

Roughly the agenda is going

So we all understand how critical it is for

20

small businesses to be able to access capital.

21

any number of approaches.

22

all of them.

23

securities side of the equation, and so therefore that is

24

the focus of this committee.

25

There are

I think we're familiar with

The SEC's mission is to cover the

Our committee's charter and bylaws provide that

Page 28
1

the committee's objective is to provide the Commission

2

with advise on its rules, regulations, policies and

3

policies with regard to its mission of protecting

4

investors, maintaining fair, orderly and efficient

5

markets and facilitating capital formation for that group

6

that Commissioner Stein defined for us just a few minutes

7

ago, namely small and emerging companies, the issuance of

8

those securities, trading in those securities and public

9

reporting and corporate governance.

10

For context as we do our work, we'd like to

11

spend some time getting a better understanding of the

12

size and scope of the nonregistered market.

13

morning, we'll hear from the SEC's Division of Economic

14

and Risk Analysis and to research organizations regarding

15

the markets and the data currently being captured.

16

afternoon, we will turn to SEC initiatives and the

17

continuing legislative activity in Congress.

18

So this

This

For additional context, we thought it would be

19

good to present a quick overview of the regulatory

20

landscape.

21

might be helpful to just kind of refocus in the baseline.

22

This will be familiar to most of you, but it

So regardless whether security is equity, debt

23

or a more exotic instrument, a basic fundamental of the

24

federal securities law is that every offer and sale of

25

securities needs to be either registered or exempt from

Page 29
1

registration pursuant to whether the exemption is the

2

1933 Act.

3

Turning to the public side, a number of small

4

and emerging companies choose to go public and register

5

their securities with the SEC.

6

companies subject to ongoing reporting obligations.

7

Since Congress passed the JOBS Act, most new public

8

companies start as emerging growth companies, and this

9

status, of course, allows a company to follow scaled

These become reporting

10

requirements for disclosure and audit of financial

11

statements, not to have to provide auditor attestation

12

under SOX 404(b) and choose not to become subject to

13

certain changes in accounting standards.

14

This status will continue for the first five

15

years after a company's IPO or if its total gross

16

revenues are doing a more -- has issued more than a

17

billion in nonconvertible debt in the past three years or

18

becomes a large, accelerated filer, namely its public

19

float is $700 million or more.

20

Prior iterations of this committee have also

21

been interested in the definition of smaller reporting

22

company.

23

reporting company if its public float is less than $75

24

million.

25

a company has simplified disclosure and reporting

Currently a company qualifies as a smaller

Qualifying as a smaller reporting company means

Page 30
1

requirements, including being exempt from certain

2

disclosure requirements.

3

Last term this committee recommended that the

4

Commission revise the definition to include companies

5

with a public float of up to 250 million.

6

this would be a revision of the definition of accelerated

7

filer such that the auditor attestation requirement under

8

404(b) would no longer apply to companies with a public

9

float between 75 million and 250 million.

Related to

And of course

10

revision to the rules also would require revision of the

11

rules to provide small reporting companies with the same

12

disclosure combinations that are currently being made

13

available to emerging growth companies.

14

We expect the term of the committee will -- we

15

expect that this term the committee will continue to

16

focus on these definitions and other ways to make the

17

environment more conducive for small IPOs as well as the

18

combinations for small companies that are already

19

publicly traded.

20
21
22

Turning to the private side of the equation,
Sara.
MS. HANKS:

Yeah, so continuing Securities Law

23

101, especially for those who are listening at home, just

24

as a reminder, Steve mentioned that the offerings must be

25

registered or exempt.

And if your offering doesn't fit

Page 31
1

within one of the exemptions that I'm going to talk

2

about, either you're registered or you're breaking the

3

law.

4

register or you're going to fit within one of these

5

exemptions.

6

Some of them are driven by the JOBS Act.

7

they're very new and, as Commissioner Stein mentioned,

8

we're keeping an eye on how they're developing.

9

these are going to be the subject of discussions by this

10
11

This is kind of a binary thing.

So you're going to

And some of these exemptions are very new.
And because

A lot of

committee over the forthcoming term.
So just a reminder, Securities Act Section

12

4(a)(2) and I think there's plenty of people who are old

13

enough here that they're constantly saying 4(2) instead

14

of 4(a)(2).

15

exemption that exempts transactions by an issuer not

16

involving any public offering.

17

of offerings under this provision, as far as we know --

18

and this is going to be a very important thing that we're

19

talking about with respect to data and how much data we

20

capture -- the vast majority of these offerings are done

21

under Regulation D and more specifically Rule 506 which

22

is a safe harbor under Section 4(a)(2).

23

So forgive me if I do that.

That's the

The overwhelming majority

Rule 506 comes in two flavors.

506(b) is what

24

those of us who started doing -- practicing law in the

25

'80s were working with.

That's a traditional Regulation

Page 32
1

D offering.

2

privately, no limit on the amount of money a company can

3

raise or the number of accredited investors.

4

solicitation allowed under this exemption, so use of

5

internet is somewhat limited.

And that allows companies to raise money

No general

6

Pursuant to the JOBS Act, this is one of the

7

new ones, the SEC promulgated Rule 506(c) which allows

8

companies to generally solicit potential investors over

9

the internet so long as all of the purchasers are

10

accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable

11

steps to verify their status as accredited investors.

12

And we're looking forward to hearing data today about how

13

and to the extent to which these exemptions are being

14

used for private placement.

15

There's another private placement that I think

16

we do have to mention even though must companies that we

17

deal with are not going to be using it, Rule 144(a),

18

essentially a private placement made under Section

19

4(a)(2) to underwriters immediately followed by resales

20

to large institutional investors.

21

used by larger companies.

22

Like I say, mostly

Intrastate offerings, there is an exemption

23

from registration for intrastate offerings.

24

Securities Act Section 3(a)(11), the Commission adopted

25

Rule 147 that we talked about earlier in 1974 as a safe

Section --

Page 33
1

harbor for companies seeking to meet the requirements of

2

the 3(a)(11) exemption.

3

is the ability -- which we're going to keep coming back

4

to I think a lot over the course of the term -- is

5

securities law applies to offers as well as sales.

6

under old 147, you could only offer to -- and potential

7

investors in your own state, which, again, limited the

8

ability to use the internet.

9

One of the restrictions of that

And

Last September the committee -- this committee

10

recommended to the Commission that it modernize Rule 147,

11

and October 30, 2015, which Chair White had mentioned,

12

the Commission proposed amendments that would modernize

13

existing Rule 147 by establishing a completely new

14

exemption from registration that would help to facilitate

15

capital formation, including offerings relying on

16

intrastate crowdfunding, which is a very new and

17

developing thing over the course of the last year.

18

we'll get an update from Sebastian this afternoon on what

19

commenters have been saying about the proposal.

20
21
22

And

Crowdfunding, something close to my heart.
Federal crowdfunding is another significant development.
The Commission recently adopted rules that will allow

23

for the first time interstate securities-based

24

crowdfunding transactions.

25

May 16th, and we'll be hearing more this afternoon about

New rules go into effect on

Page 34
1

what's happening as companies and intermediaries prepare

2

to use these new rules.

3

Another JOBS Act-driven exemption is the many-

4

IPO exemption of Regulation A.

5

popular nickname for this thing, but anyway, it's an

6

exemption that existed for many decades and in recent

7

decades not very much used.

8

amendments that went into effect in June 2015 due to the

9

SEC implementation of Title IV of the JOBS Act, companies

Regulation A+ also a very

10

can now raise up to $50 million in a 12-month period if

11

they go through a scaled SEC review process.

hear more about Regulation A and the utilization of all

13

of these exemptions both this morning and later this

14

afternoon.

15

MR. GRAHAM:

Thank you, Sara.

And we'll

I would just add

16

that improved liquidity continues to be an imperative.

17

think that's one of the things that we all want to spend

18

some time focusing on.

19

much the long and short of it.

20

has already been mentioned, that in terms of market

21

structure to facilitate liquidity, one size certainly

22

does not fit all.

23

flexible enough to accommodate innovation and growth, yet

24

strict enough to protect investors.

25

topic that the committee has addressed in the past and

I

Because for me, that's pretty
And it is clear, as it

Smaller companies need a regime

And this is another

Page 35
1

certainly one that we will continue to be interested in.

2

There are just -- these are just some of the

3

concepts that make up a landscape the committee will be

4

delving into this year as we seek to help to insure that

5

the views of small business owners, investors and other

6

stakeholders in this community are clearly heard by the

7

Commission.

8

Okay.

9

Scott Bauguess.

We are pleased to have with us today
Did I get that close enough?

2

So, Scott, thank you very much for joining us.

3

DR. BAUGUESS:

Thanks for that kind

4

introduction.

5

as an engineer, it's somewhat of an accident that I ended

6

up in finance and also ended up at the SEC.

7

would have predicted this, but here I am eight years

8

later, and it's been a wonderful ride being involved in

9

initiatives like this.

10

I was going to mention that my background

I never

Before we get started, just remind me the

11

format is -- are we going to wait for Q&A at the end or

12

can people interrupt?

13

MR. GOMEZ:

14

DR. BAUGUESS:

Completely up to you, Scott.
Okay.

So if somebody wants to

15

interrupt and ask a question, just push your microphone,

16

and I'll pause and we can go from there.

17

So the disclaimer is already given.

What I

18

thought I'd do is just give a quick background of DERA

19

just to let you know what our division does.

20

time we've been involved in the economic analysis, impact

21

analysis for rules and regulations.

22

litigation at the Commission.

23

time, too.

A recent innovation of our division is risk

24

assessment.

We're taking the same economic skillsets

25

that we use in litigation and rulemaking and applying it

For a long

We also support

We've done that for a long

Page 37
1

to help Enforcement know, see, detect misconduct in

2

markets and also to continue monitoring markets after

3

rules have been implemented.

4

see here in the data that we're going to present.

5

And some of that you will

And to start, before I get into the background

6

of some of the data that we're going to show today, I

7

just want to quickly highlight that all of this work is

8

not to my own.

9

collectively probably know more about the economics of

It's of three brilliant economists that

10

the JOBS Act than anybody else in the world:

11

Gullapalli, Vladamir Ivanov and Anzhela Knyazeva.

12

put next to them the rules that they are particular

13

experts in, and they not only helped develop the economic

14

analysis in these rulemakings and releases, but they also

15

continue to monitor the development of the markets and

16

how they're evolving.

Rachita
And I

17

And to give a little bit of an outline of what

18

I plan to do or hope to do -- and I'm sorry for those on

19

the east side of the room if you're challenged and not

20

being able to see the slides.

21

background of the landscape of the level of capital

22

raising and where the capital raising is occurring, I

23

think this is going to complement some of the other

24

materials you're going to see following this.

25

But as to give some

And then it gives some general economic

Page 38
1

perspective about how we thought of the rulemakings and

2

the JOBS actually makings as they unraveled and share

3

with you some or the predictions that we made as part of

4

these rulemakings in terms of the likelihood of these

5

markets working.

6

about how well the rules will manifest and the actual

7

practice of raising capital and then speak to some of the

8

nuance of how we think about capital raising in terms of

9

generating new capital versus just reallocating how

10

In many cases, there's big questions

capital is raised in markets.

11

And I'll run through very quickly each of the

12

rulemakings listed there.

13

that we have now produce three white papers on capital

14

raising, and each time we provide new information on how

15

private and public capital markets worked.

16

forms and filings -- or Form D became machine readable,

17

and it was shortly thereafter that we really learned,

18

maybe for the first time, how big private offering market

19

was.

Okay.

So I'll also mention

2008 was when

20

We realized it was a trillion dollar market in

21

advance of then until the forms of machinery -- couldn't

22

aggregate the data, and now we can.

23

years we've been putting out reports of the development.

24
25

And for several

So you can see right here this is a chart that
encapsulates that level of capital raising and dollar

terms.

2

dollars, which is a very big number.

3

out the first two sets of columns, the time series of

4

registered offerings, debt and equity.

5

So the 1,000 right there refers to a trillion
And we've broken

And you can see that the registered debt market

6

is far larger than the public equity market, and I think

7

that makes sense just because debt tends to be refinanced

8

and rolled over.

when we did our first study and each year since is the

But you can see that Reg D, which is

And the past couple years in particular it is

16

larger when combined with other private offering

17

exemptions than public capital raising.

18

important point that private capital raising, private

19

markets are very robust.

20

on there, and thinking about the JOBS Act, the JOBS Act

21

rules is that interstitial set of capital raising that

22

occurs between private offerings and public offerings and

23

so how they will actually work in practice, what would

24

keep -- what would get a Reg D issuer to use Reg A or not

25

to be a reporting company is what we spent a lot of time

And this is an

There's a lot of activity going

Page 40
1

thinking about.

2

If you look at the number of issuers during the

3

most recently completed calendar years, you can see that

4

there were 1,427.

5

reporting companies that raised capital either through

6

SEOs or IPOs.

7

15,632 non-fund issuers.

8

companies, finance companies, finance service companies,

9

anybody that was not a fund.

That should just be public issuers,

Regulation D, there were over 1,560 -So this could be operating

So there's a lot more

10

entities raising capital in private markets than public

11

markets.

12

And the fund, the pooled investment funds,

13

hedge funds was another 16,000 issuers.

14

which is predominately fixed income ABS type issuers,

15

these are 4(a)(2) offers that are resold to qualified

16

institutional buyers, and there were 1,418 of those.

17

then other private offerings and -- this is a little bit

18

of a latent variable because we can't always observe

19

private offerings if we don't have a source to collect

20

that information.

21

measured.

22

Rule 144(a),

And

We had 268, at least that we've

You probably have all seen this and known this,

23

but it's nevertheless interesting to look at again, and

24

that is if we break out the composition of public issuers

25

in terms of their reporting status -- and here we show

Page 41
1

them as large, accelerated filers, greater than $700

2

million in market float, non-accelerated filers that are

3

below $75 million in market float and accelerated filers

4

in between smaller reporting companies, the SRCs that

5

were previously described here, too, you can see that the

6

composition of reporting companies is predominately non-

7

accelerated filers and SRCs.

8

but they make up less than 1 percent of the market

9

capitalization as far as we can measure whereas the

10

That's a very large number,

large, accelerated filers make up 95 percent.

11

And what we've seen over the past decade,

12

particularly since Sarbanes-Oxley, is that the number of

13

public issuers has dropped from over 12,000 to less than

14

8,000.

15

so there's fewer companies that are getting bigger.

16

from an economic perspective that makes sense because the

17

fixed cost of being public has gone up.

18

sense to be bigger.

19

to be the case.

20

But the size of the public market is increasing,
And

So it makes

So that is something that continues

We continue to see a number -- a decrease in

21

the number of public companies, but they're getting

22

bigger.

23

the IPO taskforce looked at some of these issues that

24

generated rules and provisions that were promulgated in

25

the JOBS Act.

And that's also the -- one of the reasons why

Page 42
1

This was already mentioned, and I'll just

2

highlight again in the rulemakings that we did, we

3

thought carefully about small businesses and what was

4

their role in capital raising, particularly in the

5

crowdfunding release and trying to understand where

6

entrepreneurs and business startups get their capital and

7

typically it's with friends and families and

8

nonconventional sources.

9

access more conventional sources?

And how will they be able to
This was at the center

10

of many of the discussions that we had in our economic

11

analyses.

12

As I previewed in the outline slide and just to

13

give you an idea of how economists think about capital

14

raising -- and you would see this in the broad economic

15

considerations and the introduction of any economic

16

analysis that we have in our rules -- in terms of capital

17

raising, we try to separate two unique concepts.

18

that is if we're going to change a rule or an exemption

19

or an offering method, it could either cannibalize

20

existing offering methods, or it could generate a new

21

source of capital for issuers that previously could not

22

access capital.

23

And

And it's not always easy to understand or

24

measure the difference between the two, and both have

25

merits.

So if Reg A cannibalizes the Reg D market in

Page 43
1

terms of issuers simply switching over, that's a

2

manifestation of a more efficient method of raising

3

capital.

4

weren't previously able to raise capital in private

5

offering markets or using Reg D or big enough or have the

6

resources to become a reporting company, then we would

7

consider that a new source of capital.

8

But if Reg A were to attract issuers that

I think that was probably the intent of the

9

drafters of the JOBS Act was to create new capital, but

10

both of these are things that we consider carefully and

11

think are a benefit to the broader economy.

12

Okay.

So what I'm going to do here is talk

13

about each of the provisions in chronological order for

14

which they were implemented or became effective.

15

I'll give you some views in terms of how we thought about

16

these provisions and what we've observed.

17

is our own observations that we've made from our

18

analysis.

19

reports that have been made publicly since -- over the

20

past few years.

And

Some of this

Some of it's from the academic literature

21

And starting EGCs -- and I'm going to just do a

22

quick disclaimer and ask my CorpFin colleagues to correct

23

any mistakes that I make when talking about legal

24

requirements of rules and to the extent that I get it

25

wrong, but EGCs was -- I don't know if it was self-

Page 44
1

executing or occurred immediately with the enactment of

2

the statute, but no rulemaking here.

3

introduction of Title I, what we saw is a large number of

4

emerging growth companies, companies with less than a

5

billion dollars in revenue, going public.

6

percent of all reporting companies today, 928 EGCs and

7

about 85 percent of all IPOs since have an emerging

8

growth company status.

9

But after the

It's about 12

I don't actually have it on the slide here, but

10

one of -- what's interesting is the literature today has

11

somewhat -- academic literature today is somewhat mixed

12

on the views of EGCs in terms of what that has done.

13

direct -- there's some evidence that direct costs have

14

gone up to going public and also the indirect cost.

15

underpricing of IPOs with EGC status compared to

16

beforehand has gone up.

17

The

So

And underpricing is the difference between the

18

final day offering price and what the shares were sold to

19

prior to going public.

20

percent on average, and what it shows that EGCs, it's

21

higher.

22

where because the provisions allow less disclosure or

23

perhaps fewer years of audited financials, investors may

24

price that as riskier and therefore have more

25

underpricing.

Historically it's been about 15

That could reflect increasing -- information

It could also reflect -- and there's

Page 45
1

evidence of this -- that a new type of company is going

2

public that wasn't previously going public, which would

3

be consistent with the intent of the EGC status.

4

So for sure what we see if there's a difference

5

in pre- versus post-JOBS Act IPOs and those are the two

6

general considerations that are being debated upon in the

7

academic literature right now.

8

Let's see.

9

MS. MOTT:

Scott, can I ask you a question?

10

Again -- could you repeat that again?

11

noticed a pre-IPO price, so versus the actual price a

12

difference?

13

You said you

Is that what you're saying?

DR. BAUGUESS:

Yeah, so underpricing is

14

typically the difference between the closing price of the

15

first day of trading and the share -- the price when the

16

shares were sold to the initial set of investors.

17
18
19

MS. MOTT:

So you think they were -- you're

saying your data shows they were underpriced?
DR. BAUGUESS:

So all data for the past 30

20

years show that offerings are underpriced, and the

21

academic literature, not our research, but several papers

22

have now shown that underpricing has increased, which

23

means that the difference between the final day price and

24

the initial offering price --

25

MS. MOTT:

Okay.

Page 46
1

DR. BAUGUESS: -- has gotten bigger.

And the

2

interpretation is that either is that they're risker,

3

either because of the provisions of the EGC that are now

4

available or because of the difference in the types of

5

companies that are going public.

6

distinguish between the two.

7

there is a difference now.

8
9
10

MS. MOTT:
understood it.

Okay.

So it's really hard to

But for sure we know that

I just wanted to make sure I

Thank you very much.

DR. BAUGUESS:

General solicitation for those

11

here at the Commission that worked on this, it was a very

12

interesting time because depending on whose view you were

13

listening to, it was either going to destroy private

14

capital markets and fraud and misconduct was going to

15

promulgate at unprecedented rates to the view that this

16

was the panacea for all investors or issuers that didn't

17

have access to capital.

18

And in a nutshell, 506(c), and I'll show you

19

some data, really hasn't been either of those things.

20

It's been taken up at a very slow pace.

21

increased incidents in fraud, at least discernably or

22

measureable from our activities internal here.

23

haven't seen that issuers are availing themselves to the

24

ability to advertise and the removal of the ban on

25

general solicitation.

We haven't seen

And we

Page 47
1

If you look at our release that we -- the

2

economic analysis of the adopting release, we made a

3

number of predictions or claims.

4

intended to facilitate capital formation, particularly

5

for early-stage firms.

6

lower the search cost of finding accredited investors and

7

also provide accredited investors with increased

8

investment opportunities because they would be able to

9

find investments more easily.

10

We noted that it was

And we thought that it would

At least that the was the intent, and then if

11

that were true, that would decrease the overall capital -

12

- cost of capital raising and could potentially replace

13

other offering methods.

14

prediction.

15

as to whether 506 offering could be completed, and

16

there's always the issue of release of information that

17

may spoil the Reg D exemption and so there was a thought

18

that this would actually help that issue.

19

So that was the major

We thought it might also reduce uncertainty

And of course, the worry about the increased

20

incident of fraud and economic terms broadly, the concern

21

that that would erode investor participation in private

22

offering markets.

23

effect on the good issuers because of an increased number

24

of bad issuers in that market.

25

predictions.

So that would be a negative spillover

So those were the

Page 48
1

As I said, we haven't seen an increase in the

2

incidence of fraud.

3

taskforce and also a 506 working group that's headed by

4

corporate finance and also works the office of market

5

intelligence and enforcement.

6

attention paid to tips complaints and referrals that come

7

in.

8

seen the widespread fraud that was at one time a concern

9

of some constituents.

We have an internal JOBS Act

So there's special

And over time, as these groups have met, we have not

10

And at the same time, there hasn't been an

11

uptick.

12

activity that we thought.

13

Yeah.

14

MR. REARDON:

506(c) has not shown nearly the amount of

I'd like to offer some anecdotal

15

observations, and the first one is that large placement

16

agents have -- such as Wall Street firms or even regional

17

firms, have preexisting relationships with hundreds and

18

hundreds of investors.

19

placements where the offers and sales have been made to

20

hundreds of investors in private placements before 506(c)

21

was ever thought of.

22

And I've been involved in private

My clients who are smaller clients since the

23

enactment of 506(c) who are not using placement agents,

24

but are rather going to investors and speaking to them,

25

when I sit down with them and tell them that, well,

Page 49
1

you've got to tax returns or get a letter from an

2

accountant.

3

that's -- I'm never going to get anybody to invest if I

4

start prying in their personal life like that, and it's

5

just not going to work.

6

so let's just do it the regular way.

They immediately push back and say, oh,

And I'm not interested in that,

7

Now it's anecdotal, it's not statistical, but

8

it might be that the small fry for who I think this was

9

really intended are just scared to go out there and say

10

to these potential investors, well, I need to see your

11

financial statements or get a letter from your

12

accountant.

13

and I'll go somewhere else.

14

worth, you might consider that.

15

And the reaction is, well, my money's green

DR. BAUGUESS:

And so, for whatever that's

I think that's a good

16

observation and also my colleagues in the Division of

17

Corporation Finance have much closer pulse to the views

18

that have come in on issues like that.

19

they have any comments on that.

20

MR. GOMEZ:

I don't know if

We've heard that, Patrick, that --

21

I think it's a concern that some have expressed.

22

heard others' concerns as well.

23

heard a lot of concerns with respect to the safe harbor

24

verification at first, and then as time has progressed

25

with respect to some participants a little bit more of a

We've

Anecdotally also, we've

Page 50
1

willingness to move to the principles-based approach of

2

verification that doesn't necessarily require the issuer

3

to go and ask for specific tax information.

4

like it's an area that is still growing and developing.

5

And it may be that people are slowly getting more

6

comfortable with the principles-based approach and be

7

more willing to move away from the safe harbor.

8

yours, anecdotal evidence that we've heard from meetings

9

with people.

10

MR. YADLEY:

So it seems

But like

I agree with that comment.

I

11

think another element is still some concern particularly

12

among lawyers and other professionals, but also among

13

smaller issuers of not knowing who the people are.

14

mean it's a great idea to be able to get investors from

15

anywhere, but then you think about these are going to be

16

equity holders in your little business, and there's just

17

a little bit of a fear factor there as well.

18

MR. NELSON:

Can you double-click and expand on

19

the principles-based approach?

20

MR. GOMEZ:

21

I

What is principled?

I'm going to move the chair.

That

way I don't have to squat.

22

So when the rules were proposed, the Commission

23

initially proposed for taking reasonable steps to verify,

24

there would be a principles-based approach in which the

25

issuer would consider the information it has about the

Page 51
1

investor and make a determination as to whether the

2

investor is accredited or not.

3

process, the Commission has received a lot of comments

4

from market participants and other observers who

5

indicated that they would prefer to have a safe harbor

6

for the taking the reasonable steps to verify.

7

adopting release, the Commission, in response to those

8

comments, created two different ways of taking reasonable

9

steps to verify.

10

During the comment

So in the

On the one hand the concept of a principles-

11

based approach, when the issuer looks at the information

12

it has, it makes a determination it's one of the options.

13

In addition to that, the Commission also added safe

14

harbors.

15

Commission has to, in many ways, think about all of the

16

potential different situations.

17

harbor could have additional requirements that you may

18

not have to go through if you're going through the

19

principles-based approach.

Now when you think of safe harbors, the

20

MR. NELSON:

21

MS. TIERNEY:

So in many ways the safe

Thank you.
I was just going to add that as

22

second market, we had a business after 506(c) was adopted

23

for about two years where we actually did verification as

24

a broker-dealer for a number of companies that were

25

utilizing it to raise capital.

And I think what our

Page 52
1

experience showed was that, like Sebastian said at the

2

beginning, the companies and the law firms that we were

3

working with were very, very, very focused on the safe

4

harbor and following the rules.

5

number of issuers over two years.

6

And we worked with a

I think the most interesting trends that we

7

started seeing towards the end -- we don't do this

8

business anymore, but towards the end where we really

9

were seeing a significant number of letters coming from

10

CPAs and law firms, which we thought was surprising.

11

People really are not comfortable giving their personal

12

financial information, even to registered broker-dealers,

13

and we were surprised to see so many accountants step up

14

and give certifications on behalf of their clients.

15

CHAIR WHITE:

Scott, may I -- I think, but

16

correct me if I'm wrong.

17

have on this.

18

uptick issue, not an increase in the number of 506(c)s,

19

but the amounts, the dollar amounts?

20

have you observed that or --

21

I don't know how much data we

But have we recently seen, in terms of the

DR. BAUGUESS:

I mean is that --

I don't know offhand.

I don't

22

have the data here on whether the amounts have gone up.

23

I do have a slide in terms of showing that it's been a

24

steady state number of issuants over three years.

25

I'm sure that the crack staff sitting over in those seats

But

Page 53
1

is going to be able to answer that question in short

2

order.

3

(Comment off-mic.)

4

DR. BAUGUESS:

5
6

about it.

That's right.

So let's see here.

They're thinking

My clicker is now defunct.

So maybe you can -- there we go.

So on the point of the

7

uptick of 506(c), one of the observations that I think is

8

consistent with some of the reservations of doing it is

9

that we see that the uptick is mostly with operating

10

companies and not funds.

11

probably if they have to advertise the offering are

12

signaling that maybe their offering isn't as good as

13

those that don't have to advertise and there's some

14

reticence to do so.

15

businesses or companies, that is where we have seen the

16

uptick the most.

17

in just a second.

18

And the many hedge funds,

But for operating companies or small

And I'll show you some figures on that

But before we -- working again?

Okay, great.

19

Let's see here.

20

intermediation costs -- so we see is that those who use

21

506(c), we thought -- at least we predicted in the rule

22

that if you could advertise you wouldn't need to use an

23

intermediary because you don't need to have somebody find

24

you investors anymore.

25

But in terms of the use of 506(c), the

What we actually see is that that those who do

Page 54
1

do 506(c) are more likely to have an intermediary, and

2

those intermediation costs, basically what they report on

3

Form D, are higher.

4

inconsistent with what we predicted, but also consistent

5

with of those who are using, they're probably new types

6

of issuers.

7

So this was something that was

And these are operating companies that

8

previously may not have issued it, and now they're

9

foraying into that market, and they're using a placement

10

agent or somebody to help them and they're advertising in

11

order to increase investor awareness of that offering.

12

And also I should say the median offer is larger, but the

13

amount raised is lower.

14

in uncertainty and higher risk in some of those

15

offerings.

16

So there's probably an increase

This is a very busy chart, and it may be best

17

to consume after the fact.

18

pieces of information here.

19

there are four columns.

20

offerings, initial offerings, not amended offerings, so

21

new initiated offerings that are captured on Form D.

22

Since the enactment of 506(c) or the effectiveness of it

23

on September 23, 2013 through the end of the last

24

calendar year, there have been 48, almost 50,000

25

offerings and -- reported having sold $1.5 trillion.

But there are a couple of key
And the first is -- and

And the first column is all 506

And

Page 55
1

most of that is in the 506(b).

2

506(b), and only -- if you look at 506(c), only 23 and 26

3

billion were raised for funds and not funds.

4

see the overall level of capital is -- raised is much

5

lower.

6

So 1.17 trillion is in

So you can

If you look at the difference between the

7

average investors in an offer, 506(c) offerings for non-

8

funds operating companies are only eight investors versus

9

twelve for the classical 506(b), so they're a smaller

10
11

number of investors.

The offering size is also smaller.

The median offer size is only a half million dollars

12

versus a million.

13

median size of a Reg D offer is a million dollars.

14

it's over a trillion dollar market, which means that the

15

vast majority of offerings are tiny.

16

And it's interesting to note that the
Yet

And it also helps provide context to other

17

offering exemptions and state law registration preemption

18

in particular that many of the smaller offerings that

19

could avail themselves of other exemptions historically

20

have used Reg D in the GAO report and others have

21

acknowledged that's likely because of the preemption

22

ability of the Reg D 506 offering.

23

MS. HANKS:

24

DR. BAUGUESS:

25

MS. HANKS:

Scott.
Yeah.

I have a comment or observation on

Page 56
1

the number of investors issue because I think what we see

2

in the 506(c) field, because you are able to use a

3

special purpose vehicle, I think a number of the

4

offerings do.

5

that the low number of investors that you're seeing there

6

very frequently includes one fund that has one fund that

7

has 99 investors.

8

and drill down on that, or we're just stuck with what's

9

on Form D?

10

So my guess -- and it's just a guess -- is

Any way to get more information there

DR. BAUGUESS:

Well, I hate to say stuck what's

11

on Form D, because Form D even as written is brilliant.

12

It gives us an insight into a market we don't have.

13

There is also a pending proposal to amend Form D to

14

collect other additional information that would help us

15

understand better how that market's working.

16

certain flaws with the way it currently works in -- not

17

flaws, but inability to observe everything.

18

those caveats are highlighted in some of the work that

19

we've produced.

20

currently exists.

21

There are

So when you go out there and you compare the cost

You have to access a

From a cost-benefit perspective, unless you are
planning to go through that route and you're making an

10

investment in that area, it's probably not something you

11

would really consider unless you really had a plan to

12

expand your business and continually go out for

13

additional funds that way.

14

got to be tremendous, loan for a million versus going

15

through this route.

16

DR. BAUGUESS:

So the cost differential has

Yeah, that's an excellent point,

17

and it speaks to the broader issue.

18

IPO on-ramp was to create stages by which you could raise

19

capital to ultimately go public, and that's a very astute

20

observation.

21

The whole idea of an

This slide Chair White was asking about doesn't

22

answer her question, but it does show that this is year-

23

over-year changes and the starting date is September

24

because that's when it was enacted.

25

vertical bars represent the number of monthly offerings,

And you can see the

Page 58
1

and the lines represent the cumulative number of

2

offerings which is on the right scale.

And it's almost

3

scary how consistent this is over time.

Going to the

4

third year, there is zero deviation in the rate at which

5

506(c) is being used.

6

predicted that it would be such a steady state exemption

7

in terms of issues availing themselves to it.

I don't think anybody would have

8

MR. HAUPTMAN:

Scott, could I ask a question?

9

DR. BAUGUESS:

Sure.

10

MR. HAUPTMAN:

Sorry.

I'm a little late to

11

this I suppose.

12

investors and the companies that want their funding, how

13

much was this benchmarked for best practices against

14

other countries, like how does Singapore do this, how

15

does Hong Kong do this to make sure we're doing it the

16

best way?

17

looked at in this whole process?

18

But could ask all of this on small

How much was looked at -- other countries were

DR. BAUGUESS:

That's a great question because

19

whenever we enact a new rule or regulations, you have

20

this issue of you don't have a counterfactual to what the

21

world would look like with that rule in place.

22

the only way we can do that is by looking at other

23

markets to see what they've done, to look at disconnects

24

and their changes of rules to see what happened to those

25

markets.

And often

Unfortunately, even though our data is limited,

Page 59
1

it tends to be much better than what you can get in

2

international markets.

3

only have anecdotal evidence to speak on issues like

4

that.

5

So we're often very limited and

But as a point, maybe an exception to that is

6

equity-based crowdfunding which has promulgated

7

international markets probably in advance more so than

8

here, and our rules were informed on those practices.

9

And I think that even some of the -- that you might see

10
11

later today is going to be drawn from that pool.
Okay.

So I'm going to speed up a little bit

12

here and just make -- give you some major takeaways from

13

the Reg A rulemaking.

14

sit at the intersection of private and public capital

15

raising and why would an issuer that would use the Reg D

16

market, why would they avail themselves to Reg A and not

17

do a public offering or why would somebody who's

18

considered a public or registered offering avail

19

themselves to Reg A or the modified Reg A.

20

And this is one that really does

And so a lot of the questions that we had --

21

and this is now -- we have six months' worth of data --

22

were centered on those issues.

23

point out a couple of things that we said in the economic

24

analysis that we wanted to watch for and in terms of the

25

potential use of Reg A.

And I'm just going to

And there's tier one and tier

Page 60
1

two offerings.

2

registration at or up to 50 million.

3

20 million, and you have to register with the states

4

securities authorities, but there are no ongoing

5

disclosure requirements and different initial disclosure

6

requirements, too, and I hope I didn't say any of that

7

wrong, Sebastian.

8
9

Tier two are exempt from state securities
Tier one is up to

But one of the things that we asked early on is
why would you choose between the two, and it really is a

10

tradeoff between the cost of qualification and ongoing

11

disclosure requirements and the benefit of having access

12

to a broad investor base and the preemption of those

13

state securities, the registration process and the

14

tradeoff between whether or not going general

15

solicitation to accredited investors was better than

16

going to retail investors and not having resell

17

restrictions.

18

And all of that then hinges on liquidity, which

19

somebody has mentioned earlier, of these securities of

20

how you're going to exit this market.

21

secondary market that trades this, these securities?

22

these Reg A issuers going to try to list on the big board

23

or go national market exchange?

24

12(b) registration requirements which then has more

25

onerous disclosure requirements.

Will there be a
Are

If so, then they trigger

So the big outstanding

Page 61
1

question from an economic perspective is will there be an

2

ability to get liquidity for these securities in such a

3

way that it would provide a benefit over a private

4

offering and also benefit over registering your

5

securities and becoming -- with the SEC and becoming a

6

reporting company, Exchange Act reporting company.

7

The data that we have today is somewhat

8

limited, but what we see is that total capital sought is

9

about 1.3 billion of qualified followings.

That

10

corresponds to 290 million.

11

between tier one and tier two offerings roughly speaking.

12

There's an even split

And the median sought for tier one offerings is 13

13

million versus a tier two at 24 million and those that

14

qualified -- or qualified filings, those are seven and a

15

half and 23 million respectively.

16

If you look at who is availing themselves to

17

Regulation A, they're mostly pre-revenue firms, so these

18

are the typical startup idea generating firms, not the

19

revenue generating firms.

20

variation amongst the characteristics:

21

amount sought, industry location and profitability.

22

Median assets is very low, so you can see that there's

23

not a lot of dollar value of assets.

24

percent of the filings had -- issuers had less than a

25

million dollars in assets and 95 percent had less than a

Now there's quite a bit of
issuer size,

And I think 72

Page 62
1

hundred million.

2

And let's see here.

There we go.

And some other observations, 90

3

percent of these are best effort offerings.

4

typical firm commitment offering like you'd see with an

5

IPO.

6

which the intermediation definitely has a different

7

flavor to it than you would an IPO company.

8

them are equity offerings.

9

percent, are equity offerings.

10
11

There's no

So you can see that these are higher risk firms in

And most of

The vast majority, about 80
Half of the filings are

in business services, real estate and credit industries.
I don't know that we had any preconceived notion what

12

that would look like, but at least historically

13

Regulation A had been a way to raise capital in the

14

finance sector and banks in particular.

15

Yeah, question.

16

MS. MOTT:

17

20

50 percent

were -- what other industries did you see represented?

18
19

What was the other half?

DR. BAUGUESS:

Maybe my colleagues in CorpFin

know.
MR. GOMEZ:

Catherine, we've seen pretty much

21

every of the industry groups in the SEC that reviewed

22

these filings have actually touched one Reg A offering.

23

So other than that 50 percent that Scott mentions there,

24

the rest of it has very dramatically --

25

MS. MOTT:

So it's just varied.

Page 63
1

MR. GOMEZ:

2

MS. MOTT:

Yeah.
So when I was looking at this and

3

thinking about it, I mean -- and the reason I'm -- I

4

guess I should say in full disclosure one of my portfolio

5

companies is evaluating Reg A+ as an option.

6

think about the number of companies, it's in the

7

healthcare, med tech.

8

of healthcare, med tech, maybe clean tech, some of the

9

things that are more capital-intensive in that.

And when I

So I fully expected to see a lot

So I'm a

10

little surprised that business services is in there.

11

just wanted to try to understand.

12

MS. HANKS:

So

Thank you.

Actually, if I could add something

13

on the nature of the filers, since I represent 10 percent

14

of the companies who actually did the filing, many of the

15

new companies are in what comes under the SEC filing

16

categories of computer services.

17

we found in doing those filings, all of the options for

18

industry type, you've got like left-handed widgets and

19

right-handed widgets and big widgets and little widgets,

20

and then a whole bunch of companies fall within one

21

bucket, which the closest thing that we can find is

22

computer services or in some cases entertainment.

And one of the things

23

So that I think is going to limit your ability

24

to measure who's going through because we -- yeah, we're

25

all computer services in one way or the other because we

Page 64
1

all use computers.

2

think of.

That was the best thing we could

3

DR. BAUGUESS:

4

MR. NELSON:

5

That's better than other.
And I just wanted to double-check.

This is a total of 67 registrations and only three

6

actually did the Reg A IPO.

7

the data that I saw in the previously slide?

Is that correct?

8

MR. GOMEZ:

9

filings in the previous slide.

Is that

So yes, so there were 68 Reg A
Keep in mind that the Reg

10

A filing, once they file with the SEC, they go through a

11

review process.

12

one, also they go through a review process at the state

13

level.

14

the company can still decide the timing as to when they

15

want to qualify the offering.

16

And to the extent they're doing a tier

And then once the review process is clear, then

So the previous slide noted that while there

17

had been 68 companies that initiated the process, three

18

of them have actually completed the process itself and

19

their offerings qualify, which means that they can

20

actually start selling.

21

MR. REARDON:

If I can make a point, Laura,

22

your question about why you wouldn't go to a bank and get

23

this money is that under the industry comment there,

24

business services, real estate and credit industries.

25

Most of those companies are not going to be able to --

Page 65
1

like business services, if they're like law firms they

2

don't have any marketable assets though than a bunch of

3

used desks that really have a tremendous discount.

4

Real estate traditionally is a combination of

5

invested equity and borrowed money and credit industries

6

is the same.

7

get your minimum amount of equity, then you go borrow the

8

rest.

9

would hazard a guess that most of those companies are

Most of -- you first get the equity, you

And you have to have that kind of blend.

So I

10

looking as the next step to go to a bank, and they may

11

even have a bank commitment letter.

12

we'll lend you Y.

13

MS. YAMANAKA:

If X is raised,

Yeah, I think you're probably

14

looking for -- this is just anecdotal based on the client

15

base that I see in service and the people that I speak

16

to.

18

they're building up.

they're figuring out, oh, they can make some money at

this in order to expand.

24
25

Usually at that point in time, it's friends and
They have some sort of equity base first that
The next step then is a traditional

They're going out with a lot less amount.

How can we do it?

Then

A million

And so I think perhaps a different industry -because even we've got services firms.

We actually

Page 66
1

particularly do attorneys, and a million dollars is

2

nothing for attorneys.

3

practices, you know a million doesn't go very far.

4

think this point really illustrates it varies

5

tremendously by industry.

6

For all of you who extensive
So I

And to the point, Sara, that you made, that's

7

so true.

8

services all get kind of lumped into that computer

10

that -- Catherine, that you see or I see when I would

11

classify the types of industries.

And one clarification, I misspoke

when I gave you the data.

process, and three of them actually have completed the

16

sale or the transaction that they were doing, and they

17

have reported that to us to indicate that they have

18

completed the sale of the securities.

19

Sixty-eight companies have

Seventeen of them have completed the

MR. NELSON:

Is the -- any information on which

20

three companies actually did that?

21

them.

22
23
24
25

I'd love to talk to

Is that publicly available?
MR. GOMEZ:

It's publicly available.

I can

talk to you afterwards as to how you get to that data.
MS. TIERNEY:

Just if it may be interesting, we

did a kind of deep dive into the Reg A+ space once the

Page 67
1

rules became effective to see whether there was an

2

opportunity for NASDAQ private market to work with

3

companies, especially in the tier two space.

4

into the analysis with some assumptions.

5

like, sort of that it would be med tech, healthcare,

6

companies that had to constantly raise capital and

7

probably would want to look at a different way of doing

8

that.

And we went

Catherine,

9

So we talked to 14 different investment banking

10

kind of companies, tier two, tier three investment banks,

11

and their take on it was that their investors' primary

12

focus is always liquidity.

13

provide any liquidity in the -- even the tier two space

14

because the resales are not preempt under state law kind

15

of makes that a no-go for most of the banks to take their

16

clients in that direction.

17

And so the inability to

The other thing is they didn't see a real

18

savings between a tier two 8A and an IPO using the onramp

19

process.

20

kind of better accommodations.

21

cost savings there.

22

were hearing was to the extent that a company did choose

23

to a tier two with an 8A and they qualified to come to

24

the market, they would do that.

25

NASDAQ or they would go to the New York Stock Exchange,

And IPO onramp provided more flexibility and
So they didn't see a real

And then I think the other thing we

They would come to

Page 68
1

but it was really the absolute opposite of what we

2

expected to hear which was very interesting to us.

3

DR. BAUGUESS:

Those are great observations,

4

and in particular the idea of raising equity to lever up

5

to get capital in different ways is a little bit

6

different than going public to get liquidity for your

7

shareholders to cash out or list.

8

captured that in our economic analysis, at least to the -

9

- that wasn't among our predictions.

10
11

And I don't think we

observations are really nice to have.
MR. YADLEY:

So all these
Thanks.

One of our clients availed itself

12

of the new Reg A process.

13

weren't ready to do an IPO, but they wanted to get some

14

visibility, wanted to start the discipline.

15

things that I think we hoped would happen with this did

16

use an intermediary.

17

the SEC, but ultimately they were unable to raise the

18

funds, so they withdrew.

19

for where it mattered I guess, but the money was --

20

doesn't have anything to do with the rules per se, but we

21

did a great job.

22

MS. HANKS:

23

MR. YADLEY:

And their thinking was they

Some of the

The process was very smooth with

So positive experience except

Only a lawyer would say that.
But I think it does reflect sort

24

of what Annemarie was saying is who are the investors and

25

everybody wants everything, but what are they actually

Page 69
1

going to invest in, and particularly where they don't

2

know somebody and they don't know the company.

3

good, but you're still sort of gambling with an early-

4

stage company.

5

DR. BAUGUESS:

It sounds

I'm going to finish very quickly

6

there and just make a couple observations about

7

crowdfunding, particularly since it's not yet effective.

8
9

But just say from an economic perspective what we -when we first started with respect to securities

10

issuances, it was somewhat of a puzzle because it seemed

11

to an economist that you had uninformed -- with respect

12

to securities offering, an uninformed issuer trying to

13

issue securities to an uninformed investor without

14

classical intermediation.

15

that?

16

And how would you ever value

And so it was somewhat of a puzzle, and maybe

17

our second question was wisdom of the what.

18

some internal education to understand with respect to

19

investor protection.

20

about how a crowdfund issuance or issuer might enter into

21

the realm of securities issuances.

22

spent a lot of time in the economic analysis thinking

23

about how you would go from rewards-based to securities

24

issuances.

25

And it took

It really was a new way of thinking

But it was -- we

The big outstanding question is still:

How

Page 70
1

will an investor exit the security?

2

the Silicon Valley types a long time ago, we would often

3

receive answers like, well, if you just do it, they'll

4

figure it out.

5

rule on economic analysis of if you do it, it will work.

6
7
8
9

When we talked to

And you can imagine trying to write a

It didn't meet the guidance that we have set forth in
economic analysis.
But this is still something that we're very
curious to see how it will unfold.

We know there are

10

ways a solution can develop and manifest, particularly

11

with the creativity of Silicon Valley and already angel

12

groups have demonstrated an ability to do this type of

13

activity notwithstanding these rules and also state-level

14

crowdfunding, so innovation is bubbling up, and there's a

15

lot of learning going on and very curious to hear how

16

this committee thinks or what they're observing and how

17

this market will develop.

18

there and pass the torch.

19

MR. GRAHAM:

20

MS. HANKS:

And I'm going to conclude

Any additional questions?
Yeah, I just had one question,

21

Scott, on the -- one of the sources, just to take you

22

back to one of the very much earlier slides, I mean sort

23

of the other lump.

24

this whole market is that we don't have a lot of

25

visibility to the stuff that's happening that isn't doing

One thing that I always worry about

Page 71
1

-- isn't relying on Regulation D or alternatively not

2

filing Form Ds which in my prior life I did not use to do

3

because it is not compulsory.

4

I'm constantly looking at the data in tech crunch or any

5

of those guys in PitchBook.

6

looking out to see what you might be missing and

7

crosschecking that?

8

you think?

9

And so I think there is --

Is there any way that you're

How much are you not capturing do

DR. BAUGUESS:

That's a great question.

And we

10

have done in similar rulemakings, particularly the bad

11

actor release which is now a few years old, we compared

12

Form D filings to prospectuses that are filed with FINRA

13

and also ADV filings to see if there were evidence of

14

issuers that were not filing Form D.

15

have to jog my memory.

16

there was surprisingly good coverage with respect to not

17

a lot missing, at least within that universe.

18

And I'm going to

It's been a couple years, but

That doesn't mean -- I think I heard somebody

19

once tell me that a private offering isn't private if you

20

make it public through a Form D.

21

that that exists, then you're just not going to see that

22

activity, and I'll just throw it over to the CorpFin

23

colleagues in terms of the outstanding proposal on Form D

24

if they want to make any comments about how that issue

25

may or may not be addressed if we ever picked that up.

And so to the extent

Page 72
1

MS. HANKS:

I think that actually underlines my

2

thought that if it's not intermediated, you're just not

3

capturing it.

4

MR. GRAHAM:

Well, there's -- I have a number

5

of clients I'm sure that others are in the same position

6

where like you said, Scott, if it's -- how is it going to

7

be a private financing if you're filing a Reg D or a Form

8

D?

9

file because they don't need to.

And I have many clients as a result that just done
I mean the nature of

10

the transaction is such that they're perfectly

11

comfortable just relying on the statutory exemption.

And

12

there's a lot that is done in that area, as you know.

I

13

suppose you don't pick much of that up.

14

DR. BAUGUESS:

15

sources of information.

16

through third parties for a variety of reasons, and it is

17

a big, latent component of our analysis, but it is

18

something that we try to get at.

19

mandatory disclosure requirement or filing requirement,

20

there will always be this unobserved component, and we

21

just won't know what the level of compliance is with Form

22

D.

23

MR. GUTIERREZ:

We try to find other clever
A lot of this is self-reported

But unless there is a

I actually have a question on

24

that.

25

then create a feedback loop, especially with the

Sorry.

Is there an intent on behalf of the SEC to

Page 73
1

intermediaries to see what is happening out there

2

actually on the streets, so beyond just looking at the

3

sources, but actually bringing folks in and in particular

4

those -- like I'm very curious about this episode in

5

which someone kind of went through the entire process but

6

then actually wasn't able to raise any money.

7

And so trying to understand what went right,

8

what went wrong, what did they hear back from investors.

9

Because as an investor, I certainly would love to know

10

what is it that prohibited or precluded investors from

11

actually pulling the trigger on something like this and

12

whether or not that is a rules issue or is it just a

13

comfort level with the process or possibly just with the

14

types of companies that are coming back.

15

as to what kind of formal feedback loop is being created

16

in order to tweak what is out there.

So I'm curious

17

DR. BAUGUESS:

18

Business Policy gets information.

2

too.

3

MR. GOMEZ:

Xavier, I think it's going to be

4

interesting to see, especially in Reg A, because a

5

company like the one that Greg was mentioning actually

6

has made a filing with the SEC.

7

qualified, so you know that the company went all the way

8

through that process.

9

That filing actually is

Now there's nothing that requires the company

10

to tell us why didn't they actually sell.

11

lot of companies would rather not tell what was -- the

12

problem was.

13

with respect to companies that actually went through the

14

process and still did not manage to sell.

15

harder thing is going to be actually the reason why that

16

didn't happen.

17

And I'm sure a

I think we're going to get some data then

I think the

Also, just one other thing that as an SEC

18

staffer, it's almost like nails on the chalkboard when I

19

hear that the Form D is not compulsory.

20

the Form D is a requirement under the rules, and

21

therefore it is required.

22

referring to is the fact that it's not a condition to the

23

exemption, so you do not lose the exemption if you fail

24

to file.

25

The filing of

I think, Sara, what you're

But I think it's important to know for everyone

Page 75
1

here, which I'm sure you do, but also all of those -- you

2

watching on the webcast, that the filing of the Form D

3

actually is a requirement, and it does provide very

4

helpful data to understand how the markets work.

5
6

MR. GRAHAM:
Form D or Regulation D.

7
8

MR. GOMEZ:

That's correct.

And I think the

point you were making --

9
10

It's a requirement if you're using

MR. GRAHAM:

But if you're using the statutory

exemption --

11

MR. GOMEZ: -- Steve, is -- exactly.

And I

12

think a lot of the companies that get comfortable with

13

the 4(a)(2) exemption and they feel like they don't have

14

to go to the safe harbor in 506, well, at that point

15

they're not relying on the safe harbor in 506(b).

16

They're relying on 4(a)(2), and of course because they're

17

outside of Reg D, then they don't have to file the Form

18

D.

19

MR. YADLEY:

That may -- and I doubt it's a

20

primary reason why issuers would prefer to use 506(b)

21

than (c), but certainly that puts it in the light -- you

22

can't rely on the statute if you've gone out and tried to

23

do a 506(c).

24
25

MS. HANKS:

That's a really important point for

the guys watching at home is all the stuff we were saying

Page 76
1

about the filing of the Form D not being -- it's not a

2

condition, but it is a requirement.

3

be absolutely irrelevant if you are doing a generally

4

solicited 506(c) because you've got to do that.

5

Sebastian will be really mad if you don't.

6

MR. NELSON:

That's all going to

Is there any way to get additional

7

data on capital formation?

8

being on this committee, I've been thinking, holy crap,

9

this is a huge part of a GDP.

As I've been thinking about

Massive, massive amounts

10

of jobs come from these tiny little businesses.

11

feels like we're flying in the dark when it comes to how

12

they have money.

13

to get that data?

14

I don't know.

But it

Is there any other way

I mean in Silicon Valley we tend to say what we

15

measure we can improve.

16

don't really know how well we're doing on capital

17

formation from this.

18

wall asking people at Angel List, asking everyone that I

19

know how would you measure capital formation.

20

thing that I could find is could you get that data from

21

like the IRS and tax filings?

22

If we're not measuring it, we

I've been banging my head against a

The best

I have no idea what the legality of that would

23

be, but if you could actually look and say these startups

24

or these small businesses had these capital purchases or

25

this capital expense, and they had some sort of income,

Page 77
1

you could kind of infer from some of that.

2

know if that's even possible or not.

3

DR. BAUGUESS:

But I don't

So you're saying that the

4

Silicon Valley types would be for more mandatory

5

disclosure on their --

6

MR. NELSON:

I'm not -- I don't mind

7

disclosing, but that's me.

8

is not how do we disclose these stock purchases, but how

9

do we figure out how small companies get their money.

10

DR. BAUGUESS:

For me it's -- the question

It's an excellent question, and

11

we're always scouring for new sources, whether they're

12

PACE service, fee services, vendor services, data

13

aggregators, and we -- every new rulemaking that we

14

promulgate, we think carefully about what the disclosure

15

requirements are to the extent that it's within the SEC

16

purview, not only thinking about what the disclosure

17

requirements are, but how can we collect in a machine

18

readable format in a very parsimonious way so that we can

19

analyze it.

20

And so that's -- from an economist perspective,

21

that's one of the first things that we look at, and

22

that's one our contributions to the rulemaking process is

23

to say here's how this data would be usable and here's

24

what we would do it with it and help improve the

25

efficiency of that process.

But to answer your question

Page 78
1

on the IRS, information, data, it's a great idea, and I'm

2

sure some of my colleagues in DERA probably know the

3

answer to that question, but I don't.

4

MR. GRAHAM:

5

to take a quick break.

6

let's break.

Okay.

Well, we're going to have

And so thank you, Scott, and

Reconvene in 10 minutes.

(A brief recess was taken.)

8

MS. HANKS:

9

Okay.

Welcome back, everybody.

Continuing the theme of data and what we do and don't

10

have, which I think is going to be a constant theme for

11

this committee for this term, we've got two experts here

12

who can help us further unpack the information that is

13

available or not available about the scope and size of

14

the unregistered markets.

15

First we're going to hear from Jeffrey Sohl,

16

professor and director for the Center for Venture

17

Research at the University of New Hampshire.

19

angel market since 1980, and I must say it's very

20

important research that I have looked at for a lot over

21

the course of the last few years.

provide an understanding of the angel market through

quality research.

Jeff and Brian, thank you very much for joining
us today.

22

DR. SOHL:

Than you, Sara.

So what I want to

23

do is just give you a little context, and let's see if

24

this works.

25

Which one?

Where is my computer that I'm pointing to?
Thank you.

That is perfect, thank you.

Page 80

So a little bit of history.

This is back in

2

1874, so real history.

3

investing we ever heard of.

4

looking for money and of course the banks back then

5

thought the idea of a telephone was quite ridiculous as

6

you can see from The Boston Post.

7

too high tech and too advanced, and he didn't have any

8

customers.

9

This is probably the first angel
Alexander Graham Bell was

And it was obviously

Sounds quite familiar today.
Two angel investors, Gardiner Green Hubbard,

10

who was a Boston attorney, and Thomas Sanders, who was a

11

Salem leather merchant actually funded Alexander Graham

12

Bell, changed the company, put it into Bell Telephone

13

Company of Boston they called it.

14

actually thought the first use of the telephone was to

15

project concerts to people in rural areas, and Hubbard

16

and Sanders said, no, no, no, no.

17

communications device here we're going to work on.

18

Alexander Graham Bell

We've got a little

Fast forward that about a hundred years, and

Anita Roddick opened up The Body Shop, one store, 1976 in

It was an

He came into the money through an

So that's a little bit of context.
So where is this going?
investors look for.

Just to see what

And again, I'm probably boring a

10

bunch of people, but I like to look at the context

11

because a lot of entrepreneurs think differently.

12

Everybody thinks it's that surfboard.

13

technology, it's the idea.

14

one part, and in fact, it's not really that big a part.

15

It's important, and I'm sure we've all in various walks

16

of life had heard of, oh, I got this great idea.

17

It's the

And in essence, the idea is

Well, it's really that entrepreneur on top of

18

that surfboard.

19

watch out for.

20

work, how it goes to market, how it's transformed from an

21

idea to really in the market place.

22

great, and if it's a very good surfboard, but without

23

that entrepreneur, it's not moving.

24
25

It's the execution risk that you have to
It's how that is -- that idea is put to

So that surfboard is

And I think the third piece of the puzzle that
we always examine is that market niche, it's that huge

Page 82
1

wave of demand.

2

there's a lot of people that really want that paying

3

point solved.

4

not up, as anybody who does surfing knows, you're not

5

going anywhere on that board no matter how good the board

6

or you are.

7

of that market niche that's really flying along.

There's a paying point out there, and

So that's that big wave.

So if the surf's

So you really need that external influence

8

So with that in mind, the angel market and

9

actually the private equity market -- and by private

10

equity we all use various, different definitions.

11

going to just look at it in this way.

12

the angels and the venture capital.

13

colleagues at Crowdnetics, they gave me all the equity --

14

I just deal with equity crowdfunding, nothing else.

15

gave me all the equity crowdfunding data, over 6,000

16

deals since 2013.

17

accredited investors, because it's May 16, right, when

18

the other rules go in.

19

So that's good.

So I'm

The crowdfunding,
And I thank my

They

That's of course

The angel data is all ours, and the venture

20

capital data is the National Venture Capitalist

21

Association.

22

what I'm calling kind of the democratization of the

23

private equity markets.

24

of the JOBS Act and the idea of all the regs is to allow

25

the masses to now start writing checks in the startups.

So we look at the crowdfunding as really

We're trying to -- and the idea

Page 83
1

And obviously I have my own opinions.

2

source of data I'm hoping, and it will be a fun ride for

3

an academic analyzing that data.

4

of my thoughts quiet for now.

5

It will be a great

And I'll leave the rest

But so that really -- you've got the founders'

6

money, and then you've got that crowdfunding kind of

7

jumping in.

8

remember, this is 6,000 deals since '13, only accredited,

9

so it hasn't really been fully democratized if you will.

10

The numbers were are getting -- now

So here's some ideas.

11

Now be careful with that 20 percent success

12

rate.

13

put the -- something up on any of these platforms, Angel

14

List, anything like that.

15

They're not screened deals.

16

screening, whatever the intermediary does, but nobody

17

really screens it on the merit to my knowledge.

18

Those are non-vetted deals.

That's anybody can

So these are non-vetted.
There might be some minor

Now here's the ask -- and the raise, there is

19

obviously a huge disconnect here.

20

million give or take a couple hundred thousand.

21

average raise is 210,00.

22

here in those markets.

23

The average ask is 2
And the

So we are obviously not in sync

However, they are relying heavily on equity as

24

one would hope.

25

equity financing.

72 percent of those deals are in the
21 percent convertible debt.

I just

Page 84
1

hope all those people understand what convertible debt

2

is.

3

is -- my sense is that that straight debt probably has

4

some kind of equity -- warrants something.

And then about 7 percent is straight debt.

5

My idea

Now you -- I head when I was listening to the

6

previous speakers, we were talking about sectors.

7

again, these are -- and, Sara, I agree with you.

8

these sectors get bumped in, so it's really hard to

9

figure out what sectors we have.

And
Some of

And again, this isn't

10

the data that I collect, so I have to kind of -- it's not

11

-- it's not an AX code level data.

12

But the best we could tell if you lump it,

13

services is the dominant, about 40-some-odd percent in

14

the services industry.

15

of stuff.

16

that seems like a lot of the -- oh, well, computer

17

services, computer technology, yeah, we use all

18

computers, so let's put it in technology.

19

goods, which I thought would be a little bit bigger, is

20

really small.

21

Now that could be a whole bunch

And then technology is the 34 percent, and

Consumer

Healthcare, I remember the question -- I think

22

that was you, Catherine, with the healthcare.

23

about 5 percent, pretty tiny in the crowdfunding market,

24

not so in the angel market.

25

what that is to be perfectly honest.

That's

And commerce, I'm not sure
But we literally

Page 85
1

just got this data.

2

basically said we'll give it to you ever year, we'll

3

update it every six months for you.

4

give us credit.

5

having some -- there's some advantages to being an

6

academic.

Luan Cox at Crowdnetics has

Have fun, and just

So we're kind of looking forward to

7

So these are our numbers on the angel market,

8

and we go all the way back -- I just kind of cut it off

9

at 2005.

10

We kind of just go through one recession after

another, so let's start in the last post-recession.

11

You can see what happens here.

The market was

12

humming along at about 25 billion.

13

Recession or the whatever it was called, it got a little

14

clobbered, and the -- down to about 19, 17 to $19

15

billion.

16

mind billions here.

17

much, and I'll show you on a chart.

18

Right after the Great

These are still big markets, though.

Keep in

The deals really didn't change that

But right now to give you the latest numbers,

19

2014, and we're collecting 2015 right now, we've got

20

about 320 angels -- 320,000 angels actively investing in

21

about 73,000 deals, about $24 billion market.

22

is in '15 you're going to see a slight uptick in that,

23

probably not a lot of change.

24

and you see what happened.

25

see, not the carnage of course, but the deals actually

My guess

But here's the carnage,

It was kind of nice for us to

Page 86
1

held their own during the big drawdown.

2

went way down.

3

So valuations

And it was easier to get in.

So the top line, which the big precipitous drop

4

is the money going into the market.

5

I'm color blind.

6

I believe is blue, is the one that is the deals.

7

held pretty steady throughout the turmoil.

8

just valuations went down which in some ways is not a bad

9

thing, and I'll talk a little bit about some valuations

10
11

And the line -- and

So I think one of them, the darker one
So that

And basically

that are going on right now.
So if we look at the graph, and let's show

12

where the gaps are here, that funding gap that's existing

13

in the seed and startup market, that's not going

14

anywhere, and you'll see some other numbers that indicate

15

that it's not going anywhere.

16

money there.

17

tremendous service to the U.S. economy, to job

18

generation, to investing, but it's a lot of heavy

19

lifting, and we just need more of that.

20

way, some clever public policy to facilitate the

21

development of that market.

22

We clearly need some more

The angel groups that are there are doing a

We need some

The crowdfunding, my best estimate is picking

23

up that little piece of that funding gap.

24

nice, but I really don't see it filling in that whole gap

25

because to be perfectly honest if you've got a deal, all

Some, which is

Page 87
1

things other equal and one of them has a hundred

2

investors who never wrote a check before and they each

3

have common stock versus a clean deal, you'd probably go

4

with the clean deal.

5

the numbers.

6

Again, that remains to be seen with

Now what are the angels investing in?

7

you're going to see the healthcare.

8

up.

9

maybe a couple more rounds, maybe some VC rounds.

So now

The healthcare comes

Remember those deals are going to take a bunch,
But

10

there's definitely some dynamics in that market that

11

works with the angel industry.

12

feel free to ask questions at any time.

13

And by the way, please

So the healthcare is always kind of a good one

14

there, but the real soft spot is the software, and I

15

shouldn't have used the term soft spot.

16

is -- you could take that deal and in many cases you

17

could do two rounds as an angel, maybe syndicate the

18

second round with some other groups that you work with

19

and take that all the way to exit.

20

But the software

There's a lot of Dells and Microsofts and

21

Apples waiting to buy some really good startups, avoid

22

themselves doing R&D.

23

It's a nice clean exit on a sale.

IPO is a glamor exit, but, boy, a sale is nice, clean,

24

there's no lockup period.

25

everybody walks away pretty good.

It's usually a cash deal,
There hasn't been too

Page 88
1

much dilution.

2

So that's a very good investment strategy for

3

the angel groups, and you're seeing about a quarter of

4

the deals are in that space.

5

It's kind of up and down.

Biotech has had its heyday.
A lot of that is the

6

bioinformatics.

7

That's really all the social media stuff, app

8

development, all kinds of things like that.

9

up and down.

The retail and media, be careful.

IT services,

The industrial energy is the clean tech.

10

It had its heyday in 2011.

11

That was when there was a lot of government programs if

12

you recall on the bailout money.

13

2017 (sic) was a big jump.

Now here's some hard numbers on deal sizes for

14

angels.

15

a little idea of valuations.

16

350,000 per deal.

17

deals, five to six investors.

18

about $75,000 in it.

19

And this goes back from '08 to '14, so give you
Deal size is about 3 to

Now there's several investors in those

Roughly around 10 to 15 percent equity is being

to 2.7 million.

25

Valley colleagues here, but they tend to -- the

That includes U.S.

That

That's not Silicon

valuations may be getting a little excited out there

2

shall we say.

3

Okay.

But I'll -- I have other data on that one.
Here's the yield rates.

This is now

4

5

6

site.

7

9

ones you look at, the numerator -- yeah, the numerator is

So remember the crowdfunding was 20

These are vetted.

These are screened deals.

And so you're looking

So you've got the denominator is the

10

the ones you actually invest in.

11

15, 20 percent is the vetted deals.

12

By

Roughly around 10 to

Now when those numbers change, it's really

13

tough.

14

more bad deals?

15

back to during the heydays of 2000 running about a

16

quarter -- 25 percent, that's a little bit unsustainable.

17

Is it a numerator or a denominator?

More deals,

You saw what happened, that number goes

It's now running around 20 percent.

A lot more people

18

are understanding the angel market, especially

19

entrepreneurs.

20

Let's turn to the venture capital market.

21

Remember, angels 350,000 deal sizes, 73,000 companies

22

roughly, $2 and a half million valuations.

23

almost a $60 billion industry.

24
25

We got a 58,

million per deal and about 4,000 companies, not seed

stage at all.

3

So here's the story.

Because everybody

4

remembers the story rather than those boring numbers.

5

there is a well -- this is a true story -- a well-known

6

venture capitalist was visiting a friend of his.

7

rented her garage out to two Stanford students who were,

8

in fact, starting a search engine.

12

students, a search engine, no way.

And this VC who will

And his comment was:

How can I get out of the house without getting anywhere
near that garage?
Well, of course nobody took the flyer on Page

cofounder of Sun Microsystems, $100,000.

18

the S1 forms when it went public, Andreas made quite a

19

killing on that deal.

If you look at

21

2015 of which 185 in the entire United States were seed

22

25

It's not a seed and startup industry.

Now here's the scary part.

means that we are really drying up that seed market.

25 percent seed and startup deals
So

10

here's the two problems here.

11

crowdfunding taking the little piece, you've got the seed

12

and startup even on a good day is tough, and then you've

13

got the VCs pulling way to the right and so we're opening

14

up that 1 to $3 million capital gap.

15

You've got the

And then if you look on way off to that slide

16

to the right -- and I have to mention this for sake of

17

people talking about it, but if I hear one more unicorn,

18

I'm going to get sick.

19
20

These are $1 billion valuations.

You realize there's only 230 of those worldwide.

It

bears watching, that's what I'll say.

21

Yes, Catherine.

22

MS. MOTT:

Jeff, I'm really glad you're showing

23

this because one of the things I've been thinking about

24

is when I -- especially when I -- of course I follow your

25

numbers, I give you our numbers.

Page 92
1

DR. SOHL:

That's right.

2

MS. MOTT:

The average per deal with a VC

3

market being about 13.4 million per deal, they're --

4

they've moved upstream.

5

there a -- like an upside down bell-shaped curve so to

6

speak?

7

like VCs, we used to see a lot of VCs in 50 to 150 under

8

management.

9

sure NVCA has this -- has the data.

What I'm thinking about is is

We have a lot of micro-investors, very few --

But I don't know what the data is, and I'm
But how many VCs are

10

active in that 100 -- that 50 to a $150 million market?

11

And how many are there that are a billion and over?

12

I mean where's -- so the gap -- my sense of it

13

is there's a lot of angel investors out there, and you

14

said it right.

15

and they're acting like micro VCs.

16

we're all starting -- I mean even the angel groups are

17

starting to have microfunds that they're managing.

18

there's also this critical thing is the reason sometimes

19

angels can't invest in new deals is because they have to

20

invest in follow-on rounds to extend the runway to make

21

sure those companies are successful because there are no

22

50 to $100 million funds in their backyard.

23

Even the angel groups have moved upstream
We're syndicating,

But

So I guess I'd like to see the data somehow

24

sliced and diced so that we could understanding this

25

funding gap is how many of the VCs all moved to these

Page 93
1

billion dollar funds and how many are available for

2

extending the runway.

3

around what the data might look like.

4

DR. SOHL:

And I'm just trying to get my head

Yeah.

And we have that.

I can give

5

you a little thumbnail if I'm not held to actual

6

percentages here.

7

follow up on your point, Catherine, that 1 to 3 million

8

is that syndication, because, hey, somebody's got to do

9

that round.

But you're absolutely right.

You've got to do that second round.

10

aren't going near that round now.

11

Series A, the first VC fund.

12

you get outside equity.

13

But -- so somebody has to be in that 1 to 3.

14

And to

The VCs

And I always here, oh,

Series A is the first time

I don't care what you call it.

We're seeing two players in that.

As you said,

15

the angel groups syndicating, getting a little bigger,

16

micro-VCs.

17

little bifurcated.

18

funds that could do -- they could move.

19

your 500, 600 million.

20

the elephants, you can't move, you can't do a deal.

21

cannot do a 300,000, even a million dollar deal.

22

not worth your effort to -- it's not economically

23

feasible.

24

the market.

25

Then the venture capital market is getting a
There's these 20, 30, $40 million
Then you've got

They're not dinosaurs, they're
You

It's

So we're seeing a pretty big bifurcation in

I haven't -- really I have not kind of played

Page 94
1

with the '15 numbers yet, but we're seeing that in the

2

'14.

3

two ends are going to be the 20 to 50, maybe $100 million

4

funds, somewhat nimble, can work in that 1 to $3 million

5

range, and then you've got the big 200, 500, $700 billion

6

funds.

7

thing is deals come to -- I mean investors come to where

8

there's good deals, so there's money to be made in that 1

9

to $3 million market.

So think of it as your upside-down bell-shape, the

That's what we're seeing.

And remember the good

But again, my big fear is if that

10

money gets reallocated from angel investing seed startup

11

to angel investing post-seed, then we lose our acorns.

12

And again, from a market perspective, that's my big

13

concern.

14
15

And I think -- oh, I've got one more.
There it is.

Abraham Lincoln.

We're in D.C.

Hold on.
I used to

live here for 10 years.

MS. HANKS:

I used to love running around
So this is a quote.

"I know of

So classic

Thank you very much.

Thanks, Jeff.

Can I take you back

22

to one of the things that you said very early about the

23

whole crowdfunding?

24

DR. SOHL:

25

MS. HANKS:

Mm-hmm.
It seems like you're treating the

Page 95
1

crowdfunding bit as a separate silo.

2

in the market is anything that is online tends to be a

3

kind of hybrid.

4

funding platforms, you're getting some revenues from the

5

funding platforms, but at the same time there's an

6

offline portion of that.

7

being 4 to 1 or 10 to 1 offline to online.

8
9

And yet what I see

Where you're going onto one of the

And frequently we see the ratio

So two points, which is I think crowdfunding is
not a separate animal here.

It's sometimes -- in many

10

cases, it is a separate extension.

11

about some of the numbers I see from some of the

12

platforms who say Company X listed on our platform and

13

they raised $4 million.

14

raise $4 million, but the bulk of it was offline.

15

do you pass -- how do you control for that?

16

DR. SOHL:

I'm also very dubious

Where of course Company X did
So how

Yeah, and that's an excellent point.

17

The thing -- the 4 to 1 and the 10 to 1, by your saying

18

offline/online, online from online platforms and offline

19

being angel group meetings and --

20

MS. HANKS:

21

DR. SOHL:

Traditional angels, yeah.
Sure.

And those could possibly be

22

two rounds, two separate rounds.

23

the crowdfunding is, these are X shares for Y dollars,

24

and as we all know with angels, you sit down at the table

25

and that's all negotiable.

Because the thing with

And they're not going to --

Page 96
1

you come up with I'll sell you X shares for Y dollars,

2

and they're going to show you the door almost as fast as

3

if you bring your lawyer.

4

is the crowdfunding -- and I'm not seeing -- I do see

5

them as separate.

6

don't see the crowdfunding bringing the value adds that

7

the angels do.

8

So I think the way I see that

I'll be perfectly honest.

Because I

And I also see if you take a classic angel

9

investor -- and again, we're all different obviously, but

10

let's try to get to the mean a little bit -- is cash down

11

entrepreneur, knowledge in this industry, active part of

12

their portfolio, want to give something back, and this is

13

full-contact investing.

14

they want to get a board seat and help everything.

15

They enjoy this, they do it and

Crowdfunding I see you cannot -- it's face-to-

16

face in the angel market.

17

over 90 percent of your deals are within a half a day's

18

travel time of your principal residence.

19

has not changed since 1978.

20

in today's world of Skypes and everything else.

21

never changed.

22

Remember the angel market,

That statistic

And I mean that is amazing
That has

So the crowdfunding is this distance-type thing

23

where you lose the money where you lose the value add.

24

So in some ways I do tend to look at it as a separate

25

market.

Page 97
1

MS. HANKS:

And we do see these hybrid deals

2

where we know there is a lead angel out there and

3

sometimes they're even named, and it's usually

4

piggybacking on their terms.

5

DR. SOHL:

Right, but I don't consider Angel

6

List as anything but a crowdfunding platform with an

7

angel acting as a mini VC getting a carry.

8

that's cruel, but I see the classic angel, they'll be a

9

lead investor.

And maybe

Sure, there will be five to seven, maybe

10

ten people doing the deal, writing, negotiating, sitting

11

on the board seats.

12

aggregator of somebody who wants to do and deal and lead

13

it.

14

as an academic.

15

Angel List seems to me like an

So -- and I could very well be being way too harsh

MR. YADLEY:

So sort of a follow-up to that.

16

As angels are aggregating -- and I think, Catherine,

17

you've told us a lot in past committee meetings about how

18

the organization is attracting more people to the angel

19

networks and they're becoming more knowledgeable in

20

bringing new funds.

21

cyclicality to this sort of like people get out of B

22

school, and they want to work for Goldman Sachs, but as

23

soon as they know everything, they want to be on their

24

own or they want to go work at Fenwick & West and learn

25

from Stephen, and then go off and start their own firm?

Do you think that there will be a

Page 98
1

Do you think as these angels -- will they morph

2

into these sort of mini-funds as you've described them

3

and then go out because I believe what you said, that

4

people want good deals, and they're jealous of the good

5

deals, and they really don't like sharing information

6

about the best deals.

7

of a pendulum swing back to smaller, maybe one or twosies

8

in the angel world?

9

DR. SOHL:

So do you think there may be sort

Yeah, and certainly there's -- my

10

crystal ball gets a little cloudy at times even though

11

we're not supposed to say that as a snotty academic.

12

sure they're going to go where the deals are and where

13

the returns are.

14

retreat from seed because the 1 to $3 million deals are

15

pretty sweet.

16

got a little bit of customers, slight less risk, a little

17

closer to exit, not much, but a little closer.

18

But

So if there is, as is going now, this

You've got a little bit of runway, you've

So there's -- and there's not a lot of players

19

in there, not a lot of competition certainly in most

20

parts of the country except that area in the left coast.

21

And so you've got -- so the money would normally move

22

into that.

23

that then retreats, then does the seed and startup market

24

become that much more attractive, less players, better

25

deals, much lower valuations.

It's a return, risk-return tradeoff.

Now as

Maybe just no runway or a

Page 99
1

little bit less, but you can get to that second round

2

runway.

3

long-term in this industry is three years maybe.

So yes, it will take the long-term or maybe

4

What I fear is that in the meantime we may

5

really lose the seed market, and then -- and that could

6

be too draconian.

7

public policy, keep an eye on that seed, because that's

8

hard work.

9

can help angels in that market.

I just would like to see a little

It's really heavy lifting.

And any way we

We've done a lot of work

10

in Europe, and matching funds at seed and startup deals,

11

boy that helps a lot.

12

I mean these are not -- these are federal level

13

funds over in Europe where they can grab a certain amount

14

of money on a 4 to 1 basis where the angel puts in let's

15

say 400,000 and 100,000 comes from some other fund.

16

ride along in the terms.

17

grows and it's -- but it's a government fund, but not a

18

government-run fund.

They

If it's a success, that fund

19

That kind of tweaking would at least give me a

20

little more solace that that angel market will always --

21

that seed and startup market will remain a viable entity

22

and then possibly scoot up and down.

23

troughs, because I don't want to be in a trough too long.

24
25

No, even out the

Jeff, in addition to that, I spent

some time in Europe last week with the angel groups, or I

3

them and allows them to learn how to be sophisticated

4

investors.

5

Canada as well.

6

The -- it brings new angels to the

So those matching funds have done well in

DR. SOHL:

Yeah, we did the -- we helped

8

That was the Netherlands, that was Belgium.

9

doing very good, those funds.

They're

That's where they got the

10

term from, but of course they spell it differently.

11

then the Canadian work we've been doing, Canada is very -

12

- I think they're pretty astute on watching that seed

13

market.

14

MR. NELSON:

And

So I was just -- a couple of other

15

little data points.

16

House and Mayor Bloomberg's office on immigration for

17

entrepreneurs coming here from overseas.

18

created the Entrepreneur in Residence program at USCIS,

19

they were actually able to open up an 01 visa which means

20

exceptional talent visa for entrepreneurs that came who

21

had gotten funding on one of these crowdfunding

22

platforms.

23

We've actually worked with the White

And when they

Because if I'm not mistaken, the statistics are

24

there's about 140,000 startup profiles on Angel List and

25

less than 1 percent of those get funded every year.

And

Page 101
1

so it's harder for you to actually raise money on Angel

2

List than it is for you to get into Harvard.

3

absolutely agree almost all of it -- it's an introduction

4

platform, and it helps angels become kind of mini VCs and

5

be able to help syndicate the deal for some of the hard

6

work.

7

And I

Another data point that you had asked, Samir

8

Kaji, who is director of private equity at First Republic

9

Bank, recently published an article on CB insights.

He

10

was tracking about 100 funds in the sub-$30 million range

11

that had popped up in the last year and a half.

12

those funds are essential because before I introduced one

13

of our companies from our community to them, I'm asked to

14

have that company have between 5 and $10,000 a month in

15

recurring revenue and growing 7 percent month over month

16

before I introduce them to a seed fund.

17

seed fund is now growth equity.

18

DR. SOHL:

So in my mind, a

But again, that's that 1 to #3

19

million pot in that what I call post-seed.

20

just be semantics.

21
22
23

MR. NELSON:

But

So it may

That would be -- these are funds

that ostensibly write 250 and 500K checks.
DR. SOHL:

Yeah, but I mean seed -- I always

24

think of seed as not really having a lot of runway yet,

25

but again, that's just -- it's semantics.

The VCs will

Page 102
1

swear they're seed investors because they're looking from

2

one end down and vice versa.

MR. GRAHAM:

DR. SOHL:

for Financial Markets.

14

access to capital for small businesses and the

15

implications of financial technology in that and other

16

spaces.

17

I'm from the Milken Institute Center
Part of the work we do looks at

So last year, in conjunction with the National

18

Center for the Middle Market, we did a survey of 636

19

owners and c-suite executives of private companies --

20

there were a couple of public companies that slipped in -

21

- -with total annual revenues ranging from under a half

22

million to a billion dollars.

23

administered last January to early February.

24

was to provide a snapshot of how these companies are

25

accessing external capital, how they anticipate accessing

The survey was
The goal

Page 103
1

external capital and what is -- what factors they

2

consider when looking at external capital.

3

Our key findings, one, that debt was the

4

preferred method of outside financing, that firms when

5

they were evaluating methods of outside financing they

6

valuated the price that they were going to have to pay to

7

get the financing obviously, but also the ease of access,

8

the speed of the funding and the certainty that they were

9

going to get the funds in good order.

10

Firms were uncertain about whether bank or non-

11

bank financing was superior, but a lot of these firms had

12

strong preexisting relationships with their banks, and

13

that was cited as one of the major reasons why they used

14

bank funding.

15

At the time -- and this may be a little bit

16

stale, because of course this was pre a lot of the JOBS

17

Act provisions actually becoming effective -- there was a

18

low level of understanding and a low level of interest in

19

these potential models.

20

data on that here shortly.

21

And we'll see some of the actual

First we asked these companies what methods of

22

capital have they used in the past three years.

23

can see, the -- it was a tie between a loan from a bank

24

and they didn't raise outside capital.

25

operated off retained funds or they didn't exist three

As you

They just

Page 104
1

years before.

2

operating on retained funds or a loan from a non-bank

3

lender, then a debt investment from family and friends,

4

then money from a family office, then an equity

5

investment from family and friends.

6

pretty far down on their list before you reached an

7

equity investment.

8
9

After the bank, the next options were

So you had to get

The types of firms that -- or the types of debt
that these firms had, bank debt was a predominate model

10

across revenue bands.

11

a firm got, roughly speaking, and the smallest firms were

12

more likely to have no debt at all.

13

Private debt increased the larger

We asked them in the -- and then this next

14

year, so it's a year that just passed, how do you

15

anticipate funding your expansion plans.

16

was the largest answer, then going to existing -- their

17

existing credit facilities.

18

expansion, and 19 percent said that they would take on

19

additional debt, and then everything else fell into an 8

20

percent bucket.

21

DR. BAUGUESS:

22

MR. KNIGHT:

23

DR. BAUGUESS:

Cash on hand

20 percent had no plans for

Can I ask a question?
Sure.
How did you select these 600-

24

plus firms, and what was their general characteristics?

25

What was the identification method.

Page 105
1

MR. KNIGHT:

So first we used a survey firm to

2

identify -- there is -- we went for a -- we banded it by

3

tiers, and I don't have -- I believe it's in the -- I

4

should mention we have -- the report's available online,

5

and my colleague, Jackson, in the back here has copies if

6

you want them.

7

We tried to match revenue band and industry

8

with their representation in the broader economy.

9

then we used a nationwide survey, so --

10

DR. BAUGUESS:

And

I asked because I'm wondering

11

how much is growth firms versus somebody owns their

12

restaurant or three restaurants or something like a

13

mature, established business.

14

that you see here, there must be some sort of

15

preconceived notion of stable revenue streams.

16

does that -- I mean it seems like a big contrast from the

17

other types of angel and startup and VC-type entities.

18

MR. KNIGHT:

Right.

Given the level of debt

So how

So -- and I think you hit

19

on a good point which is that the purpose of this survey

20

was to try to get a snapshot of the economy as a whole.

21

So everyone from companies that expect to grow

22

significantly, companies that are quite large with up to

23

a billion dollars in revenue to the small, little mom and

24

pop shops.

25

I mean our view was that there's a lot of

Page 106
1

interest, there's a lot of focus on potentially high-

2

growth companies, and there's good reasons as to why.

3

But there are also a lot of companies that are maybe

4

flying under people's radar because they're smaller

5

companies, they don't necessarily have a clear path to

6

exit or clear goal to significant expansion, but they

7

still -- they hire people, they provide a living, they

8

provide a value to the community.

9

In terms of funding near-term expansion plans,

10

the use of cash on hand actually increased the larger a

11

firm was, which makes sense.

12

cash on hand.

13

what do you expect.

14

percent, did not expect to raise capital.

15

that's optimism that they're not going got need to or

16

pessimism that they won't be able to is unclear.

17

They're more likely to have

We then asked them in the next three years
Most -- the largest group, 40
Now whether

The next largest group, of course, was loan

18

from a bank, non-bank lender, retain funds, debt

19

investment, family offer -- and then one interesting

20

thing is that debt investment from family and friends and

21

equity investment from family and friends actually did a

22

little bit better forward-looking than they did rearward-

23

looking.

24

accessing securities market or what, but there's a slight

25

uptick there relative to what they had done in the past.

So I don't know if that is more interest in

Page 107
1

In terms of the factors -- and I think this is

2

really some of the most interesting and potentially

3

relevant information that came out of the study.

4

companies are looking at how they're going to get

5

financing, just generally, obviously the interest rate,

6

the cost of funding is very important to a majority of

7

them and extremely important.

8

component of extreme importance is the cost.

9

it's ease, speed and certainty.

10

When

The largest sort of
But then

Things like knowledge and expertise of the

11

industry from the funder, which of course would be

12

relevant on more or an equity angel investment side,

13

important but not critical; tax advantages, important but

14

not critical; diversification of funding source is

15

apparently not that important.

16

going to pay for this money, how quickly am I going to

17

get it, how certain is it that I'm going to get it, how

18

easy is it for me to get it.

19

Really it's how much am I

When using -- when looking at non-banks for

20

financing, again, you had better interest rate, ease of

21

access, certainty and speed.

22

a better interest rate was very -- was obviously

23

important, this seemed to be -- the ease, speed and

24

certainty seemed to also become important.

you look down at the bottom, the funding and asset

important thing to them, but it has an importance to a

3

large group of them, and I suspect that's because they're

4

looking at specialty funding.

5

you're not going to sort of a general bank, you may be

6

looking at specialty funding, and so you want something

7

that matches your special need.

8
9
10
11

We asked:

If you're not going --

Do you think that non-bank sources

of funding are superior or inferior to banks?

And

frankly I'll admit that when I saw this I was surprised.
It's almost a 33-33-33 split.

Banks are -- 37 percent

12

consider banks to be superior to non-banks, but 35

13

percent don't know, and 28 percent don't think that

14

they're superior.

15

MR. NELSON:

When you actually talk about

16

nontraditional lenders, is that banks versus credit cards

17

versus someone who might loan me money?

18

about those distinctions a little bit?

19

MR. KNIGHT:

Can you talk

So nontraditional lenders are non-

20

bank business lenders, not credit cards, generally issued

21

by a bank, but things like I mean a marketplace lender, a

22

specialty finance, cash -- emerging cash advance, any --

23

and it is sort of a big pot I will admit, but that sort

24

of non-bank specialty small business lending.

25

DR. BAUGUESS:

Uh-oh.

While they're working on

Page 109
1

technical challenges, with respect to the banks, is --

2

are these community banks, local banks, bigger banks?

3

MR. KNIGHT:

4

DR. BAUGUESS:

5

MR. KNIGHT:

6

DR. BAUGUESS:

All banks.
All banks.
All banks.
Is there a local nature of the

7

financing for these smaller loans that it's more likely

8

for a small bank to loan to small business than to go to

9

a national bank?

10

MR. KNIGHT:

Well, our survey did not ask into

11

that.

12

there, but that was not the focus of our survey.

13

I do think that there's some good information out

This other part I think is particularly

14

interesting is that the larger a bank -- or the larger a

15

company is, the more they like banks and the less they

16

like non-banks, which I think makes a ton of sense

17

because of course the larger a company is, they're

18

probably more likely to get a bank loan on terms they

19

like, they're more likely to have a longstanding

20

relationship with a bank.

21

Whereas the smaller a company is, the less

22

likely it is they're going to be able to get a bank loan

23

on terms they like or at all and the more they may need a

24

different -- which is another thing that came out of this

25

is that the smaller companies are more interested in

Page 110
1

getting a quick -- money quickly, get money with

2

certainty, get money easily.

3

institutions deprioritized that relatively speaking and

4

looked more at the raw cost of the funds.

5

Whereas the larger

We asked them why would they take -- why would

6

they consider borrowing from a bank, and overwhelmingly

7

it's their strong previous relationship with their bank.

8

It's not that taking on additional debt is better than

9

other options including selling equity in their company.

10
11

It's not that the terms are superior.

It's that they

know and like and have a relationship with their bank.

12

That -- the strong consideration element is

13

relatively consistent across revenue bands.

14

additional debt is better than other options ticked up

15

generally speaking the larger or the more revenue a firm

16

had.

17

generally they felt like they could borrow around the

18

prevailing rate.

19

were borrowing below the prevailing rate, 7 percent

20

above.

These firms' perceptions of borrowing costs,

21
22

About a quarter of them thought they

Do you have that broken down by

23

MR. KNIGHT:

MS. YAMANAKA:

The taking

By source of -So meaning that the people who

thought they were getting a deal, below market rate, was

Page 111
1

that because of friends and family or was that across all

2

lending sources?

3

MR. KNIGHT:

Unfortunately we did not have that

4

-- I should preface by saying that our survey firm told

5

us that we were really limited to about 30 questions or

6

people are just going to bounce off.

7

broad survey, so that's something that we wish we could

8

have gone down on and hopefully on a follow-up we can

9

dive into that.

10

And this was a

11

14

appropriate, and no one wanted to be highly leveraged.

Another almost half wanted to keep it under 20

7 percent thought around 50 percent was

MR. YADLEY:

Brian, did any of your questions

16

go to when people were borrowing whether there was --

17

were enhancements like equity kickers or anything like

18

that?

19

MR. KNIGHT:

No, we did not go that deeply.

We

20

felt that that might be a little bit difficult to convey

21

in the type of survey we were running.

22

question.

23

But it's a good

Those tended

7

decisions.

Another 26 percent said that they borrowed when

8
9

The -- 26 percent had no

And I think that this is important.
My suspicion is that this is important going

back to that bank relationship and bank superiority

10

question, which is if you're not constantly accessing

11

your bank, you have to -- when you run out of money, when

12

you need money, when you want to do something you go and

13

you get a loan.

14

and you felt pretty comfortable with that, you're going

15

to have -- and particularly if you also have other

16

products with that bank, your bank checking account, your

17

bank credit card or your corporate credit card, et

18

cetera, you're going to have a strong relationship with

19

your bank.

20

And if the last time the bank said yes

Now if the next time you go in the future,

21

which you don't know yet, they say no, that may impact

22

your relationship with your bank, that may impact your

23

perception of how good bank funding versus non-bank

24

funding is.

25

MS. TIERNEY:

Brian.

Page 113
1

MR. KNIGHT:

2

MS. TIERNEY:

Yes.
One of the things that I would

3

like to know -- like you were talking about doing some

4

follow-up with this, but you also need to maybe look at a

5

lot of these businesses, the first thing they're doing,

6

oh, money, oh, I need to talk to my banker.

7

you said in here a lot of it is because maybe those

8

businesses don't understand VCs, they don't understand

9

some of the other types of markets they could utilize,

10

but sometimes it's beyond them understanding and their

11

influencers and getting the information out to the

12

bankers.

13

going to go to my CPA.

14

And I know

Because you think of a tax implication, oh, I'm

You don't think of, oh, I'm going to look at

15

SEC filings or paperwork and so I think that's one thing

16

that would be good to take into consideration, that maybe

17

it's not so much that they didn't know, but their expert

18

that they refer to for ease -- because I've seen other

19

federal agencies get a bad rap for, oh, well, this one

20

said no because when they talk about regulations, well,

21

it wasn't truly the regulation.

22

wanting to fill out the paperwork, that banker maybe not

23

being as familiar with the process, just as a side note.

24
25

MR. KNIGHT:

It was that entity not

Yeah, that's a good point.

And I

will say I omitted from this slide -- it's contained in

Page 114
1
2
3
4

the report, but we did have some questions about the SBA.
Almost no one used the SBA, no one liked the SBA and
they found it to be -- which is no knock against the SBA.
I think I saw Nate against the SBA here somewhere.

But

5

they found the process to be burdensome, cumbersome, time

6

consuming, difficult, and so they kind of -- a lot of

7

them bounced off that and went to go do something else.

8
9

MS. YAMANAKA:

And I have a lot of experience

in that and especially during the last couple years of

10

the SBA.

11

and their servicing client relationships for lack of

12

better words.

13

that if the intermediaries in the sense that the bankers

14

are not familiar with it, they're CPAs, the people who

15

are going to be the experts at presenting options, it's

16

not going to come up.

17

Frankly, they have improved their processing

But I think to your point, Lisa (sic), is

So I -- even -- it's -- you've got to get past the

18

barriers, the gatekeepers because business owners are not

19

experts in the SEC, in banking relationships, in tax or

20

anything.

21

don't know or if it doesn't come up or if -- sometimes I

22

have to really talk clients into things because they

23

don't want to take on debt or they don't want to pursue

24

alternatives.

25

and what their peer group is, too.

They look to their cadre of people and if they

They go with what they're familiar with

Page 115
1

So if they hear somebody -- that's why banking

2

is tremendous.

3

as having a particular specialty in an industry, which

4

will allow you theoretically greater latitude, then all

5

those industries group in that area.

6

some nuances in here that are not otherwise --

7

If a bank were -- develops a reputation

MS. YADLEY:

So I think there's

I think another thing may be --

8

and I don't know if you found this to be true -- going to

9

a bank -- because I think you're right, Lisa (sic).

10

People don't know about all these other lenders.

11

banks, even some relatively small banks under 20 billion,

12

are offering a lot of services.

13

But

So people call their bank, they're not just

14

getting a line of credit.

15

specialized finance groups, they have equity

16

relationships, and so I think for a lot of the companies

17

probably at the higher end of your range of companies,

18

going to the bank doesn't mean the same thing as when

19

you're at the lower end and you're really going to the

20

bank for a loan.

21

MR. KNIGHT:

They have all kinds of

I think -- my suspicion is that

22

that is absolutely true.

23

again, was meant to be sort of a high-level snapshot,

24

that does seem to vie with the information regarding how

25

the larger a company is, the fonder they were of their

I mean this survey, which,

Page 116
1

bank, the better they thought of the bank and bank

2

financing versus a small company, and that seems to jive

3

with other evidence out there that the danger is that

4

banks are retrenching from the smallest of the small.

5

The big companies, banks are still more than

6

happy to work with them, it makes sense, the regulators

7

are happy with it because it doesn't pose a significant

8

credit risk, it's profitable.

9

institution or a smaller company looking for a smaller

10

loan is riskier and the underwriting costs for a small

11

loan are not that much different from the underwriting

12

costs on a big loan.

13

Whereas a smaller

So you run that risk.

In terms of debt-to-asset ratio, the smaller

14

firms tended to be zero to five.

15

have a higher debt-to-asset ratio.

16

surprisingly, tended to have under a half million in

17

debt.

18

firms, the majority had over a half million in debt.

19

Some of them didn't know how much debt they had.

20

of that what you will.

21

Larger firms tend to
Smaller firms, not

Larger firms tended to have -- like the larger

So make

And going back to the earlier conversation

22

about awareness of nontraditional sources of capital, and

23

let me preface this by saying this survey is about a year

24

old, things have hopefully improved somewhat.

25

was relatively little awareness on the part of firms of

But there

Page 117
1

alternative sources of capital, private equity being the

2

most well-known.

3

venture capital, angel investors, peer-to-peer loans.

4

Of course we split out private equity,

So -- and I will say in the report we do

5

preface by saying we trusted people to use their judgment

6

in terms of language.

7

So you may want to lump private equity, venture capital,

8

angel investors all together, but obviously some people

9

viewed them differently.

10

DR. BAUGUESS:

It was hard to control for that.

What was the question?

11

know this exists and what it is?

12

how to get it if you wanted to pursue it.

13
14
15
16

MR. KNIGHT:

Do you

Or was it do you know

It's are you aware of it.

And so

-DR. BAUGUESS:

So 70 -- three-quarters of the

population didn't know what peer-to-peer lending was?

17

MR. KNIGHT:

18

MS. YAMANAKA:

Apparently so.
I'm not surprised at all.

That

19

is -- if you look at the broad spectrum, there's a huge

20

number of businesses out there that they have their eye

21

on their widget and their service.

22

they've been around for a long time.

23

looking at how to do what they know how to do.

24

Everything else they think is for -- or they all know --

25

they say, ah, that's just Silicon Valley, oh, that's what

And that's -- maybe
They are just

Page 118
1

we get -- oh, that's just a tech.

2

manufacturer.

3

think that all the private equity and venture capital --

4

they don't even want to talk to you about it.

5

their banks, they've always delivered, they know the

6

game, they know the rules.

7

I'm an old-fashioned

A very high-tech manufacturer, but they

They know

If I do this -- average -- if I produce this,

8

if I've got this cash flow, I know someone's going to

9

fund me.

On the other thing, it's a little bit -- it's

10

nebulous because it is about relationships and they

11

haven't established those relationships.

12

have a conduit to get them there quickly.

13

MR. YADLEY:

Nor do they

I think that's consistent with

14

your findings, too, Brian, that equity is way down what

15

they want to give and the banks by and large are not

16

asking for --

17

MR. KNIGHT:

Well, and I mean my sense is a lot

18

of these businesses are not good equity candidates.

19

would not be good for the business, it would not be good

20

for the investor because they're unlikely to have the

21

type of event that makes equity worthwhile.

22

MR. GRAHAM:

It

So again, Brian -- sorry, I talked

23

over someone.

24

when you are unaware of a type of source if you will and

25

then there's awareness that has to do with whether or not

Okay.

Again, Brian, there is awareness

Page 119
1

you understand that these sources are available, but you

2

have no one to contact.

3

tap into it.

4

I mean you have no idea how to

Do your numbers cover both?

MR. KNIGHT:

So the -- the most honest answer

5

is I don't know because the question is are you aware of

6

this sources of capital.

7

respondent when they said, like, I've never heard of this

8

before or I know vaguely that this exists, but I have no

9

idea if it would be appropriate for me, there may be some

So what was in the mind of the

10

conflation there.

11

have a question that teases that out.

12

But we don't -- so I can't -- we don't

MR. GRAHAM:

So di ton know --

Yeah, this kind of goes back to

13

outreach, which I think -- assumption that we should kind

14

of focus on as a committee.

15

Xavier.

16

MR. GUTIERREZ:

I was just going to ask a quick

17

question.

18

again post-all of the kind of growth in the marketplace

19

lender space, and in particular because of the fact that

20

you now have very large money center regional banks that

21

are starting to utilize those platforms for small dollar

22

amount lending, basically offloading anything sub-a

23

million dollars to those platforms and whether or not one

24

awareness is increasing as a result?

25

Is there a goal, Brian, of doing this survey

And two, as a bank owner, we're actually seeing

Page 120
1

a reaction against that because of the fact that while

2

ease and certainty kind of is there, the additional

3

services that go beyond just the capital are obviously

4

lacking.

5

back to not just community banks but to credit unions as

6

well, which is also another factor that I don't think has

7

been included in this.

8

asking:

9

over the last 12 months in marketplace lending?

10

And so there may actually be a retrenchment

So it's a long-winded way of

Are you guys going to redo it given the growth

MR. KNIGHT:

I certainly hope that there is an

11

update to this survey.

12

at the National Center for the Middle Market, but I

13

definitely think -- I agree with you.

14

would be value to it.

I haven't talked to my colleagues

I think there

15

And like I said, I mean, some of this

16

information I hope is stale because -- and we're going to

17

get to a couple more slides here where there is

18

relatively little understanding of some of the JOBS Act-

19

related changes and it's my hope that that has improved

20

over time, particularly as these have come online --

21

these regulations have in fact come online.

22

DR. BAUGUESS:

I just wanted to echo -- I mean

23

it's a great idea.

24

do our economic analysis, this is the type of information

25

issuers search.

Just from the SEC perspective when we

Costs and knowing where to get capital

Page 121
1

we have a really hard time measuring.

2

way to get this type of information.

3

repeat this and show us change, maybe even alter the

4

questions to ask specifically about new exemptions would

5

be extremely valuable information to have.

6

MR. KNIGHT:

7

MR. REARDON:

We don't have a
The extent that you

Sure.
Sebastian, is this an opportunity

8

for your group to maybe put some educational information

9

on your part of the website that says if your banks turn

10

you down, these are the other sources you go to?

11

the risk you run is that each one of these groups won't

12

like what you write about them.

13

I mean

But it seems to me that that might be something

14

that's useful even if you just link to somebody else's

15

narrative; if you're interested in venture capital, go to

16

this industry link or something like that.

17

somebody who just doesn't know what to do with a small

18

business, and I agree those people don't know, maybe

19

that's something that's not too hard to do and it's

20

helpful.

21

MR. GRAHAM:

But for

I think it would be helpful, and

22

that's what I was getting at when I mentioned outreach.

23

I mean it seems to me that there's an education

24

component, and I know that that's one of the things that

25

we certainly are kind of required to focus on through the

Page 122
1

JOBS Act and perhaps other areas as well, but it seems to

2

me that not only is -- are we lacking in terms of -- or

3

that we could do more in terms of outreach to issuers.

4

think we could probably do more in terms of figuring out

5

how to partner with sources as well.

6

There is -- there are foundations in other

7

organizations where I think they are sources of capital

8

that people don't fully appreciate.

9

you think about industry groups as well.

And for that matter,
So I think that

10

there's -- I think this is an important area, and it is

11

something that I think would -- it would be good if we

12

focus on it a little bit and maybe came up with some

13

ideas.

14

I

MR. GOMEZ:

I think it would be extremely

15

helpful for the committee to focus on it and especially

16

tee up potential ideas of how best to reach to people.

17

One of the things that we have been doing over the past

18

year and I expect not only will continue but will

19

increase now that the rules -- the major rulemaking in

20

the JOBS Act has been finalized is the SEC partner with

21

the SBA in order to actually reach out to different

22

locations throughout the country.

23

not necessarily go to the stereotypical location where

24

you expect you are going to find companies or

25

development, but also reach out to other areas that are

Part of the goal is

Page 123
1

not the traditionally sought after places.

2

against Boston, but let's think about is there places to

3

go other than Boston, other than the Silicon Valley where

4

we can also do outreach to groups that are interested in

5

funding.

6

So nothing

The one thing that I think that's a very

7

interesting topic for the committee to take up is I

8

personally what I find to be one of the most challenging

9

aspects of the outreach is when we go to some of these

10

events, there's a lot of interest from people in learning

11

about it.

12

up is:

13

about crowdfunding, you talked about Reg A, you talked

14

about this thing called 4(a)(2), and I have no idea which

15

one is the right one for me.

16

is right for me?

17

can provide as far as that guidance.

18

And then the next logical question that comes

Look, I have this great idea and you just talked

Can you tell me which one

And that is not something that the SEC

So I think one of the things that would be very

19

important for -- to hear from the committee is not only

20

what the outreach strategy should be try to get the best

21

bang for the buck as we are using our limited resources

22

to try to provide the message, but also how do we go

23

through that gap of this is what the rules are, but at

24

the same time we're not your lawyers, and we can't serve

25

as your lawyers or advisors.

How do we cross that gap so

Page 124
1

that they're actually able to not only get the

2

information about what the exemptions that are available,

3

but also what is the best one for that one company, which

4

of course will vary tremendously based on the type of

5

company and the situation in which they're at.

6

MR. NELSON:

I also think that one of the side

7

effects of the ban on general solicitation has been it's

8

been almost illegal for me to tell people that I'm

9

raising capital for my business up until a couple years

10

ago.

11

generally know how to raise capital for a business are

12

accredited investors who are rich by definition.

And so because of that, the only people who

13

So people who are not rich do not know that

14

being an angel is a thing.

15

angels or they don't know that people are angels that

16

they know.

17

consequence in the general solicitation thing where how

18

do I start my business, credit card or I take a second

19

mortgage out of my house.

20

going give me any money because I'm not profitable.

They probably don't know

And so I think there's been this unintended

The banks, no, they're not

21

And the frequent complaint that I hear about

22

entrepreneurs and one of the reason why people come to

23

Silicon Valley to raise capital is because the general

24

consensus around the world is that it's one of the few

25

places where there actually is a market for small stock

Page 125
1

equity, which I think if we can try to fix some of these

2

problems and make people more aware, we move the economy,

3

which I think is pretty awesome.

4

MR. GRAHAM:

5

MS. MOTT:

Catherine.
I think Sebastian's comment about

6

partnering with the SBA makes sense.

7

the one place that would make sense for everyone to go to

8

it and provide a consistent message and can deliver that

9

message to all its communities.

And because it's

One of the things I will

10

tell you in Pittsburgh, that we have a very, very

11

proactive innovation-focused mayor.

12

And he created an innovation office.

And it's

13

a one-stop shop where you can go and say I need an

14

incubator.

15

trying to get some NIH money.

16

for you to go get and to try to apply for NIH money.

17

there's a one-stop source there that provides a lot of

18

information.

Well, there's 20 incubators in town.

I'm

Here's some suggestions
So

19

I have seen in other communities -- this is not

20

trying to slap the SBDC on the hands, but SBDC in another

21

community which we are very active in where SBDC tells

22

all of the incubators is you don't need them, you just

23

need us.

24

among the things that are partnering with SBA.

25

can start with a general message with the SBA and kind of

So it's -- there's even a lack of understanding
So if we

Page 126
1

filter it into the -- all of the components that

2

integrate with the SBA, I think it might be a good start.

3

MR. REARDON:

Could I add to that that I think

4

the focus, if I don't know what venture capital is, the

5

starting point is probably not the SEC rules.

6

starting point is probably the forest and what is venture

7

capital.

8

videos because so few people read anymore.

9

we get -- I've got a face for radio, so I wouldn't be the

10
11
12
13

The

And perhaps even the way to do this is through

right person.

They want --

But get somebody to do it via talking --

MR. GRAHAM:

I don't know, Patrick.

I kind of

see you as -MR. REARDON:

No, you'd be much better.

You'd

14

be much better.

15

just turned you down.

16

five options or six options you've got and each one of

17

these is 10 minutes long and then there's more material

18

you can get if you want to read on it.

19

And somebody do a video of your bank
Well, we're going to tell you the

But I think if we start with -- well, a

20

relative of mine just got an award for outstanding

21

performance because she took a company's website and

22

focused it from what the company wanted to what the

23

customer wanted.

24

customer need.

25

hand and say here are the next steps for you, and by the

And here you've got to say what does my
And my customer needs you to hold their

Page 127
1

way, go get a lawyer who knows how to do all this stuff

2

because it's complicated.

3

MR. GOMEZ:

And, Patrick, I think we have the

4

perfect cast here for those videos because we have

5

members of all of those different groups.

6

angel investors, we have bankers.

7

we need to do and actually take a little bit more of your

8

time and actually have you record those videos.

9

MR. GUTIERREZ:

So we have

So maybe that's what

In all seriousness, this has

10

been an issue that we talk a lot about, which is this

11

continuum of capital, right?

12

people that what works today may not work for them

13

tomorrow, and by the way, you might not even know what

14

works for you today.

15

like to encourage sort of that understanding.

So -- and trying to educate

And so as we think about this, I'd

16

Obviously, the SEC sits in one particular

17

aspect of that continuum, but it's not in a vacuum.

18

Right?

19

to reiterate the point that it is very, very important to

20

educate the service providers of those companies.

21

Because at the end of the day, a small business is really

22

interested in making it, right, making payroll,

23

continuing to be profitable.

24

they turn to their accountant, and so really when you

25

talk about nontraditional platforms to go to, you'd be

And so I wanted to highlight that.

I also wanted

They turn to their lawyer,

Page 128
1

surprised how much education can actually get done by

2

going though those enterprises across this continuum of

3

capital.

So --

4

MR. GRAHAM:

5

Brian, we're going to let you finish.

6

MR. KNIGHT:

Thank you for that.

Okay.

Great.

So -- and

7

admittedly this one is I hope one of the staler slides

8

here.

9

the JOBS Act proposals.

Almost 80 percent of firms were unfamiliar with

10

Among --

MS. TIERNEY:

Does that go back to the

11

idea that before that a lot of the companies in the

12

survey are not the type of companies that would use

13

equity to raise capital, or do you think it's a different

14

issue?

15

MR. KNIGHT:

So this is familiarity, so that's

16

more general.

17

90 percent at the time said that they would not consider

18

using one of these JOBS Act proposals.

19

said they would -- and admittedly this is a small sample.

20

We -- among those who were familiar, about

Among those who

The biggest reason was that they thought it would be

21

good public relations or followed by thinking it would be

22

-- provide better terms or be less expensive.

23

a quarter of those who were interested thought that they

24

wanted to expand their investor base.

25

Only about

Among those who were -- would be hesitant or

Page 129
1

unwilling to use the new methods, the biggest reason was

2

that they didn't know enough to feel comfortable, which

3

of course makes sense and followed by uncertainty, so we

4

can lump those together.

5

they wanted to know their investors, which I think has

6

been a recurring theme about the value add -- potential

7

value add to investors, particularly on the equity side.

8
9

Potential for fraud, and then

We asked if they were listed on a stock
exchange.

Only 3 percent said they were currently

10

listed.

11

92 percent said that they have not considered listing,

12

and 3 percent have considered it but haven't done it yet.

13

Surveys.

2 percent said they didn't know, so whatever.

Okay.

14

So biggest barrier to the companies of as to

15

why they wouldn't do it, the biggest one was that they

16

were just too small to consider going public, followed by

17

cost, regulation, and then lack of liquidity.

18

are themes that have been echoed again and again and

19

again.

20

really a good option for a significant chunk of

21

companies.

22

So these

One, the private -- or the public markets are not

That's just not -- to your continuum of capital

23

point, in that continuum of capital, I think it's very

24

fair to say that there are multiple forks in that road.

25

And so trying to -- we can fix and improve certain areas,

Page 130
1

and that will help with the companies that will travel

2

down that path and not necessarily help any of the other

3

companies, and that's something that people should be

4

mindful of.

5

And then I guess to sort of get to why any of

6

this matters in terms of expansion plans, 54 percent said

7

that their expansion plans would not change in response

8

to an increase of cost and capital.

9

would only respond to a significant interest rate swing,

28 percent said it

10

and 18 percent said that they were highly sensitive to

11

changes in cost and capital.

12

And then if you look, if we broke it down by

13

revenue band and the largest groups say it would not

14

change, where the smaller companies, the up to about $2

15

and a half million in revenue companies -- and my

16

suspicious is those are in a grow-or-die mode, we have to

17

do it, so we're going to do it.

18

-- on the other side, the smallest companies were also

19

relatively speaking the most sensitive to changes.

20

guess those are companies that are not in a grow-or-die

21

mode, but also don't have a lot of leeway in terms of the

22

money that they can raise.

23

But then the other side

That -- so that's the presentation.

And I

I'm, if

24

there are any additional questions, happy to answer them

25

or try to anyway.

Page 131
1
2

MR. GRAHAM:

Thank you, Brian.

So open it back

up for questions.

3

Greg.

4

MR. YADLEY:

Not a question so much, but I like

5

Sebastian's comment about the SEC's not the lawyer, so

6

you can feel free to give them Stephen's and my Texas

7

colleague's and my names anytime you want.

8

not the primary goal of the lawyer, although that is part

9

of our counseling.

But that is

One of the themes that's come up is

10

that people don't understand who these alternative

11

capital sources are.

12

among them.

If they do, they don't distinguish

13

Another tool in the arsenal, which obviously

14

our committee has talked about in the past, is private

15

placement brokers, somebody who may know you want this

16

kind of capital source, or I know these 10 people, and

17

really the goal is not to sell their capital or their

18

sponsored fund, but to match a source.

19

something we'll continue to talk about at our future

20

meetings.

21

MR. GRAHAM:

22

MS. HANKS:

So I hope that's

Okay.
Yeah, I certainly just wanted to

23

echo what Greg said about we need to get the finders

24

thing fixed.

25

one of our objectives.

This term of this committee, that should be
Do or die.

The other thing I

Page 132
1

just wanted to mention, carrying on from the banking

2

issue, there are some jurisdictions, UK being one of

3

them, where rules are being instituted for banks when

4

banks turn down a small business loan application.

5

They're required to say, well, we're not going to give

6

you anything, but here's another source.

7

Now that's a difficult thing to dictate when

8

you have 16 different banking jurisdictions, banking

9

authorities and then 50 different state ones, but there

10

might be something like that we could do on a voluntary

11

basis.

12

be interested in saying, well, you're too early for us,

13

but here, here's a crowdfunding platform.

14

And I have talked to some local banks who might

MR. KNIGHT:

If I might put one bug in the

15

committee's ear, and we've submitted a comment letter

16

touching on this, one of the things that struck me when I

17

looked at this data is just how interested people were in

18

debt as an option.

19

whether like the private offerings -- whether or not they

20

are well suited to debt offerings and whether the

21

structures and requirements around these private

22

offerings, many of which are built for either equity or

23

debt, or are capable of using either equity or debt,

24

whether or not there's any profitable way to -- if you

25

were to create a debt-specific offering, whether you

And I think it's worth considering

Page 133
1

could do it with sufficient and appropriate consumer

2

protection or investor protection while creating a lower

3

barrier because of the unique nature of debt.

4

suspicion is that there might be that possibility, and

5

that might be something that's at least worth

6

contemplating going forward.

7
8

MR. GRAHAM:

And so my

And that's -- you're talking about

pure debt as opposed to convertible debt?

9

MR. KNIGHT:

Pure, simple, vanilla debt.

10

Basically something that functionally competes with a

11

bank loan because that seems to be where most of the

12

demand is.

13

there may be an unmet or unfulfilled need.

14

this is going to replace banks or replace marketplace

15

lenders or replace anyone else.

16

And to the extent that banks are retrenching,
And not that

It's more to augment the suite of options

17

available because everyone's going to have different

18

needs, wants and options available to them.

19

can be created that works without creating undue risk to

20

investors, that might be a nice thing to have.

But if one

21

MR. GRAHAM:

22

Sebastian, are you going to address this kind

Thank you.

23

of where we are with the finder versus broker this

24

afternoon?

25

MR. GOMEZ:

So I'm hopeful that John, who was

Page 134
1

here this morning, will be available this afternoon in

2

case there's questions from the committee.

3

MR. GRAHAM:

Kind of find out where we are.

4

Okay.

Any more questions before we break for lunch?

5

Okay.

Then let's break for lunch.

6
7

(Whereupon, at 12:36 p.m. a brief luncheon
recess was taken.)

8
9

A F T E R N O O N
MR. GRAHAM:

Okay.

S E S S I O N
First we need to turn to a

10

bit of housekeeping.

11

But -- okay.

12

passing out current copies of the bylaws for your

13

information and for your future reference I guess.

14

The current bylaws of the committee were

I don't know if you have copies.

Generally, we pass out -- well, we'll be

15

adopted when the committee was formed in 2011.

16

committee was renewed by the Commission in 2015, there

17

was a change to the charter, which now states that the

18

members are appointed to serve essentially by the

19

Commission, and they will serve at the pleasure of the

20

Commission.

21

When the

The original bylaws provided that the committee

22

was to be appointed by the chair of the Commission.

23

that change was made.

24

with the Commission as a whole providing greater input,

25

and that's kind of the current fact of life.

So

The committee has reconstituted

Page 135
1
2
3
4

And so it's time to amend our bylaws so they
kind of conform with the reality of the current charter.
So what we need to do is remove three words:
the.

And that's it.

5

PARTICIPANT:

So moved.

6

MR. GRAHAM:

Thank you.

7

anyone want to talk about this?

8

in favor?

9
10
11
12

chair of

All right.
All right.

Does
So all those

(Chorus of ayes.)
MR. GRAHAM:

All those opposed?

All right.

We

have amended our bylaws.
Sebastian, will you provide the committee with

13

an update on the current status of rulemaking and other

14

initiatives at the Commission?

15

MR. GOMEZ:

Sure.

Happy to do it, and in many

16

ways the presentations this morning, especially by Scott,

17

cover a lot of the stuff that I was going to cover.

18

encourage you guys to chime in if you have questions or

19

if you have insight as to what you are seeing in the

20

different areas that I'll touch upon.

21

So I

So let me start by noting again that last year

22

the Commission finished all of the major rulemaking under

23

the JOBS Act.

24

talk about what we're seeing in the context of Reg A

25

offerings, but Scott stole my thunder and did it much

I had a section here where I was going to

Page 136
1

better than I could have done it and provided even more

2

data than I could have provided for you.

3

So I wasn't going to spend a whole lot of time

4

on Reg A unless you guys had some thoughts or some

5

insight as to what you've seen or you experience there.

6

MR. HAHN:

I was going to say earlier, so we

7

went public in January of 2014, but in 2012 and early

8

2013, we were in a position where our lead compound was

9

in a phase 2 and we needed further funding.

So we didn't

10

have the data yet to access the public markets for an

11

IPO.

12

and Reg A popped up.

13

million limit on that.

So we were looking at a lot of different avenues,

14

At the time it was only a $5

The 50 million Reg A+ would have been perfect

15

for us at that point because it would have given us an

16

opportunity to raise the money.

17

IPO was that we had to spend $2 and a half million on

18

lawyers, accountants and not knowing if we were actually

19

going to be able to close a deal.

20

The challenge with the

I do think the one challenge, though, going

21

forward, though, is liquidity issue on the markets on the

22

back end.

23

before Reg A+ this was addressed is a lot of the public

24

investors will, in the last several years in the biotech

25

area, have started making investments in private

On the private side, I think the way that

Page 137
1

companies.

2

lot of the deal terms are structured whereas they'll do

3

the crossover round in the company, but there are certain

4

stipulations in the agreement that says if they don't go

5

public within the next 12 to 18 months, the crossover

6

investors will get more of the company.

7

But they call those crossover rounds.

And a

So I think Reg A+ is -- it's great, it's

8

another tool in the toolbox to help companies in that

9

type of position raise money.

But I do -- there is --

10

we're going to have to take a look at the liquidity side

11

and, yeah, there are some other conversations about other

12

markets for these securities before they're actually

13

public.

14

MS. HANKS:

If I could just say something about

15

the implementation of Reg A, we've done six separate

16

filings.

17

and gotten nine rounds of comments, and they were

18

uniformly useful, helpful, not nitpicky.

19

foot fault of like how we've not quite filed something

20

right in part one, nobody picks us up on it.

21

We've done filings for six separate companies

When we have a

They call us and say we think you might like to

22

amend that they don't even say and you should have known

23

that, Sara.

24

so the implementation is great.

25

And so it's been terrifically helpful.

I absolutely second the stuff about the

And

Page 138
1

liquidity.

2

for the investors.

3

the adopting release and the assumptions that DERA made

4

about who would be using this, I think that the fact that

5

there is a whole load of pre-revenue companies using tier

6

two, and that's something I think possibly that the

7

commission wasn't expecting.

8

to see a lot more of those.

9
10
11

That's going to be a huge, huge, huge thing
But one thing that when you look at

MR. GOMEZ:
thoughts.

But you're probably going

Thank you.

Thank you for all those

I've -- I did not introduce Joanne Rutkowski.

Joanne is in the Division of Trading and Markets.

And I

12

was reminded by this because I was going to jump into

13

crowdfunding next.

14

Corporation Finance and Joanne within the Division of

15

Trading and Markets work on the team that implemented the

16

rules that resulted in Regulation Crowdfunding.

17

But Julie within the Division of

And when I say this, I really mean it.

It was

18

a very challenging project for us at the staff.

19

one hand, it was complex because we were creating a brand

20

new exemption in the 33 Act.

21

TM with respect to the 34 Act, there's a whole new

22

framework for intermediaries that are registering as

23

funding portals.

24

We did benefit from a lot of comment in that area, which

25

was very helpful, and we are eager to see how it will

On the

But also our colleagues in

So it was a very challenging project.

Page 139
1

work out.

2

Just to give you an update on -- as you heard

3

this morning, the rules are not yet effective.

4

portals have been able to register starting in January

5

and the chair mentioned that we've already seen some of

6

them starting to submit the form to register with the

7

SEC.

8
9

Funding

For issuers, as it was noted, the rules will go
into effect on May 19th.

And although the issuers can't

10

currently file a form until that date, they will not be

11

able to file a form to actually do an offering.

12

open up the ability for issuers to test file, to have

13

access to what the form would look like and access the

14

system .

15

We did

We issued a press release on December 18th

16

providing information as to how an issuer would go

17

through the process of testing the Form C.

18

reason we did this was two-fold.

19

coming up with a new form that gets submitted via EDGAR.

20

And whenever you're dealing with a new form, there can

21

always be technical challenges.

22

we noted in the release and we were hoping is that as

23

people test the form to the extent that there were

24

problems with the form, they could let us know so that we

25

can address those before the effectiveness.

And the

On the one hand we are

And the one thing that

Page 140
1

The second reason for it is the scenario where

2

we are going to have issuers that are likely not familiar

3

with the process of filing something with the SEC.

4

the idea of opening it up for them to test the form, it

5

also gives them the ability to actually see what they're

6

going to have to go through and what the form looks like

7

so that when it comes May 16th, they are more informed as

8

to what the process will be like.

9

So

For any of those watching and interested in

10

this, the -- as I mentioned, the instructions are on a

11

press release on the Division of Corporation Finance

12

portion of the website as to how to do it.

13

unfortunately you have to move quick because we opened up

14

the testing December 18th, but it closes at the end of

15

this month in order to give us sufficient time to put in

16

place all of the changes that have been suggested to us

17

and fixes to the system.

18

And

So with that, I was going to turn to a quick

19

update on Rule 147 and 504.

20

bao9but both of those in the morning.

21

the Commission adopted final rules with respect to

22

Regulation Crowdfunding, the Commission proposed changes

23

to Rule 147 and 504.

24

about Rule 147, 504.

25

You heard quite a bit
The same day that

I know a lot of people have talked

Sometimes we -- here at the SEC, we run the

Page 141
1

risk of talking so much about rules and we don't actually

2

explain what they do.

3

rule that is -- as was mentioned this morning, was

4

adopted by the Commission in 1974, and it's a safe harbor

5

under Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act.

6

known as the intrastate exemption.

7

So in many ways, Rule 147 is a

And it's

The idea of Rule 147 in Section 3(a)(11), the

8

concept behind it is that if you are conducting an

9

offering, if you're an issuer in a specific -- doing

10

business in a specific state and you're conducting an

11

offering and selling -- both offering and selling only to

12

residents of that state, then you don't have to go

13

through a process at the federal level.

14

with the requirements at the state level itself.

15

You only comply

There is no limitation under the federal rules

16

as to how much an issuer can raise pursuant to Section

17

3(a)(11) or Rule 147.

18

there could be -- and many states, in fact, do have

19

requirements as to how much can be raised pursuant to the

20

intrastate exemption in that specific state.

21

Although, at the state level,

Rule 504, just very briefly, when people talk

22

about Regulation D, mostly people are focusing on 506(b)

23

and (c).

24

historically has been known as the seat capital

25

exemption.

Rule 504 is also part of Regulation D, as --

And currently it allows an issuer to raise up

Page 142
1

to $1 million over a 12-month period.

2

So why did the Commission propose amendments to

3

Rule 147 and Rule 504?

4

we've heard from other commenters, and we worked very

5

closely with Mike and his colleagues at NASAA.

6

we heard is that specifically with respect to Rule 147,

7

this concept of limiting both the offer and the sale to

8

residents of a particular state was somewhat outdated and

9

difficult to implement, especially in an internet age

We've heard from this committee,

And what

10

when you are trying to post your offering on the internet

11

and it's hard to limit how that offer is made only to

12

residents of a particular state, because as all of you

13

know the internet doesn't really know that you crossed

14

the boundary between one state and another.

15

So the -- these concerns led the -- and

16

additional developments in technology and communications

17

led us to believe that there was perhaps a need to

18

modernize that rule.

19

So what did the Commission specifically

20

propose?

21

exemption from registration that would be Rule 147.

22

Instead of being a safe harbor, it would now be a new

23

exemption under the Securities Act that would permit

24

offerings to take part with respect to any person so long

25

as the sales were limited to residents of the same state

The Commission proposed creating a new

Page 143
1

in which the issuer is doing business.

2

longer limiting the offer aspect of it, but like the

3

current intrastate exemption, you continue to limit those

4

who purchase to residents of the same state in which the

5

issue is doing business.

6

So you are no

The rule would also ease some of the other

7

requirements that exist in Rule 147 that would make it

8

available to a greater number of issuers to take

9

advantage of the rule.

10

The proposed amendments would limit the ability

11

of the new exemption to issuers that are either

12

registering the offering in state or issuers that are

13

making an offering under state law pursuant to an

14

exemption that limits the maximum amount that that issuer

15

could raise to no more than 5 million over a 12-month

16

period and that the state exemption also would have to

17

impose investment limitations, although it did not

18

mandate any specific investment limitations.

19

With respect to Rule 504, the proposal from the

20

Commission would raise the $1 million limit, which, by

21

the way, was set in 1988 and had not been changed since

22

then to $5 million and would also disqualify certain bad

23

actors for participating in Rule 504.

24

the aggregate offering amount would facilitate small

25

companies' ability to raise capital and also provide

The increase in

Page 144
1

greater flexibility for states to actually come up with

2

coordinated review programs, regional coordinated review

3

programs as the maximum amount that could be offered and

4

sold would increase from 1 million to 5 million.

5

actor disqualification is substantially similar to the

6

bad actor disqualification that applies to the other

7

portions of Regulation D.

8

create consistency across Reg D with respect to who are

9

the bad actors that are not able to participate.

10

The bad

So in many ways it would

The comment period ended January 12th, although

11

we always welcome comments.

12

after that date, we'll consider them of course.

13

Commission so far has received 26 comments on the

14

proposed amendments.

15

supportive of the changes that the Commission proposed,

16

including the amendments that would permit this broad

17

dissemination of offers so long as the purchasers are

18

residents of the same state as where the issuer is doing

19

business.

20

And if comments are received
The

And commenters generally were

However, many commenters did recommend that the

21

Commission did not replace the safe harbor in Rule 147

22

with this brand new exemption, but instead commenters

23

recommended that the Commission include the new exemption

24

in a separate rule and then retain but modernize to the

25

extent possible the safe harbor so that there would still

Page 145
1

be a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11).

2

The final thing that I just wanted to briefly

3

touch upon is the work that the staff has been doing on

4

the accredited investor definition.

5

the Commission to review the accredited investor

6

definition as it applies to natural persons.

7

White instructed the staff to prepare a report in

8

connection with the first review.

9

CorpFin and DERA worked on the report, although we did

Dodd-Frank required

And Chair

Staff primarily form

10

get help from a lot of the other offices and divisions of

11

the SEC.

12

December 18th that is available on our website.

13

And the Commission published a report on

As many of you know and you've heard so far,

14

the accredited investor definition is a keystone of

15

Regulation D.

16

definition relies on two types of thresholds.

17

And when it comes to natural persons, the

Accredited investors under the current rules

18

would be an individual who has an income of more than

19

$200,000 over the last two years and an expectation that

20

they will have an income would exceed that threshold in

21

the current year.

22

are pooling their income with their spouse, it has to be

23

a joint income that exceeds $300,000.

24
25

And with respect to individuals who

The other threshold that is used to qualify as
an accredited investor would be for individuals that have

Page 146
1

a net worth, excluding their primary residence, of more

2

than $1 million.

3

The thresholds were primarily set in 1982.

The

4

200,000 and the $1 million.

5

threshold came in in 1988, and the taking out the primary

6

residence happened in 2011.

7

about the accredited investor thresholds and the

8

accredited investor definition because they have not been

9

updated for inflation since the 1980s.

The 300,000 joint income

There's been a lot of talk

The 200,000 would

10

be approximately 500,000 today, the 300,000 approximately

11

600,000, and the $1 million approximately $2.5 million

12

today.

13

So the staff put together this report that

14

considers a number of recommendations that have received

15

-- they've received recommendations from this committee,

16

they've received recommendations from the Investor

17

Advisory Committee, and they had already received a lot

18

of public comment with respect to the definition itself.

19

So the report not only provides

20

recommendations, but it also sets forth an analysis of

21

what the impact that those recommendations could have on

22

the accredited investor pool.

23

And so to give you a flavor for what the staff

24

recommended, the staff recommended that the Commission

25

could leave the current income and net worth thresholds

Page 147
1

as they are now in place, but subject them to -- those

2

investors to a 10 percent limitation.

3

would be that the amount that an investor could invest in

4

any one issuer would be limited, but investors at the

5

current thresholds would be able to continue to qualify

6

as accredited investors.

7

The idea here

The staff also recommended creating a new

8

inflation adjusted threshold that would not be subject to

9

this investment limitation, for example a 10 percent

10

limitation.

11

what the adjusted for inflation numbers would be, around

12

$500,000 for individuals, rounding up about $750,000 for

13

joint income and $2.5 million for net worth.

14

And it could be something along the lines of

The staff also recommended additional ways that

15

the Commission could consider for individuals to qualify

16

as accredited investors that are currently not part of

17

the definition.

18

many commenters have suggested that they would be

19

supportive of a minimum amount of investments thresholds.

20

So once investors have indicated that they have invested

To give you an idea of some of those,

21

more than a certain amount, then those individuals would

22

qualify as accredited investors even if their net worth

23

or their income doesn't meet the thresholds.

24
25

The staff also recommended considering
professional credentials to qualify as accredited

Page 148
1

investors.

2

or the Series 65 or the Series 82 examinations, perhaps

3

those examinations could be evidence of investor

4

sophistication because of the subject matter that those

5

examinations cover.

6

So for example if you've taken the Series 7

The staff also recommended looking at

7

potentially investor experience.

8

previously participated in 10 prior private securities

9

offerings with respect to different issuers, perhaps that

10

individual has presumably developed the knowledge and has

11

done the due diligence and understand valuations, things

12

that they've learned through the process of investing in

13

those 10 prior offerings.

14

So if an investor had

The staff also considered including

15

knowledgeable employees of private funds that would

16

qualify as accredited investors with respect to the

17

investments in those employer funds.

18

that these employees would have significant investing

19

experience or would have sufficient access to the

20

information since they are working for the funds in which

21

they're actually investing in.

22

The idea there is

And then finally the last thing I was going to

23

mention -- and the report goes through a number of

24

suggestions also with respect to non-natural persons, as

25

to how the Commission could expand the definition or

Page 149
1

revise the definition.

2

mention is there's a lot of talk about the possibility of

3

an accredited investor examination and the staff

4

recommended that the Commission could explore the

5

possibility of designing such an accredited investor

6

examination.

7

enable financially sophisticated individuals to qualify

8

as accredited investors regardless of their wealth or

9

education by actually proactively demonstrating that they

But the last thing I wanted to

The idea of this approach would be to

10

can pass an examination that in many ways would look at

11

their sophistication when it comes to investing in

12

private offerings.

13

So the last thing I leave you with is what

14

would be the impact of some of these recommendations.

15

the Commission were to only adjust for inflation, the

16

current thresholds, the current pool of the population

17

that qualifies as accredited investor is approximately

18

10.1 percent, and that pool will go down to approximately

19

3.6 percent.

20

If

If, on the other hand, the Commission were to

21

adjust for inflation but also come up with new threshold

22

levels -- I mean retain the current threshold levels but

23

impose a 10 percent limitation plus also come up with an

24

investments test, in essence the idea of if you have a

25

certain amount of investments, then you would be able to

Page 150
1

qualify as an accredited investor, our calculation from

2

our colleagues in DERA will show that the current pool of

3

10.1 percent would go up to about 11.5 percent.

4

What these figures don't account for is all the

5

other recommendations that in many ways are not

6

quantifiable to us because a lot of those tests that look

7

at other measures of sophistication, we expect that they

8

would only increase the size of the pool, but we don't

9

have data to quantify how much by how much they would

10

increase the size of the pool.

11

So I've already taken a lot of your time.

12

Joanne, I don't know if you wanted to say

13
14

anything about finders and -MS. RUTKOWSKI:

I guess it's no news is good

15

news on finders.

16

Sebastian talk about crowdfunding.

17

we always have this tension in the broker-dealer space

18

because the scope of the definition is so broad, and

19

there's so many different types of limited purpose

20

broker-dealers.

21

we've been studying and we're trying to develop

22

approaches.

It's really -- I was listening to
It reminded me about

And that certainly is something that

23

But at the same time, broker-dealers,

24

intermediaries, folks who are playing with other people's

25

money play an important role as gatekeepers.

I mean even

Page 151
1

funding portals in the final rule have a safe harbor that

2

allows them to determine whether and under what

3

conditions to admit -- I'm sorry, issuers to their

4

platform.

5

So it's a serious endeavor, it's a balancing

6

act, there are some no action letters out there.

We did

They had to revisit the rule book.

I know they have out

11

for comment with us the capital acquisition brokers.

12

there's a March deadline on that.

13
14

So I guess the short answer is the staff is
continuing to study, but it's not an easy answer.

15
16

MR. GRAHAM:

Is there any thought of interim

steps?

17
18

And

MS. RUTKOWSKI:

I think we're open to the full

range of possibilities.

19

MR. YADLEY:

Hi, Joanne.

I'm usually the voice

20

of reason.

21

weren't hear this morning.

22

There are no easy answers, but I think this committee

23

made recommendations last time and we did have a whole

24

range of ideas to think about.

25

the finish line and there may be differences of viewpoint

And I totally agree with what you said.

You

We touched on this briefly.

While we may not get to

Page 152
1

on this committee, within the staff, at the Commission

2

level, it really doesn't seem to us that we shouldn't do

3

something and propose.

4

wouldn't reveal more nuances, but since the ABA taskforce

5

report in 2005, I think we've pretty much identified 90-

6

plus percent of the issues.

7

Because not that more study

And so just speaking as a member of the

8

committee, I hope that we will move from the study phase

9

to a proposal stage and I think the chairs and the rest

10

of my fellow committee members can weigh in, but I think

11

we are very willing to be a part of that process and be

12

helpful, and our prior recommendations sort of set the

13

table for not just studying but making some

14

recommendations, and I hope you will.

15
16

MS. RUTKOWSKI:

Thanks, Greg.

I appreciate it,

and I will take the message back.

17

MR. REARDON:

18

I have small clients.

I deal with this issue regularly.
And it's very difficult when

19

somebody shows up with a -- to your client and says I can

23

she cannot deliver and in addition is going to get them

24

in trouble for violating the law.

out there that are stealing from small business people or

wasting their time, and it needs to be dealt with.

no more study is needed.

And somebody, either

MS. HANKS:

And there are a lot of crooks

But

If I could just add to that one

10

again and just to build on what Greg was saying, in

11

addition to -- since the taskforce stuff came out, I mean

12

we now have the whole online capital formation platforms,

13

and I'm seeing all the time the guys who are trying to

14

comply with the law are at a disadvantage with the guys,

15

and it's really not fair to them.

16

There are some platforms out there totally

don't need any stinking no action letters.

they've got a problem.

too, the guys who are saying, well, I went out and I had

3

to study for the Series 7 and it took me a while, but now

4

I've done it.

5
6

And the good guys have a problem,

So it's a matter of equity.

MS. RUTKOWSKI:

I very much appreciate

everything you're saying and I will take it back.

7

MR. GRAHAM:

Any other comments on finders

8

versus brokers?

9

very complete, that -- I don't know what more we could

I do think that our recommendation was

10

say, but I think if I remember right, in our

11

recommendation we did talk about the possibility of

12

taking interim steps, understanding that there -- I mean

13

we're here to try to find ways to facilitate capital

14

formation by small businesses.

15

And I don't know the extent it would help, but

16

intuitively you just have to feel that coming up with a

17

rule that's going to enable the people with the rolodex

18

and not receive transaction-based compensation and all

19

the rest would go a long way toward it helping with the

20

situation that we talked about this morning in terms of

21

trying to let -- trying to educate small businesses as to

22

how they can go about and access capital and educate them

23

and who they might go to.

24

study just for that, and I'm only being partially

25

facetious.

I think maybe we need another

Page 156
1

I think the important point is that we should

2

be able to do something and I'm fairly confident that

3

even though it might appear to be small that it might

4

prove to be significant.

5

The accredited investor definition, has

6

everybody seen the report?

7

seen it, you should download it or just put it on your

8

screen and take a look.

9

things that we should do as a committee is take a good

You should -- if you haven't

Yeah, I think that one of the

10

look at that report and see to what extent there may be

11

other suggestions that we might want to give in addition

12

to the recommendation that we provided last term.

13

And I know that our member, Patrick, has

14

submitted a letter for one and I think that it probably

15

would make sense for us as a committee to take a look at

16

that report and take the opportunity to weigh in.

17

Do you have anything else?

18

MS. MOTT:

19

MR. GRAHAM:

20

MS. MOTT:

Stephen?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

I was hoping we would

21

address this.

22

Capital Association, the public policy committee is about

23

to submit a letter as well.

24

for us to address because it can have a significant

25

impact on the amount of capital -- seed capital that's

So thank you.

And I know that the Angel

I do think this is important

Page 157
1

available for companies to get off the ground.

2

critically important.

3

your numbers I think are pretty close to the impact that

4

it's going to have on the pool of investors.

5

important for us to address.

6
7

MR. NELSON:

So

I just want to emphasize it is --

So

Thanks.

Just two comments.

One is could

we actually have that report emailed to us?

8

MR. GOMEZ:

9

MR. NELSON:

Yes, we'll do that.
I'd also just be interested in

10

getting kind of a gut feel from the other members of the

11

committee whether they feel that more -- looser standards

12

or stricter standards need to actually be created?

13

need more investments into small businesses and loosening

14

the pool of available capital or because do we need to

15

actually tighten up because of instances of fraud and

16

that sort of stuff?

17

I'd be just curious to see where everybody else

18

is.

19

time, so the more capital is available to them, the

20

better.

21

just outright fraud.

22

Do we

I have -- I hang out with entrepreneurs all the

I've seen in maybe 10 years two instances of

MR. GRAHAM:

But that's just me.
Yeah, well, it's -- I'll let other

23

people respond.

24

core issue that we're dealing with, if you will, is

25

removing the barriers to capital formation for small

But again, we're faced -- kind of the

Page 158
1

business.

2

issue and formulated a recommendation, our sense was kind

3

of just that as far as the points that you're making, and

4

that is that we're dealing with a system that currently

5

works.

6

somewhere between a trillion and two million and two

7

trillion I guess and as far as magnitude of the market if

8

you will.

And certainly when this committee took up the

I don't know what the numbers are.

MR. NELSON:

Could I just interject right

there?

capital.

13

paper.

14

166 billion.

15

It's

What I saw in the report when I read it last
That was funds and all private

But small business was 166 billion of that
I could be wrong, but that's what I saw was only

MR. GRAHAM:

That could be.

Anyway, it's --

16

however you want to kind of define small business, just

17

kind of looking at the private placement market, it's

18

big.

19

506, and I guess in today's lingo, Rule 506(b).

20

you've -- you have a market, it's clearly substantial,

21

it's clearly important from the standpoint of our economy

22

and job creation and all the rest.

23

that?

24

-- intuitively you would think would hurt that market and

25

hurt the -- and reduce the amount of capital that's

And that is -- we all know that that is written by
And so

And so why constrict

Why come up with a set of rules that are going to

Well, one way might be the existence as fraud

as you suggest.

4

have to keep in mind is investor protection.

5

of understand that.

6

that relates to fraud that can somehow be tied back to

7

those thresholds.

8
9

And certainly one of the things that we
We all kind

But I'm not really aware of an issue

MS. HANKS:

I think that's true.

If we look at

what happened in the presentations to this committee last

10

session where we did have some presentations on the

11

existence of fraud.

12

market sometimes, but it is not driven by where the

13

definition of accredited investor is, and nobody's been

14

able to come up with any evidence that that was the case.

15

Yes, there is fraud in the private

MS. TIERNEY:

I think I'd also note the last

16

time that the definition of accredited investor was

17

amended was Dodd Frank.

18

residence was backed out of the equation of net worth,

19

and that decreased the pool of people who could invest I

20

think at that point from like 9 percent to 7 percent.

21

And that had a big impact on the market just then.

And the investor's primary

22

The idea of increasing dollar thresholds in a

23

market where there's no real investor protection issues

24

that anyone can point to with specificity, potentially

25

decrease it to 3.6 just because there's a construct that

Page 160
1

things should have been adjusted for inflation makes no

2

sense.

3

especially people who are retail investors and not even

4

accredited investors who get so unhappy that they can't

5

invest in the private company space in 506 already, it

6

just doesn't make sense to go to a more restrictive

7

definition.

8
9

And I think that everything that we see,

MR. GRAHAM:

And that's also assuming that the

initial numbers were --

10

MS. TIERNEY:

11

MR. GRAHAM: -- too high.

12

too low or something.

Agree.
I mean maybe -- or

It assumes that they were correct.

13

MS. TIERNEY:

14

MR. GRAHAM:

15

MR. HAUPTMAN:

I'd like to see the numbers drop.
There's two.
Just to Jonathan's question, I

16

know we're not having a poll here, but that would be

17

three votes here for reducing the standard.

18

percent convinced that on the whole having an accredited

19

investor standard is useful to begin with provided all

20

parties agree that those who engage in fraudulent

21

activity should have the book thrown at them.

22

investor standard does not exist in other countries, and

23

things still work out over there as well, other places.

24
25

I'm not 100

Accredited

And to protect the investor, protect from
fraud, fair enough.

Again, that's a prosecution's war.

Page 161
1

But I would expand the definition of protection.

2

you can help protect me is by letting me invest in a

3

company as I'd like to.

4

MR. GRAHAM:

5

MS. MOTT:

The way

Catherine.
one of the things I want to add for

6

the committee is that when the Angel Capital Association

7

looked at how this is going to impact the angel groups in

8

the United States, it really impacted the middle part of

9

America.

It didn't impact LA, it didn't impact Boston or

10

New York.

11

250,000 in Cincinnati, Ohio or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

12

whatever.

13

angel group as surgeons who make 300, 350, but if they

14

were living in New York, they would be making 500.

Because 500,000 in New York is like making

I mean I look at the composite of our local

15

So the decrease is --

16

(Interruption to proceeding.)

17

But anyways, it's really -- the economic impact

18

of middle America is going to feel it the most, and

19

that's where it's going to hurt the most.

20

MR. GOMEZ:

So --

I just wanted to point out and be

21

clear when I gave the numbers the only adjusting the

22

numbers for inflation actually is not a recommendation in

23

the staff study.

24

about it that I wanted to throw that number out there.

25

The 11.-some percent would be the number if you were to

But there's been enough discussion

Page 162
1

actually do all of the staff recommendations.

2

were to only impose a 10 percent limitation, granted the

3

pool would stay the same.

4

If you

Where a -- I don't know, Catherine, based on

5

your membership, as to whether if you're limiting how

6

much someone can invest by 10 percent, whether that would

7

actually cut the dollar amount or not.

8

that's an interesting question.

9

MS. MOTT:

I mean I think

Actually we go through an

10

orientation program with our investors, and we actually

11

recommend that they limit 5 to 10 percent of their net

12

worth.

13

several different companies because it's a risky asset

14

class.

So minimum 10, but we encourage you to go to 18

15

to 25.

And actually the data shows -- well, from some of

16

the studies out there, there's still a minimal amount of

17

data out there in the studies.

But we also encourage them to spread it across

18

Once you get up to 36 percent, you even have a

19

better chance of -- but it's -- so we do encourage that,

20

to limit it to that.

21

them not to include their residence, even prior to it

22

being promulgated.

23

hear you, but I'm just -- I get nervous when I see the

24

number 500,000, but -- who will be impacted, so --

25

So -- and we've always encouraged

So I mean it's just -- so, yeah, I

MR. GRAHAM:

So isn't -- I don't know where I

Page 163
1

come out on this exactly, but isn't it kind of

2

paternalistic to tell people how much they can invest or

3

not?

4

business of doing?

5
6
7

And is that really what we should be in the

MS. MOTT:

Yeah, we don't tell them.

We advise

them.
MS. HANKS:

I would say anyone who's been

8

through the Angel Capital Association training program

9

should automatically be admitted as an accredited

10

investor because --

11

MR. GRAHAM:

Good point.

12

MR. YADLEY:

And I guess that's one of the

13

things, getting beyond the inflation adjustments and the

14

numbers, the other thing -- and I think the staff and the

15

staff study are terrific because we all agree that the

16

number, whatever it is, $200,000 a year, a million

17

dollars net worth is just a number.

18

out, it really hasn't been a problem for decades, so --

19

but okay, we can quibble about whether that number should

20

be adjusted.

21

As Steve pointed

But beyond that, the other ideas for expanding

22

the pool makes perfect sense because we all know that

23

those numbers are just a proxy for people who need less

24

protection than other people.

25

credentials and background and experience investing or

So people that have

Page 164
1

through their education or jobs, I think, again, that's a

2

great way to allow them to be part of America's culture

3

of capitalism and democracy.

4
5

And we should promote that.

And by the way, it will lead to job creation, which
we're all in favor of.

6

MR. GRAHAM:

7

MR. HAUPTMAN:

Kyle.
For all the talk of inequality

8

that we hear about these days, it would seem odd to me to

9

have our official policy be that the best investment

10

opportunities are limited by law to the 1 percent.

11

they can get the top investment opportunities.

12

of the ways that one becomes the 1 percent is via

13

entrepreneurship, which we are also making more difficult

14

for them to do.

Only

And one

15

We're trying to protect this club -- we're not

16

trying to, but this could be the effect -- protect the 1

17

percent.

18

opportunities, and number two, no one will be clamoring -

19

- fewer people will be clamoring to join you in that

20

group because their startup idea we're making harder to

21

fund.

22

Number one, you get the investment

MR. GUTIERREZ:

I'd like to make a comment.

23

often say that the issue is not access to capital, but

24

the issue is because there's quite a bit of capital out

25

there.

And so I look at it from the perspective of the

I

Page 165
1

small business owners.

2

regime and we are creating a platform whereby we're

3

limiting the capital that exists out there, the ones who

4

are really going to be impacted are going to be those

5

business owners.

6

-- this conversation as you've pointed out, Steve, is

7

about capital formation opportunities.

8

limiting opportunities I feel is really going against

9

that basic tenet.

10

Right?

And if we are creating a

So I'd like to change the framework of

And for us to be

The second point I wanted to make is I think

11

dovetailing on something that Kyle mentioned, which is I

12

do believe there's a dubious connection between someone's

13

net worth and their financial sophistication.

14

plenty of folks who are financially very successful who

15

quite frankly would be considered unsophisticated

16

investors, and I think it would be a shame if we begin to

17

limit those who are allowed to put their money wherever

18

they'd like to based on what they've already accomplished

19

financially.

I know

20

MR. GRAHAM:

Thanks.

21

MR. NELSON:

One of the things that I'm also

Jonathan.

22

sensitive to is having been in kind of public service

23

roles before, when you get it right, no one knows, but if

24

you get it wrong, you're in the newspaper sitting in

25

front of Congress.

And that's an awful job.

And I thank

Page 166
1

you guys for your service, because it's amazing what you

2

guys are attempting to do, which is prevent all of

3

America from fraud and create markets.

4

But I think on this side of the table not being

5

the public servant but someone kind of being out there in

6

industry, I would like to think as a committee how do we

7

communicate very, very strongly that I, for instance,

8

want much more access to capital, and I very much want

9

not to protect investors from themselves, but to truly

10

protect them from fraud.

11

things, the lines to be drawn.

12
13

These are my opinions and not necessarily those
of the SEC.

14
15

Those are where we want the

MR. GRAHAM:

Well, thank you for that,

Jonathan.

16

Can we move on now?

Okay.

So at this time I'd

17

like to ask Annemarie to -- with your discussion on what

18

the advisory committee recommended last term with respect

19

to 4(a)(1 1/2) and its codification into 4(a)(7).

20

all yours.

21

MS. TIERNEY:

It's

Well, I had the honor of

22

presenting this committee last March, almost a year ago,

23

about what we saw was a market need to create a new

24

exemption in the private company space for resales of

25

securities, which was a codification of a legal construct

Page 167
1

that's referred to as 4(a)(1 1/2).

2

there was a bill in Congress that created a new federal

3

exemption.

And at that point

4

That bill was signed into law by the President

5

on December 4th of last year, and it basically creates a

6

new safe harbor for resales of private securities.

7

Buyers have to be accredited, and there can't be general

8

solicitation.

9

There is information requirements, so the

10

exemption is only available to a seller if an issuer

11

consents to provide certain information, including two

12

years of financial statements prepared in accordance with

13

U.S. GAAP or IFRS if it's a foreign company.

14

about the company's business, names of their officers and

15

directors, some kind of routine things like the name of

16

the issuer, which I don't think is a problem for most

17

companies, their address, title and class.

18

Information

The nice thing about the exemption is it gets

19

rid of a lot of noise around 4(a)(1 1/2) that existed in

20

the space where Steve and I and many of you operate,

21

which is private company, kind of later-stage private

22

companies that have a significant employee or former

23

employee base who have trouble getting value for their

24

equity unless they can locate a buyer, sell the

25

underlying common stock to fund the exercise of the

Page 168
1

options and the income tax consequences.

2

And what we were seeing was a mixed bag of

3

opinions from different law firms that we were working

4

with where some law firms were very comfortable if

5

somebody used the proceeds of the underlying -- sale of

6

the underlying common to cover the cost.

7

Some were not comfortable with that, so we were

8

seeing some companies requiring their employees to sign

9

promissory notes or give checks to the company in order

10

to participate in the liquidity program where the options

11

were being exercised.

12

around the space.

13

So there's just a lot of noise

The other thing about 4(a)(1 1/2), since it's a

14

legal construct, it's not actually a safe harbor in the

15

rules.

16

law, so as an intermediary in the private company space,

17

it was virtually impossible for us as a broker-dealer to

18

help locate buy-side interest.

19

It wasn't -- resales were not preempt under state

The state law that deals with broker-dealers

20

says that the bid has to be unsolicited, which is the

21

flip from the primary space where if you're a broker-

22

dealer and you have a preexisting relationship with your

23

clients, you can market primary opportunities as long as

24

the investment is suitable to them.

25

space, you can't market opportunities at all.

In the secondary
And that

Page 169
1

just didn't make any sense to us.

2

that problem as well by creating preemption.

3

So 4(a)(7) gets rid of

Securities still under 4(a)(7) are covered

4

securities.

5

shareholders and employees of private companies to allow

6

them to get liquidity for their shares to the extent that

7

the company is willing to provide the information.

8

we're really excited about it.

9

And so it's just another tool in the box of

So

You don't have to hear me talking about the

10

need to codify 4(a)(1 1/2) which you've been hearing for

11

three years-plus.

12

Sebastian and all of the people at the SEC as well.

13
14
15

So I'm sure this is very exciting to

MR. GRAHAM:

Do you have a sense of the impact

it's going to have on secondary market liquidity?
MS. TIERNEY:

One thing that we thought would

16

be really interesting -- and we're going to put this out

17

in the next week or so -- was we did a review of all of

18

the secondary liquidity programs that we'd done over the

19

past two years, and we looked at the information that

20

issuers provided to participants in our market to get a

21

sense of where there might be friction points that might

22

be uncomfortable.

23

What we found that was in about -- I think the

24

number is 74 percent of the cases -- 74 percent of the

25

transactions that we did, U.S. GAAP financials were

Page 170
1

provided.

2

happy with that.

3

didn't have U.S. GAAP financials.

4

financial statements.

5

of GAAP financial statements.

6

That was a good percentage.

We were pretty

Some of the companies that we work with
They just provided

But 74 percent provided two years

Another requirement is that if the balance

7

sheet is more than six months old, you have to provide

8

interim financial statements.

9

think 38 percent of the transactions that we did,

That we saw less of, I

10

included interims.

11

Stephen, he probably knows better than I, but I just

12

don't think the market put that much emphasis on

13

interims, and companies didn't really consider them to be

14

that material because they were growing so fast or they

15

were expanding in different ways.

16

that we felt was interesting.

And I think the market -- and

So that's something

17

So I think that what's going to happen is that

18

to the extent a company is sponsoring a liquidity event,

19

they're either allowing their shareholders to transfer

20

securities to a buyer and they've got a good relationship

21

with the seller or they've engaged a platform or some

22

kind, NASDAQ, private market, whomever to actually

23

facilitate the liquidity program.

24

become the exemption of choice because it clears out all

25

the noise around the opinion practice and also the cost

4(a)(7) is going to

Page 171
1

of the exercise.

2

to provide information, 4(a)(7) also makes it very clear

3

that it's a non-exclusive safe harbor.

4

construct still exists as currently applied.

5

have two options.

6

To the extent the issuer is not willing

So 4(a)(1 1/2)
So now you

The only other exemption that we really see

7

utilized our in our space is Rule 144.

8

private company space, that means you have to hold the

9

stock for 12 months, and it doesn't include tacking

And in the

10

period for holding options in most cases.

11

the people that we work with, the shareholders that we

12

work with, they can't satisfy 144.

13

an excellent choice for them and 4(a)(1 1/2) still

14

operates to give them more choices.

15

MR. GRAHAM:

So for most of

So, again, 4(a)(7) is

Do you see from -- do you see the

16

potential for friction in the -- kind of in the new

17

4(a)(7) rule related to the information requirement and

18

the potential liability of issuers?

19

MS. TIERNEY:

I've heard that question a bit.

20

I would think that to the extent that an issuer is

21

providing disclosure, it has -- in the context of the

22

exemption, the information is to be provided to sellers

23

and buyers.

24

information.

25

information, it has liability already under the

I don't think there's an increased level of
If a company is providing fraudulent

Page 172
1

securities laws.

2

degree of liability.

3

option if they want to provide the information.

4

So I don't think there's a greater

MR. GRAHAM:

And again, it's the company's

Is there anything else that you

5

think we need to do as a committee to bring additional

6

clarification to anything?

7

MS. TIERNEY:

There are some -- I think the

8

part that's tricky is that the exemption's built into the

9

statute, not into a rule.

So the staff doesn't have the

10

ability to actually make changes themselves I don't

11

think.

12

Congress on some technical amendments that we think would

13

be helpful where there's terminology used that's not

14

specific to the securities laws.

15

So we are actually working with some members of

So it that goes forward, I'm sure I would come

16

back to the committee and sort of let you know what we're

17

doing and potentially get a recommendation, if you all

18

agree, to support a technical amendment.

19

And one of the things that took us by surprise

20

was the change of the information requirement to

21

something that the purchaser can wave which was in an

22

earlier version of the bill to the actual requirement

23

that it be provided.

24

through that concept as well.

25

MR. GRAHAM:

So we think we're still working

Okay.

We were supposed to spend a

Page 173
1

moment or two on what's happening on the congressional

2

side of things, and I skipped over that.

3

Sara.

4

MS. HANKS:

Because it's less interesting, I

5

think, than what Annemarie was talking about.

6

with respect to the 4(a)(7) changes, which I think were

7

good as far as they go, it's not the answer to -- it's

8

not the liquidity answer that we're looking for yet.

9

There is other stuff that needs to be done.

One thing

I mean one

10

of the things that 4(a)(7) answers is the ability when

11

you are doing a resale to an accredited investor, you can

12

now not have to bother with state regulations, and that's

13

nice.

14

securities that are going to be traded, and that does not

15

yet exist.

16

But we need that for all of the private market

So I'm going to totally gallop through a few of

17

the congressional initiatives that are out there just to

18

make sure that everyone knows what's out there and who

19

knows whether any of these will ever go anywhere in that

20

we are now just a few days away from Super Tuesday.

21

who knows whether this will go anywhere.

22

So

There's been a lot of interest in Congress in

23

making changes to the securities laws for fostering

24

capital formation over the course of the last few years.

25

The JOBS Act, of course, and all of the various

Page 174
1

initiatives that were gathered into the JOBS Act is one

2

of the best examples of that, but this is a continuing

3

process.

4

congress at the moment that could eventually end up being

5

JOBS Act 2.0, 3.0, whatever you want to call it this

6

week.

7

And there's a few bills floating around

On February 1st, the House passed with

8

overwhelming bipartisan support a bill that would amend

9

the definition of accredited investor in Section 2(a)(15)

10

of the Securities Act, which relates to Section 4(a)(5)

11

of the Securities Act, which is an exemption that I did

12

not mention this morning because it doesn't get used.

13

The staff would never be able to say this, but it's an

14

identical definition for an unused exemption that is

15

identical to the one that does get used in Regulation D.

16

I am assuming -- and the staff does not have to

17

answer this, of course, that the staff would likely, as

18

they have done in the past, change both definitions in

19

tandem, because that would be the logical thing to do,

20

and I don't think they have any prohibition on that.

21

What the definition would do is some of the

22

things we've just been talking about:

23

worth and income thresholds, include persons who the SEC

24

determines by regulation to have demonstrable educational

25

job experience to qualify such persons of having

codify current net

Page 175
1

professional knowledge of a subject related to a

2

particular investment such that they're allowed to be

3

accredited investors.

4

this.

5

And the SEC, of course, can expand

There is another set of bills that would

6

establish the Office of the Advocate for Small Business

7

Capital Formation, which would, in effect, take --

8

probably take this committee and make it a statutory

9

committee, appoint an advocate for the business sort of

10

parallel to the current investor advocate, which is a

11

separate office within the Commission and also require

12

the Commission to respond formally to the recommendations

13

made in the annual meeting every year that the -- I

14

forget what it's called now, but the Small Business Forum

15

is the short name.

16

Anyone watching who isn't aware of this, this

17

happens usually the week before Thanksgiving every year,

18

and it's a really entertaining and democratic process

19

where a lot of people other than the usual talking heads

20

can be heard by the Commission.

21

webcast and that's -- all that the afternoon breakout

22

sessions are usually broadcast by phone, and so people

23

should participate wherever they are.

24
25

So, everyone, that is

Also, February, the House passed a package of
bills titled:

The Capital Markets Improvement Act of

Page 176
1

2015.

2

changes to Rule 701, which is an exemption for securities

3

issued to compensatory benefit plans, E swaps, which

4

would increase the level at which a written plan has to

5

be disclosed.

6

broker exemption that we talked about earlier, the

7

exemption that the SEC has issued by no action letter to

8

certain people acting as M&A brokers or business finders

9

put that into law.

10

It's got a number of different elements, including

There's -- it would also include the M&A

It's fine as far as it goes, but it's

already in the no action.

11

It would -- the collection of bills would also

12

exempt emerging market -- emerging growth companies from

13

having to use XBRL, which is the tagging system whereby

14

you say this is our net revenues, and it's always -- so

15

that somebody who searched doing machine searching of

16

filings could compare apples to apples in a company's

17

accounts.

18

to do in some circumstances.

19

reduced, and there's also a proposal that the SEC be

20

directed to draft a rule providing a safe harbor for

21

covered investment fund research reports.

22

It's a useful idea, but it is very difficult
So that burden would be

Whether any of these are going to go anywhere

23

is debatable.

24

respect to that last collection that I mentioned.

25

I said, we're a few days away from Super Tuesday, so who

A veto threat is a possibility with
And as

Page 177

knows.

2

MR. GRAHAM:

3

Well, again, one of the questions that we have

Nice wrap-up.

Thank you.

4

to keep asking ourselves is:

5

efficient capital formation for small business?

6

mentioned earlier, in terms of useful rulemaking and

7

policy, I think that three things that seem most

8

important to me, and that's liquidity, complexity and

9

certainty.

10

What is in the way of
As I

I think in terms of liquidity, no one is going

11

to get into something if they can't get out of it.

12

terms of complexity, rules that should take you to a good

13

place are -- it's a nice idea.

14

that they -- as to be not useful, then of course they

15

become not useful.

16

make sure that the whatever rules that we have out there,

17

there's some degree of certainty associated with it.

18

In

But if they're so complex

Certainty is the other one.

It's --

I think that's one reason why -- I mean I don't

19

know, but I think that's probably one reason 506(c) is

20

slow on the uptake because of all of the uncertainty that

21

kind of surrounded verification.

22

be settling down a bit, but we'll see what the future

23

holds.

24

that probably are worth following up on.

25

of accredited investor, no need to say anything more at

I guess that seems to

But I think we've talked about a few things today
The definition

Page 178
1

this time, but I reiterate that everyone should get a

2

copy of the report and read it and let's start exchanging

3

ideas.

4

The -- we talked about, again, the issue with

5

finders versus brokers.

6

think that that's important, and I think many of us think

7

that small steps could be taken that could have a

8

noticeable impact.

That's -- I think many of us

9

The whole issue with respect to one-size-fits-

10

all in the markets, that's one that I think continues to

11

be significant.

12

there's still I think work to be done in order to find a

13

way to structure markets so they're more conducive or

14

more friendly to smaller public companies.

15

I think people understand that fact, but

And then of course we talked about outreach.

16

think that's something that we haven't focused on, I

17

think sufficiently.

18

think of outreach, you tend to think in terms of trying

19

to educate the companies, trying to educate the issuers.

20

And again, whenever -- when you

But I think this may include also educating capital

21

sources and maybe thinking in terms of partnering with

22

industry groups.

23

There's much work to be done, and as in most

24

cases, we have to be careful not to let perfection be

25

kind of the enemy of the very good.

And so I think that

I

Page 179
1

hopefully we can begin to take some incremental steps

2

that will have a real impact.

3

give everybody an opportunity to give some of their ideas

4

before I wrap things up.

5

So, Catherine.

6

MS. MOTT:

And with that, I wanted to

Thank you, Stephen.

Stephen and

7

Sara, could we possibly review the definition of general

8

solicitation?

9

and I think that's why you see more 506(b) offerings than

Here's my thoughts about that is that --

10

you do (c).

11

call demo days, venture fair, pitch competitions as not

12

general solicitation.

13

If we could, carve out demo days or what we

I think that a lot of attorneys are saying to

14

their clients, look, when you go to these demo days,

15

don't talk about raising money; just talk about what your

16

company does because you're going to cross that threshold

17

that means you have to file 506(c), and you can't go back

18

and file for 506(b) once you go down that path.

19

And so what that then does is then the whole

20

venture community says, well, forget it, I don't want --

21

look at this company now.

22

could simplify that definition so that we understand it

23

so that the issuers understand how they play in the

24

marketplace.

25

MR. GRAHAM:

So I think we have some -- we

Thank you.

Page 180
1

Sebastian, I can't call up those CDIs.

2

MR. GOMEZ:

Is --

Catherine and Steve, I think that's

3

a good topic to touch upon.

4

definition of what general solicitation is.

5

has been getting a lot of questions or had been getting a

6

lot of questions as to what constitutes or doesn't

7

constitute.

8

of CDIs.

9

There is no black and white
The staff

The staff provided some guidance in the form

There was also no action letter that the staff

10

issued last year providing some insight on that.

11

think if the committee desires to do so, that might be an

12

interesting topic where we could get someone from the

13

staff to present to the committee as to what the staff

14

has done with respect to interpretive guidance and no

15

action letters.

16

MR. GRAHAM:

But I

So this might be another situation

17

where we're moving the ball forward, but maybe we're at

18

the 50-yard line in terms of having sufficient certainty?

19

MR. GOMEZ:

20

MR. GRAHAM:

21

MR. GOMEZ: -- goal line is.

22

I just -- I'm not sure where the -30-yard line?
And I think if you

ask different people --

23

MR. GRAHAM:

24

MR. GOMEZ: -- where the goal line is, I think

25

15-yard line?

people would have different ideas.

And in part it's

Page 181
1

because general solicitation is not black and white, and

2

it's facts and circumstances.

3

staff was trying to do was provide some guidance as to

4

the things that may be and may not be general

5

solicitation.

6

So in many ways what the

It used to be that about 20 years ago there was

7

quite a lot of no action guidance in this area, and then

8

in many ways what the staff did is go back and look at

9

that no action guidance in the form of CDIs.

And the new

10

letter that the staff provided in essence update, bring

11

forward that guidance.

12

In some respects it did not change from what

13

was before, and in some other respects there was what

14

some may view as potential expansion as to what had been

15

done before.

16

the committee to hear from the staff and then the

17

committee can always decide whether we are on the 50-yard

18

line or whether we are almost at the touchdown.

So it might be a topic that is worth for

19

MR. GRAHAM:

All right.

20

MR. YADLEY:

I think that's a great idea.

I

21

was yesterday talking with a British friend.

22

was saying he thought he liked cricket, but he was always

23

confused because he never knew when the game ended, and

24

there actually are rules for when the game ends.

25

An American

So I think where the goal line is is very

Page 182
1

important, and so I think the Commission and the staff

2

should be commended for bringing out the lore and the

3

prior guidance which was there and expanding it to the

4

extent you can, and I think our committee may have views

5

about in the same way that Rule 147 has changed with

6

technology and practice and communications that the goal

7

line may in fact have moved in a way that we can promote

8

capital formation and still protect investors and stay

9

true to the language of the statute.

10

MR. GRAHAM:

Annemarie, were you going to --

11

MS. TIERNEY:

If we're going to stay on the

12

general solicitation -- and that could be a little, kind

13

of drilled down, I think one of the things that's in the

14

current non-exclusive safe harbor for verification which

15

is a real kind of friction point is that if you're

16

verifying somebody under net worth, they -- it's only

17

good for 90 days.

18

certain number of days.

19

And the documents have to be within a

Under self-certification under -- for 506(b)

20

purposes, people certify one time a year that they're

21

accredited.

22

purposes now you're putting people in a bucket where they

23

have to potentially be certified at least once a quarter.

24

And I know for angels that we were dealing with, it was

25

So I don't understand why for 506(c)

really painful for them.

Like we just did this.

And if

Page 183
1

it was just past the 90-day and 92nd day from the date

2

that we did it, maybe we verified on March 1st, but the

3

deal didn't close until two months after that, and then

4

we had -- it was very painful.

5

I don't understand the investor protection or

6

other policy position that's supported by that policy.

7

But to the extent you can get unnecessary friction out of

8

the verification process, I think that would go a long

9

way to helping people think it was worth going through

10

the process.

11

MR. GRAHAM:

12

Jonathan.

13

MR. NELSON:

Thanks.

I would love to know what sort of

14

things can we do as a committee.

15

recommend something that general solicitation be defined

16

as X, Y and Z?

Can we resolve to

Can we --

17

MS. HANKS:

18

MR. NELSON:

We can try.
This is not the opinion of the SEC

19

or the President, but as the people who have been asked

20

to give our opinions, how do we give our opinions?

21

a discussion?

22

that we're delivering?

23

Is it a dialogue?

MR. GRAHAM:

Is it

What's the end product

What's kind of the mechanism?

One

24

thing that I would commend you to are the recommendations

25

as the committee in past years.

And what -- they're all

Page 184
1

on the website I'm sure.

2

like this.

3

issues that we decide then to kind of focus on and drill

4

down on.

5

consensus, we develop recommendations, and then we

6

consider recommendations specifically and talk about

7

them, amend them, pass them.

8
9

And the issues come up, and there's some

And with those issues as we move toward

MR. GUTIERREZ:
closing.

What we do is we have meetings

I'd like to make a comment in

When I think about the issue of capital

10

formation, I always think of the two players, right?

11

There's the business and then there's the capital

12

provider.

13

obviously the issues that we've discussed that are in the

14

way of businesses being able to access capital, whether

15

that's education, whether that's not knowing exactly what

16

the options are that our out there, whether that's

17

maneuvering through this maze of regulatory environment

18

in terms of issuing.

19

effort.

20

What I'd like to see from this committee is

So there's that whole, I guess,

I'd also like to raise the issue of part of the

21

inefficiency in the capital markets has to be who the

22

providers are.

23

talked about are how do we help foster capital sources

24

that may have better understanding and knowledge base of

25

these businesses, whether that's because we diversify who

So one of the conversations we haven't

Page 185
1

those capital sources are, I mean specifically talking

2

about women and minority-led investment firms and whether

3

or not this committee can be engaged in that or just

4

through different types of folks from different

5

industries that may or may not believe or understand that

6

they could be part of the capital source universe.

7

So I'm not sure if that's an endeavor that this

8

committee could take on, but clearly that is part of this

9

discussion of making capital formation more efficient is

10

taking a look at the face of the capital providers.

11

MR. GRAHAM:

For me that's included under

12

outreach.

13

that want something.

14

they're willing to pay for it.

15

businesses that -- saying, gee, I can do this or this or

16

this.

17

capital source wants.

18

disconnect that's out there that we should be able to

19

help -- kind of help, kind of get things aligned in the

20

right way.

21

I mean you've got people with pools of money
And they know what they want, and
And then you have

And -- but there's only one thing that this
And if -- it's that kind of

MS. YAMANAKA:

I'd like to chime in on that.

I

22

really support that idea.

23

tension that have applied to traditional sources, and the

24

world has changed out there.

25

internationally more.

I think that there's a lot of

We're competing

They have different types of

Page 186
1

market sources for capital formation within their own

2

countries and entities, and I think we're at a

3

competitive disadvantage if we don't at least offer

4

something similar, and it could be through minorities,

5

women-owned businesses.

6

But what's good in the opportunities for that

7

group is going to be good for small business in general.

8

So I think that this is a perfect opportunity to expand

9

our opportunities and how we look at things.

I do think

10

we need to fix and make -- address how things are done

11

traditionally.

12

mean to create a whole bunch of work for everybody.

13

really apologize.

14
15

But to really try to throw -- and I don't
I

But I think it's already happening underneath.
It's percolating under the radar.

People don't know

16

they're doing certain things.

17

they're a little bit not in compliance.

18

take a look, understand what is currently happening,

19

magnify the positive impacts of that, start to measure

20

how much of that capital formation actually is occurring

21

that we can't track because I think John was saying

22

earlier we don't -- they don't know because they don't

23

file, right?

24

find out where that is leading to in the chain upwards.

25

In some ways perhaps
But if we can

That it might be very, very interesting to

MR. GRAHAM:

Okay.

Anyone else?

Page 187
1

MR. HAHN:

I've got -- a potential topic for

2

discussion is around short-selling disclosures.

3

December, NASDAQ filed a rulemaking petition with the SEC

4

asking it to take action to require disclosures of

5

investors' short positions in parity with existing

6

disclosure requirements for long positions.

7

So in

So currently investment managers in funds must

8

publicly disclose long positions and significant long

9

transactions on a quarterly basis.

Short positions, on

10

the other hand, are only reported in an aggregate manner

11

by the national exchanges.

12

an environment with potential for manipulative or abusive

13

conduct.

14

Lack of transparency creates

I'm not sure about other industries, but in

15

biotech we're particularly vulnerable to short

16

manipulation due to the thinly traded stock and long time

17

between news events.

18

about -- nobody's proposing any limits on short selling.

19
20

Just to be clear, nobody's talking

It's simply an issue of equitable transparency in
reporting.

21

MR. GRAHAM:

22

Annemarie.

23

MS. TIERNEY:

Okay.

That's a good point.

So as a result of the JOBS Act

24

and other SEC initiatives, we have a much wider range of

25

options now for capital raise we've already discussed

Page 188
1

today.

2

places where -- you said earlier that there's

3

complications in what's out there that potentially makes

4

these exemptions not interesting to companies.

5

touched on earlier the idea that you could be a tier two,

6

Reg A company putting out periodic information, and

7

there's no resale safe harbor available to you under the

8

federal securities laws.

9

I think the committee should take a look at

And we

So one of the things I think we probably might

10

be worth looking into for us is supporting some kind of

11

amendment to Section 18 to cover transactions that occur

12

-- securities issued under tier two to the extent that

13

the companies voluntarily periodically reporting.

14

got all my words right.

15

They're periodically reporting, they're putting

16

information in the market.

17

exemption for your shareholders.

18

MR. GRAHAM:

19

MS. HANKS:

20
21

But that just seems odd to me.

But you don't have a resale

Right.
I think that's an important thing.

I think there's a lot of people who don't understand
that that is actually a problem out there.

22
23

I've

MS. TIERNEY:

You told me, Sara.

So I believe

it.

24

MR. GRAHAM:

25

MS. SHIMKAT:

So, Lisa.
I kind of want to just know --

Page 189
1

we've talked about a lot of things, but -- so what are

2

the next action steps?

3

heavily or could potentially be more heavily involved in

4

the outreach side and the education.

5

report that we had earlier, there was a lot of good

6

points there and a lot of discussion around the

7

information and the statistics that maybe sometimes

8

statistics open our eyes to not really our shortcomings,

9

but maybe we're focusing on the wrong issue.

Especially -- obviously I am more

In seeing the

10

And so as we looked at getting additional

11

training out there for the decision makers, who are

12

people going to, where are they getting their

13

information, and it's just like trying to go to the

14

newspaper to try to advertise to millennials.

15

doing what we need to do to get information out there

16

when it comes to the different types of equity?

17
18

So what would the next steps be?

Are we

I mean what -

-

19

MR. GRAHAM:

What we do is following this

20

meeting, Sara and I and the staff will try to make some

21

sense of our discussions, and then we will kind of

22

formulate a path forward and you all will be able to

23

react to that.

24
25

Patrick, did you have anything else you want to
add?

Page 190
1

MR. REARDON:

I would say studying sources of

2

liquidity because I know the investors I have represented

3

are always interested in small company exit strategies,

4

that they're interested in that.

5

topic that I would be interested in.

6

MR. NELSON:

So that would be a

I'd be interested in talking to

7

some of the crowdfunding platforms in Europe, like

8

Cedars, and some of maybe the regulators in the EU and

9

just hear from them about how has it gone to not have an

10

accredited investor limit, have they noticed fraud, that

11

sort of stuff.

12

talk with someone like Kiva who does capital formation

13

overseas in a very interesting way.

14

considered a securities offering if a group of people got

15

together online and -- like to an entrepreneur here?

16

don't know.

17

me.

18

It would be interesting to, I don't know,

I

That sort of stuff would be fascinating to

19

anybody from overseas.

budget.

21

Would that be

MR. GOMEZ:

I don't think we've ever brought
I don't know if that's in our

I thought your law firm's budget

22

was -- and, Steve, we can follow up on that and see what

23

the options are.

24
25

MR. GRAHAM:
else?

Okay.

Kyle?

Okay.

So, Catherine, anything

Page 191
1

MR. HAUPTMAN:

Just to that, whether we have a

2

live human being here from Europe or not, their

3

perspective I think is important.

4

the other day that they wanted to list their company on

5

the French exchange for startups.

6

to meet their needs.

7

never hear again.

8

MR. GRAHAM:

9

All right.

10
11

Somebody just told me

They had to go abroad

It's just a sentence I'd like to

Brian?

Xavier?

Robert?

Then can I entertain a motion to

adjourn four minutes early?
MR. YADLEY:

Just before we do that, just one

12

more thing.

13

budget is only for four meetings a year.

14

informally earlier about limitations on dates for

15

meetings and the importance of having a facility that

16

will accommodate our requirements under the Advisory

17

Committee Act be public and so on.

18

only has 13 members.

19

We're talking about budget.

Obviously, our
And we talked

But our committee

So as we try and finalize the dates for this

20

year, if two or three people can't be there, that's a

21

real chunk of the committee.

22

finalize the dates for May and October and circulate them

23

before they're finalized so that you see how many

24

committee members would be not just inconvenienced by,

25

for example, I have a public company client annual

And so to the extent we can

meeting and board meeting that has been moved twice, and

2

it's --

MR. GRAHAM:

I agree with you 100 percent, and

we will get right on that and see if we can't get those

5

things pinned down.

7

at 3:30.

But we need to respect everyone's

Do you need a second?
Do I need a second?

Yes.
