SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY REGULATORY RELIEF AND
SIMPLIFICATION
AGENCY:

Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION:

Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting amendments to its
disclosure and reporting requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to expand the number of companies that qualify for its scaled
disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies. Companies that have less than
$75 million in public equity float will qualify for the scaled disclosure requirements
under the amendments. Companies without a calculable public equity float will qualify if
their revenues were below $50 million in the previous year. To streamline and simplify
regulation, the amendments move the scaled disclosure requirements from Regulation
S-B into Regulation S-K.
DATES: Effective Date: February 4, 2008, except
for § 249.308b and Form 10-QSB, which will be removed effective October 31, 2008,
and Part 228, § 249.310b and Form 10-KSB, which will be removed effective March 15,
2009.
Compliance Dates: After the effective date of the rule amendments, companies
currently qualifying as “small business issuers” under Regulation S-B will have the
option to file their next annual report for a fiscal year ending on or after December 15,

2007 on either Form 10-KSB, using the scaled disclosure requirements in Regulation
S-B, or Form 10-K, using the new scaled disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K.
After a “small business issuer” files that next annual report, it will be required to file
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, and may elect to
comply with the new scaled disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K. Companies
newly qualifying as “smaller reporting companies” will have the option to use the new
scaled Regulation S-K requirements when filing their next periodic report due after the
effective date of the amendments. These companies will determine eligibility for smaller
reporting company status based on the last business day of their most recent second fiscal
quarter, or based on the alternative initial registration statement calculation discussed in
Section IV. If a registration statement was filed on an “SB” form before the effective
date of the rule amendments, and the company seeks to amend it after the effective date
of the rule amendments, the company must file the amendment on the appropriate form
available to the issuer without an “SB” designation. As discussed in Section IV, to
provide a transition period, these issuers will be able to continue using the disclosure
format and content based on the “SB” form until six months after the effective date.

I.

Background and Summary
At an open Commission meeting on May 23, 2007, we approved publication of

eight releases designed to update and improve federal securities regulations that
significantly affect smaller companies and their investors in today’s capital markets.17
These releases reflected our efforts during the past few years to provide responsive
solutions addressing the special characteristics and needs of smaller companies and their
investors. One of the releases (the “Proposing Release”) proposed rule amendments
intended to provide general regulatory relief and simplification for smaller companies
reporting under our rules.18 In that release, we proposed a series of amendments to our

17

These releases included (1) Release No. 33-8812 (June 20, 2007) [72 FR 35118] (proposing to
expand eligibility requirements of Forms S-3 and F-3 to permit registration of annual primary
offerings of up to a specified percentage of public float by companies with a public float of less
than $75 million). The Commission voted to approve this proposal at an December 11, 2007 open
meeting (archived webcast available at http://www.sec.gov/news/openmeetings.shtml);
(2) Release No. 33-8813 (June 22, 2007) [72 FR 36822] (proposing amendments to Rule 144 to
revise the holding period for the resale of restricted securities, simplify compliance for nonaffiliates, revise the Form 144 filing thresholds, and codify certain staff interpretations, as well as
to amend Rule 145). This proposal was adopted in Release No. 33-8869 (Dec. 6, 2007) [72 FR
71546]; (3) Release No. 33-8814 (June 29, 2007) [72 FR 37376] (proposing revisions to Form D
and to mandate electronic filing of Form D). The Commission voted to approve this proposal at
the December 11, 2007 open meeting (archived webcast available at
http://www.sec.gov/news/openmeetings.shtml); (4) Release No. 33-8819 (July 5, 2007) [72 FR
39670] (proposing to increase the number of companies eligible for our scaled disclosure and
reporting requirements for smaller companies); (5) Release No. 33-8828 (Aug. 3, 2007) [72 FR
45116] (proposing new Regulation D exemption for offers and sales of securities to a newly
defined category of “large accredited investors,” as well as proposing revisions to the Regulation
D definition of “accredited investor,” disqualification provisions, and integration safe harbor);
(6) Release No. 34-56010 (July 5, 2007) [72 FR 37608] (proposing exemptions from requirement
to register class of securities for compensatory stock options granted by reporting and nonreporting companies). This proposal was adopted in Release No. 34-56887 (Dec. 3, 2007) [72 FR
69554]; (7) Release No. 33-8810 (June 20, 2007) [72 FR 35324] (providing interpretive guidance
regarding management’s report on internal control over financial reporting under Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); and (8) Release No. 33-8811 (June 20, 2007) [72
FR 35346] (requesting additional comment on the definition of a significant deficiency). The last
proposal was adopted in Release No. 33-8829 (Aug. 3, 2007) [72 FR 44927] (adopting definition
of “significant deficiency”).

scaled disclosure and reporting requirements for smaller reporting companies. The
release had three stated objectives:
•	 expanding the number of smaller companies eligible to use scaled
disclosure requirements;
•	 reducing unnecessary complexity in our regulations by combining the
category of “small business issuers” with the category of “non-accelerated
filers” to the extent feasible; and
•	 simplifying disclosure requirements by moving our scaled disclosure
requirements for smaller companies from Regulation S-B into Regulation
S-K, the integrated disclosure system for other companies.
Several of the amendments in the Proposing Release had their genesis in the
recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies in
2006. The Commission had chartered the Advisory Committee in March 2005 to assess
the current regulatory system for smaller companies under the federal securities laws and
make recommendations for changes.19 Among the specific charges of the Committee
was to consider the corporate disclosure and reporting requirements for smaller
companies, including differing regulatory requirements based on market capitalization,
and other measurements of size or market characteristics.20 In its Final Report, the
Advisory Committee made several recommendations relating to scaling securities
regulation for smaller companies and labeled them as priority items.21

In 2006, 3,395 reporting companies elected to take advantage of our current scaled
disclosure and reporting requirements for small business issuers by filing their annual
reports on Form 10-KSB.22 We estimate that a total of 4,976 companies will be eligible
to use our scaled disclosure requirements under today’s amendments, a difference of
1,581 additional companies.23 The 1,581 companies would represent about 13% of the
total 11,898 reporting companies that filed annual reports with us in 2006.
The amendments that we are adopting address the need to revisit and adjust the
Commission’s small company policies to reflect changes in our securities markets as well
as changes to the regulatory landscape since 1992, when the Commission first adopted an
integrated scaled disclosure system for small business in Regulation S-B.24 The
Commission adopted Regulation S-B and its associated Forms SB-1 and SB-2 based
upon the success of Form S-18, which was a simplified registration form for smaller
companies under the Securities Act that preceded Forms SB-1 and SB-2.25 Regulation
S-B was designed to reduce compliance costs and improve the ability of start-ups and
other small businesses to obtain financing through the public capital markets.
The amendments we are adopting will result in the substantive changes highlighted
below. The new provisions:
22

As stated in the Proposing Release, these statistics are based on 2006 data from the Commission’s
EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval) filing system.

23

As we noted in the Proposing Release, these statistics are based on Thomson Financial
(Datastream). The data includes available information on registered public firms trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq, the Over-the-Counter
Bulletin Board, and the Pink Sheets and excludes closed end funds, exchange traded funds,
American depositary receipts, and direct foreign listings.

24

See Release No. 33-6949 (July 30, 1992) [57 FR 36442].

25

The Commission adopted Forms SB-1and SB-2 after 10 years of issuers using Form S-18, an
experimental form the Commission created to benefit small issuers in raising capital. Release No.
33-6924, p. 40 (Mar. 20, 1992) [57 FR 9768].

•

Establish a category of “smaller reporting companies” eligible to use our scaled
disclosure requirements. The primary determinant for eligibility will be that
the company have less than $75 million in public float. When a company is
unable to calculate public float, however, such as if it has no common equity
outstanding or no market price for its outstanding common equity exists at the
time of the determination, the standard will be less than $50 million in revenue
in the last fiscal year;

•

Move 12 non-financial scaled disclosure item requirements from Regulation
S-B into Regulation S-K.26 These scaled requirements will be available only
for smaller reporting companies. The remaining 24 item requirements of
Regulation S-B27 are substantially the same as their corresponding Regulation

26

The 12 scaled item requirements are: (1) Description of Business (Item 101); (2) Market Price of
and Dividends on Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters (Item 201);
(3) Selected Financial Data (Item 301); (4) Supplementary Financial Information (Item 302);
(5) Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Item 303); (6) Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (Item 305);
(7) Executive Compensation (Item 402); (8) Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and
Certain Control Persons (Item 404); (9) Corporate Governance (Item 407); (10) Prospectus
Summary, Risk Factors, and Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges (Item 503); (11) Use of Proceeds
(Item 504); and (12) Exhibits (Item 601).

27

We did not propose changes to the following items of Regulation S-K because we believe our
analysis showed that the disclosure standards in these items currently are substantially the same as
the Regulation S-B requirements: (1) Description of Property (Item 102); (2) Legal Proceedings
(Item 103); (3) Description of Registrant’s Securities (Item 202); (4) Changes In and
Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure (Item 304);
(5) Disclosure Controls and Procedures (Item 307); (6) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
(Item 308); (7) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Item 308T); (8) Directors, Executive
Officers, Promoters and Control Persons (Item 401); (9) Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management (Item 403); (10) Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
(Item 405); (11) Code of Ethics (Item 406); (12) Forepart of Registration Statement and Outside
Front Cover Page of Prospectus (Item 501); (13) Inside Front and Outside Back Cover Pages of
Prospectus (Item 502); (14) Determination of Offering Price (Item 505); (15) Dilution (Item 506);
(16) Selling Security Holders (Item 507); (17) Plan of Distribution (Item 508); (18) Interest of
Named Experts and Counsel (Item 509); (19) Disclosure of Commission Position on
Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities (Item 510); (20) Other Expenses of Issuance and
Distribution (Item 511); (21) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from
Registered Securities (Item 701); (22) Indemnification of Directors and Officers (Item 702); and
(23) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers (Item 703). In
addition, although we proposed to amend Undertakings (Item 512), we are not adopting this

10




S-K item requirements. We therefore are not amending them except in one
minor instance explained below;28
•	 Move the scaled financial statement requirements in Item 310 of Regulation
S-B into new Article 8 of Regulation S-X, and amend these requirements to
provide a scaled disclosure option for smaller reporting companies, requiring
two years of balance sheet data instead of one year, and make other minor
adjustments after considering comments we received;29
•	 Permit smaller reporting companies to elect to comply with scaled financial
and non-financial disclosure on an item-by-item or “a la carte” basis. As
adopted, eligible companies may elect to follow scaled financial statement
requirements or to provide the larger company financial statement presentation
on a quarterly basis, rather than require companies to elect the full fiscal year’s
financial presentation in the first quarterly report of the fiscal year, as was
proposed;
•	 Eliminate our current “SB” forms but allow a phase-out period for small
business issuers transitioning to smaller reporting company status;
•	 Combine elements relating to the accelerated filer definition with qualifying
standards for the smaller reporting company determination and transition

change because we believe it is clear which undertakings may and may not apply to a smaller
reporting company.
28

See the discussion of Description of Property (Item 102) below. In addition, we are making
technical changes to numerous item requirements to remove references to Regulation S-B and its
associated “SB” forms.

29

The amendments also rescind Regulation S-B, since all of its substantive requirements will now be
contained in Regulation S-K or new Article 8 of Regulation S-X.

11




provisions to promote uniformity and consistency with current regulations and,
therefore, simplify regulation;
•	 Permit all foreign companies to qualify as “smaller reporting companies” if
they otherwise qualify and choose to file on domestic company forms and
provide financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”); and
•	 Eliminate the transitional small business issuer format.
II.

Description of Proposed Amendments
We proposed an eligibility standard for our scaled disclosure requirements for

“smaller reporting companies” to replace the “small business issuer” definition found in
Item 10 of Regulation S-B.30 Under the proposals, the new definition of “smaller
reporting company” would have established eligibility for companies with less than $75
million in public common equity float. We provided an alternative revenue test for those
companies unable to calculate public common equity float, basing eligibility on whether
the company had annual revenues of less than $50 million in its last fiscal year. In
contrast, our previous eligibility requirements for “small business issuer” status required
that companies have both less than $25 million in public common equity float and less
than $25 million in annual revenues.
Under the proposals, which we are adopting in modified form, each company
would determine its eligibility based on whether the company is: (1) a reporting
company already filing periodic and annual reports;31 (2) a non-reporting company filing

30

17 CFR 228.10.

31

A reporting company is required to file reports under Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange
Act. 15 U.S.C. 78m and 15 U.S.C. 78o.

12




a registration statement under either the Securities Act or Exchange Act; or (3) a
reporting or non-reporting company that had no public float, such as if it had no public
common equity outstanding or no market price for its common equity existed. A
reporting company determining its eligibility as a smaller reporting company would
calculate its public float as of the last business day of its most recently completed second
fiscal quarter. Non-reporting companies filing a registration statement would calculate
their public float as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration
statement.
Under the proposals, investment companies and asset-backed issuers would be
excluded from eligibility for smaller reporting company status, as was the case under the
definition of “small business issuer” in Regulation S-B.32 As proposed, foreign
companies could qualify as smaller reporting companies and provide scaled disclosure if
they elected to use domestic company forms and provide financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. Removing the exclusion of foreign companies would make
scaled treatment available to additional smaller companies.33
We proposed that smaller reporting companies be required to exit the scaled
disclosure system the fiscal year after their public float rose above $75 million as of the
last business day of their second fiscal quarter.34 Smaller reporting companies attempting
to establish eligibility to enter the scaled disclosure system again would be required to
determine that their public float fell below $50 million as of the last business day of their

32

Item 10(a)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-B, 17 CFR 228.10(a)(1)(iii).

33

Item 10(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-B only permits U.S. or Canadian issuers to qualify as “small
business issuers.”

34

The entering and exiting rules in the smaller reporting company system are modeled after the
method of determining accelerated filer status set forth in Rule 12b-2. 17 CFR 240.12b-2.

13




second fiscal quarter, and would be able to use scaled disclosure again in the next fiscal
year following the determination, starting with the first Form 10-Q of the next fiscal year.
An objective of our proposals was to simplify and improve our disclosure and
reporting rules for smaller companies by moving the Regulation S-B disclosure
requirements for smaller companies into Regulation S-K, as recommended by the SEC
Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies. As a result of our rulemaking, we
identified 13 item requirements in Regulation S-B that provided scaled disclosure for
smaller companies.35 We reasoned that consolidation of the Regulation S-K and S-B
disclosure requirements would provide a more unified set of rules that would be easier to
use. To accomplish this, we proposed to move item requirements in Regulation S-B
containing substantive scaled non-financial disclosure requirements into Regulation S-K
by adding a new paragraph to the items of Regulation S-K that would contain separate
disclosure standards for smaller reporting companies. We did not propose any major
substantive changes to the items we were moving from Regulation S-B into Regulation
S-K, but sought comment from the public on substantive changes they would
recommend.
One of the item requirements in Regulation S-B providing scaled disclosure
requirements did not have a similar disclosure item requirement in Regulation S-K.
Consequently, our specific proposals included adding a new Item 310 in Regulation S-K
for financial statements. Item 310 of Regulation S-K would have set forth the alternative
requirements on form and content of financial statements for smaller companies that
formerly appeared in Item 310 of Regulation S-B.

35

See note 26 above.

14




The proposals also allowed a smaller reporting company to choose, on an itemby-item basis or “a la carte” basis, to comply with either the scaled disclosure and
financial reporting requirements made available in Regulation S-K for smaller reporting
companies or the requirements for other companies in Regulation S-K, when the
requirements for other companies were more rigorous.
The proposal, like the amendments we are adopting, would rescind all of our forms
designated with the letters “SB.” Smaller reporting companies would be eligible to file
on Form S-1, rather than on Form SB-1 or SB-2 as before, to offer securities to the
public. This would provide a smaller reporting company the ability to incorporate by
reference its previously filed Exchange Act reports if the company meets the
requirements set forth under General Instruction VII of Form S-1.36
Finally, the proposals, like the amendments we are adopting, would eliminate the
“transitional small business issuer format” associated with Form SB-1 and annual reports
on Form 10-KSB.37 A small business issuer using the transitional format followed
disclosure based on Model A or B found in Regulation A. These two disclosure models
were intended to ease transition from non-reporting to reporting status for small business
issuers preparing disclosure on initial registration statements and annual reports. In our

36

General Instruction VII of Form S-1 sets forth the eligibility criteria to qualify for incorporation by
reference. The registrant must be required to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and must have filed all reports and materials during the
preceding 12 months. The company must have filed an annual report for its most recently
completed fiscal year. Section D of the instruction disqualifies companies that, in the past three
years, were any of the following:
(a)	 A blank check company as defined in Rule 419(a)(2);
(b)	 A shell company, other than a business combination related shell company, each as
defined in Rule 405; or
(c)	 A registrant for any offering of penny stock as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the
Exchange Act.

Proposing Release we noted, however, that the number of companies registering on Form
SB-1 and following the disclosure format within Form 10-KSB had significantly declined
over time.38
We received 21 comment letters on the proposals,39 including six from public
accounting firms. We also received comment letters from professional and trade
associations, a law firm, an associate professor of finance, two small business owners,
and the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy. In general, the comment
letters strongly supported our efforts to simplify our scaled disclosure requirements for
smaller reporting companies and expand eligibility for them.
III.

Discussion of Amendments We Are Adopting

After considering the public comments, we are adopting the amendments
substantially as we proposed them, with the modifications discussed below.
A. 	

Moving Scaled Disclosure Item Requirements from Regulation S-B
into Regulation S-K

Many of the comment letters supported moving our scaled disclosure requirements
from Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K.40 In general, the comments in these letters
viewed moving the requirements as having a positive impact by reducing complexity and
promoting more streamlined regulation. One letter noted that combining the two
disclosure systems would allow smaller reporting companies to more easily evaluate the
extent of the differences between the requirements for smaller reporting companies and
38

For example, during the past five years, the Commission has received only 56 Form SB-1
registration statements. For years 2000 through 2005, two small business issuers out of 56 filed a
Form 10-KSB using the transitional disclosure format.

39

The public comments we received are available for inspection in our Public Reference Room at
100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549 in File No. S7-15-07, or may be viewed at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-15-07/s71507.shtml.

16




larger companies and consider which requirement better meets the needs of their
investors.41
A few comment letters opposed moving the scaled disclosure requirements into
Regulation S-K, indicating that having all of the smaller company rules in one place was
convenient for smaller companies.42 These comment letters expressed concern that the
migration into Regulation S-K would increase legal and accounting costs for smaller
companies and make the rules more complex for smaller companies to understand. A
few comment letters suggested providing the scaled smaller reporting company
disclosure requirements in a separate section of Regulation S-K.43
We are adopting our proposal to move our Regulation S-B scaled disclosure
requirements into Regulation S-K. After considering the comments, we believe
combining the two disclosure systems and setting out the smaller reporting company
scaled item requirements in separate paragraphs within Regulation S-K is appropriate.
We believe our amendments eliminate redundancies and provide a more streamlined
disclosure system for smaller reporting companies. In response to the concern that
moving the item requirements will create complexity for smaller companies, we are
including an index of scaled disclosure requirements in the definition of smaller reporting
company at the beginning of Regulation S-K44 to highlight items of the Regulation that
contain the scaled disclosure requirements specific to smaller reporting companies.

See new Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K (Index of Scaled Disclosure Available to Smaller Reporting
Companies).

17




Regulation S-B has 12 non-financial item requirements that provide scaled
disclosure options to smaller reporting companies. Under this rulemaking, these 12 item
requirements are being moved to separate paragraphs within Regulation S-K. In some
cases, smaller reporting companies are not required to provide disclosures required of
larger companies. For example, while larger companies are required to provide
disclosure under Item 305 on quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk,
smaller companies are not currently required to do so under the same item requirement in
Regulation S-B. In cases like this, we include a paragraph in the relevant item of
Regulation S-K indicating that smaller reporting companies are not required to respond to
the item.
In addition to the Regulation S-B and S-K differences, the forms themselves may
contain different disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies. Currently,
Forms 10-SB, 10-KSB and 10-QSB do not require risk factor disclosure from small
business issuers. The amendments carry this difference in disclosure requirements over
to Forms 10, 10-K and 10-Q by adding instructions indicating that smaller reporting
companies are not required to provide risk factor disclosure in these Exchange Act forms.
B. 	

Moving Smaller Reporting Company Financial Statement
Requirements from Item 310 of Regulation S-B into New Article 8 of
Regulation S-X; Additional Regulation S-X Changes

Several comment letters recommended moving the rules on form and content of
financial statements for smaller reporting companies now in Item 310 of Regulation S-B
into Regulation S-X, rather than into a new Item 310 of Regulation S-K, as proposed.
Several comment letters also agreed with the Advisory Committee recommendation to
require smaller reporting companies to provide two years of comparative audited balance

18




sheet data in annual financial statements under these rules, rather than one year, as is
currently required under Regulation S-B.45 The comment letters are persuasive that we
should adopt these recommendations as part of our rule amendments. Accordingly, we
are moving the financial statement rules for smaller reporting companies into a new
Article 8 of Regulation S-X46 and will require two years of comparative audited balance
sheet data of smaller reporting companies. Comparative balance sheets will provide a
much more meaningful presentation for investors without a significant additional burden
on smaller reporting companies, since the earlier year data should be readily available for
the purposes of preparing the other financial statements.47 We also are making technical
and language changes to the rules on form and content of financial statements for smaller
public companies to facilitate their placement in Article 8 of Regulation S-X rather than
in Regulation S-B or Regulation S-K.
We also are adopting technical amendments to Rule 3-05(b)(2)(iv) of Regulation
S-X that were tied conceptually to the small business issuer threshold in Regulation S-B
that we are replacing with the definition of smaller reporting company in Regulation S-K.
Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X requires the inclusion of financial statements of businesses
acquired or to be acquired, so-called “target companies,” in registration statements and
Form 8-K reports. The number of years of audited financial statements to be included for
a target company is determined using the conditions specified in the definition of
significant subsidiary in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X. If the net revenues reported by

the target company for the latest fiscal year are less than $25 million and three years of
financial statements would otherwise be required, the earliest of the three fiscal years
may be omitted pursuant to Rule 3-05(b)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-X.
Several comment letters noted that in light of the $50 million in revenues
threshold proposed for determining a company’s qualification as a smaller reporting
company if a company is unable to calculate public float, the Commission should
consider revising this rule to raise to $50 million the $25 million threshold currently used
to limit to two the periods required for audited financial statements of an acquired
business.48 The $25 million threshold was based on the $25 million in revenues standard
in Regulation S-B that we are rescinding.49 We are amending this standard to increase
the threshold to $50 million in revenues, as suggested by the commenters.
C.

Adopting Scaled Disclosure Item Requirements in Regulation S-K

1.

Overview

The following is a list of item requirements we are amending in Regulation S-K to
include the substance of the scaled standards for smaller reporting companies now in the
same item number of Regulation S-B. The adopted amendments are substantially as
described in the Proposing Release, but with the changes discussed below:
Item 101 (Description of Business). We are adding a new paragraph (h) to this
item to set forth the alternative disclosure standards for smaller companies that appeared
in Item 101 of Regulation S-B. Generally, the different requirements for smaller

48

See, e.g., Letter from Center for Audit Quality (CAQ).

49

In 1996, the Commission adopted revisions to rules that streamlined requirements with respect to
financial statements of significant business acquisitions in filings made under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act. The $25 million threshold limit was intended to be consistent with criteria for
small business issuers. Release No. 33-7355, p. 36 (Oct. 10, 1996).

20




reporting companies under Item 101 involve providing a less detailed description of the
company’s business. For example, the Regulation S-K standard for Item 101 requires
financial information about segments, which the standard for smaller reporting
companies does not require.50 In addition, smaller reporting companies will be required
to provide and disclose business development activities for only three years, instead of
the five-year disclosure required of larger companies by Item 101 of Regulation S-K.
We also are implementing additional minor revisions that replace the reference to
Canadian issuers. Since we are making the smaller reporting company standards
available to foreign issuers generally, we are requiring that these issuers provide
disclosure on enforceability of civil liability against foreign persons. Previously, Item
101 of Regulation S-B had required this disclosure from Canadian issuers only because
those were the only foreign issuers eligible for Regulation S-B disclosure standards. The
item requirement applicable to smaller reporting companies also will no longer refer to
the foreign private issuer requirement to disclose whether the report will include a
reconciliation of financial information with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, because smaller reporting companies must provide financial statements
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Item 201 (Market Price of and Dividends on Registrant’s Common Equity and
Related Stockholder Matters). We are revising Instruction 6 to paragraph (e) of this
Regulation S-K item requirement to reflect that smaller reporting companies (instead of
“small business issuers”) are not required to provide a performance graph.

50

Application of U.S. GAAP (FAS 131) may, however, require segment information in the notes to the
financial statements. 17 CFR 229.101(b).

21




Item 301 (Selected Financial Data); Item 302 (Supplementary Financial
Information). We are adding a new paragraph (c) to each item requirement, providing
that smaller reporting companies are not required to present the information required by
these item requirements.
Item 303 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations). As provided in new paragraph (d), this item sets forth the scaled
requirements.51 For example, under this item requirement, smaller reporting companies
will:
•	 Provide only two years of analysis if the company is presenting only two
years of financial statements, instead of the three years of analysis required of
larger companies that are required to provide three years of financial
statements; and
•	 Not be required to provide tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
Item 305 (Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk). New
paragraph (e) in this item specifies that smaller reporting companies are not required to
disclose Item 305 information.
Item 402 (Executive Compensation). New paragraphs (l) through (r) set forth the
alternative standards for smaller reporting companies for disclosure of compensation of
executives and directors that were in Item 402 of Regulation S-B.52 Smaller reporting
companies will:

51

As discussed below, we are also adding references to two Industry Guides to this item.

52

As proposed, the scaled disclosure for this item would have been in new paragraph (l), but in order
to clarify the requirements, the adopted Item restates the requirements for smaller reporting
companies in several paragraphs.

22




•	

Provide executive compensation disclosure for only three named executive
officers (specifically including the principal executive officer but not the
principal financial officer), rather than the five required of larger
companies;

•	

Provide the Summary Compensation Table disclosure for only two years,
rather than the three years required of larger companies;

•	

Not be required to provide a Compensation Discussion and Analysis;

•	

Provide only three of the seven tables53 required of larger companies;

•	

Provide alternative narrative disclosures; and

•	

Not be required to include footnote disclosure of the grant date fair value
of equity awards in the Director Compensation Table.

Item 404 (Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control
Persons). We are making changes to the introductory text of paragraph (c)(1), and adding
paragraph (d) before the instructions to this item to change the calculation of total assets
for smaller reporting companies from 1% of their total assets based on the average of
total assets at year end for the last three completed fiscal years to the last two completed
fiscal years. We believe this standard is more consistent with the two years of financial
statements required of smaller reporting companies. Under new Item 404(d) of
Regulation S-K, smaller reporting companies will:54

53

These are the Summary Compensation Table, the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End
Table, and the Director Compensation Table.

54

See Section III.C.2, clarifying that to the extent the smaller reporting company scaled disclosure
requirement is more rigorous than the same larger company item requirement, smaller reporting
companies will be required to comply with the more rigorous smaller reporting company
requirement.

23




•	

Not be required to disclose policies and procedures for reviewing related
person transactions, which is required of larger companies;

•	

Be required to provide disclosure regarding a transaction where the
amount exceeds the lesser of 1% of a smaller company’s total assets or
$120,000;

•	

Be required to provide additional specific information about underwriting
discounts and commissions, and corporate parents; and

•	

Be required to provide disclosure regarding promoters and certain control
persons.

Item 407 (Corporate Governance). New paragraph (g) to Item 407 of Regulation
S-K specifies that smaller reporting companies are:
•	

Not required to provide Compensation Committee Interlock and Insider
Participation disclosure or a Compensation Committee Report; and

•	

Not required to provide an Audit Committee [Financial Expert]* Report
until the first annual report after their initial registration statement is filed
with the Commission and becomes effective.

Item 503 (Prospectus Summary, Risk Factors, and Ratio of Earnings to Fixed
Charges). New paragraph (e) to this item specifies that smaller reporting companies need
not provide the information required by paragraph (d) of Item 503 regarding the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges when a registrant issues debt, or the ratio of combined fixed
charges and preference dividends to earnings when a registrant issues preference equity
securities. In addition, we have added instructions to the risk factor disclosure
requirements set forth in Exchange Act Forms 10, 10-K and 10-Q to indicate that smaller
*Note: The bracketed language was inadvertently omitted from this release when initially published on
December 19, 2007.

24

reporting companies are not required to provide Item 503 risk factor disclosure in these
filings.55
Item 504 (Use of Proceeds). We are revising Instruction 6 to this item to clarify
that new Article 8 of Regulation S-X, rather than the other articles of Regulation S-X,
will govern whether financial statements of businesses proposed to be acquired must be
included in the filings of smaller reporting companies.
Item 601 (Exhibits). New paragraph (c) reflects that smaller reporting companies
need not provide Exhibit 12 (Statements re Computation of Ratios).
Other Regulation S-K Items. We identified 24 item requirements in Regulation
S-B that were substantially similar or identical to the same numbered item requirements
in Regulation S-K. In these cases, we determined it was appropriate to require that
smaller reporting companies follow the same item requirements as larger companies. In
the Proposing Release, we identified Item 512 (Undertakings) as a scaled item
requirement for smaller reporting companies; however, we now believe no change is
needed because it is clear which undertakings may apply to a smaller reporting
company’s filings. We are, therefore, not including a new paragraph (m) in Regulation
S-K, as proposed.
In addition, as described below, we are amending Item 102 (Description of
Property) of Regulation S-K to include references to the Industry Guides56 noted below

55

See Section III.A above. The Securities Offering Reform final rule amendments stated that the
risk factor disclosure requirement did not apply to small business issuers filing on Form 10-KSB
or Form 10-SB. The amendments we are adopting carry this difference in disclosure requirements
over to the Forms 10, 10-K and 10-Q for smaller reporting companies. See Securities Offering
Reform Release 33-8591 (July 19, 2005) [70 FR 44722, 44786-87].

56

The Industry Guides serve as expressions of the policies and practices of the Division of
Corporation Finance. They are of assistance to issuers, their counsel and others preparing
registration statements and reports, as well as to the Commission’s staff. The Industry Guides are

25




and highlighting the requirements of Item 401 (Directors, executive officers, promoters
and control persons). To further maintain consistency with references to other industry
guides in the disclosure item requirements, we also are adding instructions to Item 303
directing companies’ attention to:
•	 Industry Guide 3 – Statistical disclosure by bank holding companies; and
•	 Industry Guide 6 – Disclosure concerning unpaid claims and claim adjustment
expenses of property-casualty insurance underwriters.
The Regulation S-B item requirement on the Description of Property in Item 102
included detailed instructions specific to small business issuers engaged in: (1)
significant mining operations; (2) oil and gas producing activities; and (3) real estate
activities. Under Item 102 of Regulation S-B, mining companies are directed to the
information called for in Industry Guide 7; oil and gas producing issuers are directed to
the information called for in Industry Guide 2; and real estate companies are directed to
the information called for in Industry Guide 5. Regulation S-K, however, does not
include any references to these industry guides. Several commenters suggested that we
revise Item 102 of Regulation S-K to include references to industry guides.57 We agree,
and are amending Item 102 of Regulation S-K to include references to the following
industry guides:
•	 Industry Guide 2 – Disclosure of oil and gas operations;
•	 Industry Guide 4 – Prospectus relating to interests in oil and gas programs;

not rules, regulations, or statements of the Commission. The Commission has neither approved 

nor disapproved these interpretations. See Release 33-6384 (Mar. 16, 1982). 

57

See, e.g., Letters from KPMG and Grant Thornton. 


26

•	 Industry Guide 5 – Preparation of registration statements relating to interests in
real estate limited partnerships; and
•	 Industry Guide 7 – Description of property by issuers engaged or to be engaged
in significant mining operations.
Item 401 of Regulation S-K (Directors, executive officers, promoters and control
persons), differs from Regulation S-B in one respect. Under Regulation S-B, the
disclosure pertaining to Federal bankruptcy laws or state insolvency laws related only to
“any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a
general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two
years prior to that time.”58 Under Regulation S-K, disclosure must be provided
pertaining to any petitions filed under the Federal bankruptcy laws or any state
insolvency laws filed by or against a director or officer of the company.59 We believe it
is appropriate to require disclosure about a personal bankruptcy petition filed by or
against a director or officer of a smaller reporting company given that, in light of the
generally smaller level of operations of smaller reporting companies, it may be material
to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any director or person to be nominated to
become a director or executive officer of the smaller reporting company. Accordingly,
smaller reporting companies now will be required to comply with the slightly different
disclosure requirement of the Regulation S-K item.

58

See Item 401(d)(1) of Regulation S-B. 17 CFR 228.401(d)(1). Under Regulation S-B, issuers
provide legal proceedings disclosure about promoters and control persons for the past five years.
Regulation S-K requires disclosure on legal proceedings for control persons and promoters for
registrants that have not been subject to the reporting requirements for Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act for the twelve months immediately before the filing of the registration
statement, report or statement. 17 CFR 229.401(f) and (g).

2.

Electing Scaled Disclosure Standards on “A La Carte” Basis

Commenters generally supported the proposal to allow smaller reporting
companies to choose compliance with either the smaller reporting company scaled
disclosure requirements or the larger company disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K
on an item-by-item or “a la carte” basis.60 One comment letter expressed the view that
the smaller reporting company disclosure requirements would serve as a baseline that
would allow companies to provide any additional disclosure they deemed important to
investors.61 Another set of comments noted that the “a la carte” approach is already
sanctioned by disclosure rules generally.62 This letter explained that line-item disclosure
requirements generally permit providing more disclosure than is required by the line
items. Additionally, issuers are required to disclose all material facts that are necessary
to make the statements included in the document not misleading, which may require
disclosures in excess of line item requirements.63
Some accounting firms commenting on the a la carte approach requested that we
address what one commenter referred to as the “lock-in” aspect of the proposal. In the
Proposing Release, we explained that a smaller reporting company would have the option
to take advantage of the smaller reporting company requirements for one, some, all or
none of the item requirements, at its election, in any one filing. We proposed to require,
however, that a smaller reporting company provide its financial statements on the basis of

60

See, e.g., Letter from Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA).

61

See Letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte).

62

See Letter from ABA.

63

The ABA cited the following in support of this statement: Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the
Securities Act and Rule 408 under the Securities Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 12b-20 under the
Exchange Act.

28




the scaled financial statement requirements or the larger company financial statement
requirements for a single fiscal year, and not be permitted to switch back and forth from
one to another in different filings within a single fiscal year.
One accounting firm noted that it was unclear how the a la carte approach would
work if issuers were required to elect in the first quarterly report whether they would
follow the scaled financial statement requirements or the larger company Regulation S-X
requirements in that same fiscal year’s annual report on Form 10-K.64 According to this
letter, making a determination in this manner would require a smaller reporting company
that wants to preserve the option of following the smaller reporting company
requirements in its annual report on Form 10-K to adhere to the smaller reporting
company rules and not provide any additional information in the first quarterly report on
Form 10-Q. Another accounting firm expressed the concern that a smaller reporting
company might elect to provide more than the minimum disclosures only in periods when
the additional disclosures tended to be favorable.65 These comment letters agreed that the
a la carte approach would work if the Commission clarified that although the smaller
reporting company disclosure and financial statement requirements would appear to
establish the minimum disclosure requirements, Rule 12b-20 under the Exchange Act66
would require that a smaller reporting company provide any additional information
beyond those minimum disclosure requirements, in order to avoid a misleading
presentation.67 The accounting firms suggested that we encourage smaller reporting

29




companies to provide consistent disclosures in succeeding periods in order to respond to
investor expectations and allow period-to-period comparisons.
The proposals would have required companies to make the determination whether
to report financial statement disclosure on a scaled basis in the first quarter due after the
fiscal year covering the determination date. After reviewing the suggestions in several
comment letters, however, we believe it is appropriate to permit smaller reporting
companies to choose to comply with both the non-financial and financial item
requirements on an item-by-item basis when these disclosures are provided consistently
and when they are consistent with the legal requirements under the federal securities
laws, including Securities Act Rule 408 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-20. Additionally,
we stress the importance of providing disclosure that permits investors to make period-to­
period comparisons, whether quarterly or annually.
We continue to expect that our staff will evaluate item-by-item compliance by
smaller reporting companies with only the Regulation S-K requirements applicable to
smaller reporting companies, and not with the requirements applicable to larger
companies. This will be the case even if the company whose filing is being reviewed
chooses to comply with the larger company requirements. Finally, as we noted in the
Proposing Release, the a la carte approach will have no effect on the legal requirements
and liabilities that apply to all disclosures made by issuers.68
We are further clarifying that to the extent the smaller reporting company scaled
item requirement is more rigorous than the same larger company item requirement,
smaller reporting companies will be required to comply with the more rigorous, smaller

68

Release No. 33-8819, n. 76 p. 33 [72 FR 39678].

30




reporting company item requirement. Also, we do not believe it is appropriate for a
smaller reporting company to comply with a larger reporting company Regulation S-K
item requirement if that requirement sets a higher threshold obviating the need for the
smaller reporting company to provide disclosure. For example, unlike the larger
company requirement under Item 404 of Regulation S-K, smaller reporting companies
are required to disclose additional specific information about underwriting discounts and
commissions and corporate parents.69 In this case, a smaller reporting company would be
required to provide the additional Item 404 disclosure.
Currently, the smaller reporting company requirements under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K70 present the only instance where the scaled requirements could be more
rigorous than the larger company standard. This is because a smaller reporting company
is required to provide disclosure on a related person transaction since the beginning of the
company’s last fiscal year if the amount involved in the transaction exceeds the lesser of
$120,000 or 1% of the average of the company’s total assets at year end for the last two
completed fiscal years. In contrast, a larger company reporting under the same Item 404
Regulation S-K requirement is required to provide disclosure on a related person
transaction since the beginning of the last fiscal year if the transaction exceeds
$120,000.71 A smaller reporting company’s related person transaction may more easily
exceed 1% of the average of the smaller reporting company’s total assets than $120,000,
as required for larger companies under the same item requirement. We believe this may

be the case because 1% of a smaller company’s total assets might be appreciably lower
than $120,000.
D.

Eliminating “SB” Forms Associated with Regulation S-B

While some comment letters appeared to support the elimination of the forms
designated with the letters “SB” associated with Regulation S-B,72 along with moving the
smaller reporting company requirements from Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K,
others questioned whether this approach would reduce compliance burdens and lower
costs for smaller companies.73 Some of the letters questioning the elimination of the SB
forms recommended a two-year phase-in period to help smaller companies adjust to the
transition. Some letters expressed a general perception that eliminating the SB forms
would lead to increased costs for smaller reporting companies because Forms 10, 10-K,
10-Q and S-1, which would be used by smaller companies if the SB forms were
eliminated, appeared to have more item disclosure requirements.74 One commenter
stated, however, that eliminating the “SB” forms would provide both time and cost
savings to smaller reporting companies that will be eligible to incorporate information
from their previously filed Exchange Act periodic reports into a Form S-1 registration
statement.75 None of the comment letters explained how using Forms 10, 10-K, 10-Q,
and S-1 would increase costs for smaller reporting companies. One letter noted,
however, that a smaller company probably would take longer to go through Form 10-K

and Form 10-Q to figure out exactly what applied to the company and what did not apply
in terms of required disclosures.76 In contrast, another comment letter noted that the
elimination of “SB” forms would allow smaller reporting companies to incorporate
information from their previously filed Exchange Act reports into a Form S-1 registration
statement, which would result in time and cost savings to the smaller reporting
company.77
Some of the comment letters apparently misperceived that the SB forms are simpler
and shorter than forms larger companies use. This is not the case. The SB forms
themselves are not necessarily simpler to use than the forms that larger companies use.
The scaling and increased simplicity for smaller companies generally occurs in the item
requirements of Regulation S-B, rather than the associated SB forms, and we are moving
the item requirements into Regulation S-K with very few changes.78
Nevertheless, after considering the comments, we have decided not to eliminate the
Exchange Act reporting SB forms immediately, but to phase them out to ease the
transition for smaller companies. We considered commenters’ concerns regarding
current small business issuers moving to the Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and concluded that
our transition schedule will provide an adequate period for these companies to continue
to file reports on these forms, if they so desire.79 Further, to help current small business
issuers make the transition, the Division of Corporation Finance’s Office of Small

Moreover, the SB forms are not necessarily substantially shorter than the comparable forms for
larger companies. Form 10-SB is actually longer, at 4 ½ pages, than Form 10, which is less than 4
full pages long; Form 10-KSB is 11 pages long, while Form 10-K is 12; Form SB-2 is 5 pages
long, while Form S-1 is just over 6 pages, not including instructions on summary prospectuses.

Qualifying Standards for Treatment as “Smaller Reporting
Company”

Many of the comment letters in favor of our proposed definition of “smaller
reporting company” agreed that combining the categories of non-accelerated filers with
small business issuers for purposes of the definition provided a convenient and simple
approach because it tracks the accelerated filer definition and reduces regulatory
complexity.80 In the Proposing Release, we reasoned that requiring only a public float
test for most companies to qualify would provide additional simplicity, consistency and
certainty. Eliminating a revenue test also would broaden the category of eligible
companies. Our decision to focus on a company’s non-affiliate common equity market
capitalization or “public float” was also consistent with the Commission’s current
regulatory standards for purposes of Form 10-K, Form S-3, and the accelerated filer
definition. Setting the public float ceiling at $75 million for smaller reporting companies
further aligns the smaller reporting company definition with the non-accelerated filer
definition.
The Advisory Committee recommended that we require companies to determine
eligibility based on total equity market capitalization rather than public float. Although
the Advisory Committee acknowledged that the Commission has historically and
consistently used public float as a measurement in analogous regulatory contexts, it stated
that equity market capitalization would better measure total financial exposure to

See, e.g., Letters from PricewaterhouseCoopers and E&Y.

34




investors.81 The Advisory Committee recommended extending the Commission’s non­
financial scaled disclosure requirements, covering disclosure and reporting, to companies
in the lowest 1% of market capitalization. Some of the comment letters we received on
the Proposing Release agreed with the Advisory Committee equity market capitalization
preference, stating that it was simpler and more widely understood than the calculation of
public float. The majority of comment letters supported our proposals to require a public
float standard only, agreeing we should require a revenue test only if a company is unable
to calculate public float.
Several comment letters opposed increasing the public float ceiling to a level
higher than $75 million.82 One comment letter explained that because smaller companies
typically do not have a large analyst following, financial information provided by the
company takes on greater importance in communicating results to investors.83 Another
letter noted that to balance protecting investors and promoting capital formation by small
businesses, “reduced” disclosures should be limited to those public companies with
relatively limited and less complex operations.84 Most comment letters, however,
supported a higher public float ceiling than $75 million.85 Some of these comment letters
argued that many companies with a public float greater than $75 million are still quite
small. Several commenters suggested that the Commission provide scaled regulation to

companies with up to $787 million in equity market capitalization, as they seemed to
believe the Advisory Committee had recommended.86
We are adopting, as proposed, a definition for “smaller reporting companies” that
requires companies to have a public float of less than $75 million. We believe this
standard is appropriately scaled in that it reduces costs to smaller companies caused by
unnecessary information requirements, consistent with investor protection.
As adopted, the definition will make eligibility for smaller reporting company
status contingent solely on public float for most companies. Alternatively, for companies
that are unable to calculate public float, we are, as proposed, providing a revenue test. If
a company has no common equity outstanding or no market price for its outstanding
common equity exists at the time of its eligibility determination, the company would
qualify as a smaller reporting company if it had less than $50 million in revenues in the
last fiscal year. This is a departure from the dual eligibility test under the Regulation S-B
system, which required separate calculations under public float and annual revenues. By
eliminating the revenue test for most companies, the new definition of smaller reporting
company simplifies and streamlines the definition while expanding the number of
companies eligible to qualify.

86

The Advisory Committee recommended extending the Commission’s scaled disclosure regime to
the lowest 6% of total U.S. equity market capitalization, which would have included companies
with less than $787 million in market capitalization as of March 31 and June 10, 2005. But the
Advisory Committee only identified the rules on form and content of financial statements in Item
310 of Regulation S-B as appropriate for application to that category of companies. The Advisory
Committee recommended extending the Commission’s other scaled disclosure rules, covering
disclosure and reporting, to companies in the lowest 1% of market capitalization, which, as
explained in the Proposing Release at page 16 [72 FR 39673], is essentially the same group and
proposal contained in the Proposing Release—reporting companies with less than $75 million in
public equity float—which we are adopting with few changes today. As calculated from data
obtained from Thomson Financial (Datastream), the overlap between reporting companies with
$128 million in market capitalization and reporting companies with $75 million in public float is
approximately 98%.

36




As adopted, Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K will set forth the definition for “smaller
reporting company.” We are further streamlining the definition and clarifying technical
inconsistencies in the Proposing Release. We are also modifying the proposed
introduction of Item 10, which indicated that smaller reporting companies would be
permitted to choose to comply with either the requirements applicable to smaller
reporting companies or the requirements applicable to other companies. Companies may
make a choice on most of the scaled disclosure item requirements, unless the
requirements for smaller reporting companies specify that smaller reporting companies
must comply with the smaller reporting company requirements.87 If the item requirement
does not require specific compliance, then the smaller reporting company will be
permitted to choose scaled or standard disclosure requirements.
1.

Eligibility and Exclusions

Currently, under Item 10 of Regulation S-B, small business issuer eligibility is
limited to U.S. and Canadian issuers. This has been the case since 1992, when we
adopted Regulation S-B and its associated forms and maintained eligibility for small
business issuer status for Canadian companies because these companies had been able to
use the Form SB-2 precursor, Form S-18. As adopted, we are expanding eligibility for
smaller reporting company status to non-U.S. companies using domestic company forms.
Foreign companies will qualify as smaller reporting companies if they are eligible to file
on a form that permits disclosure based on the standards for smaller reporting companies,
such as Forms S-1, S-3, S-4, 10-Q, and 10-K. Companies filing on forms available only

87

See the discussion of Item 404 at the end of Part III.C.2.

37




to “foreign private issuers,” such as Forms F-1, F-3, F-4, and 20-F, will be ineligible for
the smaller reporting company scaled disclosure requirements.
Several commenters objected to the proposal requiring that Canadian and other
foreign private issuers provide financial statements prepared according to U.S. GAAP if
they want to use the scaled rules available to smaller reporting companies, which they
may use only if they file on a form available to U.S. domestic companies. Generally,
these comment letters stated that the proposals would eliminate an accommodation
already enjoyed by Canadian companies filing on Form SB-2. Currently, Canadian
companies are permitted to provide Canadian GAAP financial statements that are
reconciled to U.S. GAAP on domestic forms. Some of the comment letters urged that we
consider allowing all foreign private issuers to provide their own country’s GAAP with
U.S. GAAP reconciliation.
To the extent that a foreign company qualifies as a smaller reporting company, it
may make filings with us on forms available to domestic U.S. companies if it presents
financial statements pursuant to U.S. GAAP. We continue to believe that because we are
extending eligibility for scaled disclosure on domestic forms to all foreign issuers, it is
important to require that this significantly larger group of foreign filers provide financial
data in accordance with U.S. GAAP on domestic forms at this time. Other than in limited
situations, foreign filers using domestic forms are required to prepare their financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Unlike our filing forms that are specifically
designed for foreign private issuers that permit the use of financial statements prepared in
accordance with bases of accounting other than U.S. GAAP so long as U.S. GAAP
reconciling information is presented, the disclosure and other requirements under our

38




domestic filing forms do not contemplate the use of accounting principles other than U.S.
GAAP. We believe eligible foreign registrants that choose to avail themselves of the
option to provide scaled disclosure should comply fully with the scaled disclosure and
financial statement presentation requirements applicable to domestic issuers.88 Finally,
the regulatory scheme for foreign private issuers on the “F” forms is specifically tailored
to address their special circumstances, and we believe the scheme provides the
accommodations most useful to these companies.
We will continue to exclude investment companies, including business
development companies, and asset-backed issuers from eligibility for scaled treatment
under our rules for smaller reporting companies. We requested comment on these
exclusions and received none.
2.

Determination Dates

The smaller reporting company determination dates we are adopting today are
based on three categories of companies: reporting companies with a public float, nonreporting companies filing a registration statement, probably an initial registration
statement, under either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and reporting or nonreporting companies without a public float.89 We are amending the definition of smaller
reporting company to remove the reference to an issuer having “no significant public
common equity outstanding,” based on a commenter’s belief that it was confusing.
Instead, the definition will indicate that in the case of an issuer whose public float as
88

We have published a concept release on whether U.S. companies should be permitted to use
International Financial Reporting Standards as published by the International Accounting
Standards Board in their filings with the Commission. If we proceed with proposed rules in this
area, we may consider the impact of any proposal on filers that use scaled disclosure. See Release
No. 33-8831 (Aug. 7, 2007) [72 FR 45600].

89

See new Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K.

39




calculated under the definition was zero, most likely because the issuer had no public
common equity outstanding or no market price for its common equity existed, the issuer
must have had annual revenues of less than $50 million in its last fiscal year.
In the case of a reporting company, we are requiring the same public float
calculation currently used to determine accelerated filer status, $75 million in public float
computed by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of shares of its voting and
non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates by the price at which the common
equity was last sold, or the average of the bid and asked prices of common equity in the
principal market for the common equity.
a.

Reporting Companies

To determine smaller reporting company eligibility, reporting companies will
follow the accelerated filer determination date in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act ―
the last business day of a company’s second fiscal quarter.90 We believe this approach
simplifies regulation and promotes consistency and uniformity with current Commission
rules. The public float of a reporting company will be calculated by using the price at
which the shares of its common equity were last sold or the average of the bid and asked
prices of such shares in the principal market for the shares as of the last business day of
the company’s second fiscal quarter, multiplied by the number of outstanding shares held
by non-affiliates. We are adopting, as proposed, a rule providing that if a reporting
company determines it qualifies as a larger reporting company rather than a smaller
reporting company on the last day of its second fiscal quarter, it will be required to
comply with the larger company disclosure standards when it files its first quarterly

report in the fiscal year following the fiscal year of the determination date. We are
permitting larger reporting companies, however, to opt for the scaled disclosure
requirements beginning with the Form 10-Q covering the second fiscal quarter
corresponding to the measurement date establishing eligibility as a smaller reporting
company.91
b.

Non-Reporting Companies Filing an Initial Registration Statement

Companies determining eligibility in connection with the filing of their initial
registration statement with the Commission will have to choose a date within 30 days of
filing to determine eligibility.92 Under Regulation S-B, we had required companies to
choose a public float calculation during a 60-day window before the filing. We believe
requiring a 30-day window will lead to more accuracy and less uncertainty for filers,
Commission staff, and investors.
The calculation methodology we are adopting for non-reporting companies varies
slightly from the Regulation S-B standard we are rescinding. The Regulation S-K
standards will require computing public float based on three components:
•	 Estimated offering price per share at the time of filing the registration
statement;
•	 Number of shares of common stock outstanding that are held by nonaffiliates before the offering; and

91

See Section III.E.2.d below, explaining how a company enters and exits the smaller reporting
company disclosure status.

92

See new Item 10(f)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K

41




•	 Number of shares of common stock to be sold at the estimated offering
price.
As adopted, the rule will require that non-reporting companies base the
calculation on the estimated number of registered shares for offering to the public. For
example, as we illustrated in the Proposing Release, a company that registers 7,000,000
shares in its initial public offering will be required to add that number to the total number
of shares held by non-affiliates before the offering. If a company has 25,000,000 shares
of common stock outstanding held by non-affiliates before the offering, it would add the
7,000,000 and 25,000,000 shares of common stock. The result would mean that the
32,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding would be multiplied by the estimated
offering price per share in the initial public offering.
One commenter raised questions regarding the proposed method of calculation.93
This commenter noted that the estimated public offering price and the number of shares
being offered tends to change during the time between the initial filing of the registration
statement and the final prospectus. The uncertainty raised by the final estimated public
offering price and number of shares being offered caused the commenter to question
whether an issuer would be required to switch midway through the process from using
smaller reporting company disclosure standards to using more extensive regular
disclosure standards. Conversely, this commenter noted that if the price range and/or the
number of shares being offered decreased, the issuer will have satisfied a more extensive
disclosure standard than it turns out it was required to satisfy.

93

See Letter from ABA.

42




We considered these comments, and believe it is appropriate to provide initial
public offering registrants the option to recalculate their public float at the time the
company completes the initial public offering. Our intention in providing this flexibility
is to permit (but not require) these issuers to recalculate their eligibility based on the
results of the initial public offering for purposes of filing the next periodic report. For
example, if an issuer files an initial public offering registration statement under the
Securities Act based on the larger company Regulation S-K item requirements but then
determines after the close of the initial public offering that its public float is below $75
million, then this issuer would be a smaller reporting company and would be eligible to
provide scaled disclosure in the first periodic report due after the initial public offering
registration statement was declared effective.94
To address the commenter’s concern that a smaller reporting company would be
required to transition its disclosure to the larger company requirements if its public float
rose above $75 million during the pre-effective stage of the filing, we are clarifying that
this would not be the case if the issuer made a bona fide eligibility determination at the
time it filed the initial public offering registration statement. The issuer will continue to
be a smaller reporting company until its next annual determination date – the end of its
second fiscal quarter.
With regard to a company’s initial registration statement under the Exchange Act
covering a class of securities, the company would calculate its public float as of a date
within a 30-day window of the registration statement being filed. Because such an
Exchange Act registration statement would not directly affect the issuer’s public float, if

94

See new Item 10(f)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

43




an issuer that files such an Exchange Act registration statement does not have a public
float or its public float cannot be calculated because there is no market price for the
issuer’s equity securities, the issuer’s eligibility for the scaled disclosure would be based
on its revenue, as proposed.95
c. 	

Alternative Revenue Test for Reporting and Non-Reporting
Companies

As we stated in the Proposing Release, situations may arise in which a reporting
company would be unable to calculate public float because it has no public common
equity outstanding or no market price for its common equity exists. As adopted, the
definition provides a third eligibility category to qualify for smaller reporting company
status – companies unable to calculate a public float. To qualify as smaller reporting
companies, this group of companies will be required to have annual revenues of less than
$50 million during the last fiscal year before filing the registration statement.96
d.

Entering and Exiting Smaller Reporting Company Status

The rules we are adopting on entering and exiting smaller reporting company status
in Item 10 of Regulation S-K are less restrictive than the Regulation S-B requirements of
Item 10. Item 10 of Regulation S-B currently requires issuers to calculate eligibility
based on public float and revenue levels for two consecutive fiscal years. The Regulation
S-B system had a significantly longer transition period to enter or exit the smaller
company disclosure system.
We are adopting transition rules for entering and exiting smaller reporting company
status that track the accelerated filer definition. The Proposing Release suggested that the

95

See new Item 10(f)(1)(iii) of Regulation S-K.

96

Id.

44




accelerated filer transition rules were the same as the smaller reporting company
transition requirements to move back and forth from larger company disclosure standards
to smaller reporting company standards. One comment letter requested clarification,
pointing out that accelerated filers are required to change to their new status when
determining the due date of the annual report covering the year of the status change, but,
as proposed, the smaller reporting company determination would not take effect until the
first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year.
As adopted, the rules provide that a larger reporting company that determines it is
a smaller reporting company as of the last business day of its most recently completed
second fiscal quarter is permitted to transition to the scaled disclosure requirements in the
Form 10-Q quarterly report corresponding to the determination date’s second fiscal
quarter rather than, as proposed, the following fiscal year’s first quarterly report. A
smaller reporting company required to transition to the larger reporting system after its
determination date calculation will not be required to satisfy the larger reporting company
disclosure requirements until the first quarter after the determination date fiscal year.97
To illustrate, a larger reporting company with a fiscal year end of December 31,
2008 that qualified as a smaller reporting company on the last business day of its most
recently completed second fiscal quarter in 2008 would be able to provide scaled
disclosure beginning with the Form 10-Q for the same second fiscal quarter in which the
company determined its eligibility, which would be due in August 2008. Conversely, a
smaller reporting company with a fiscal year end of December 31, 2008 that is required
to transition out of the scaled disclosure system into the larger company disclosure

97

See new Item 10(f)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K.

45




system will be required to do so beginning with the Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter
of 2009, which would be due in May 2009.
As adopted, once an issuer fails to qualify for smaller company status, it will
remain unqualified unless it determines that its public float, as calculated in accordance
with the definition, was less than $50 million as of the last business day of its second
fiscal quarter. Where an issuer does not have a public float or no public market for its
common equity securities exists and it has less than $50 million in revenue, it will qualify
to use the scaled disclosure item requirements until it exceeds $50 million in annual
revenue. Once such an issuer fails to qualify as a smaller reporting company because its
revenues exceed $50 million, that issuer will not become eligible for smaller reporting
company status until it has annual revenues of less than $40 million in its last fiscal
year.98

Indexing for Inflation

Many comment letters favored the inflation adjustments to the public float levels
and revenue ceilings in the definition of smaller reporting company, but noted that the
accelerated filer definition also should be indexed in order to keep these two categories
aligned. We are not adopting the indexing proposal, but will consider whether these
suggestions should be the subject of a future rulemaking project to collectively index
several thresholds in current Commission rules.

Eliminating Transitional Small Business Issuer Format

98

See new Item 10(f)(2)(iii) of Regulation S-K. 17 CFR 229.10(f)(2).

99

In addition to the matters discussed in this release, we are amending a number of rules to eliminate
references to Regulation S-B and the SB forms and to make other technical changes, such as
providing the Commission’s current mailing address.

46




We are eliminating the transitional small business issuer format, as proposed. No
commenters objected to this proposal.
3.

Checking the “Smaller Reporting Company” Box

A company that qualifies as a smaller reporting company based on the appropriate
eligibility test under the definition will be required to check the “smaller reporting
company” box on the registration statement or periodic report filed, whether or not it
chooses to rely on the scaled disclosure standards of the amended Regulation S-K
requirements. Several comment letters supported this proposal.100
IV.

Compliance Dates
Transition for Current Small Business Issuers. We are providing current small

business issuers the option to file their next annual report for a fiscal year ending on or
after December 15, 2007 on either Form 10-KSB or Form 10-K. A small business issuer
may continue to file its periodic reports using Regulation S-B and the “SB” forms until
its next annual report is filed. After a small business issuer files that next annual report,
subsequent periodic reports must be filed on a form that does not have the “SB”
designation. This will provide an optional transition period for companies that were
small business issuers as of the effective date.
As a result of this transition period, Regulation S-B, Form 10-QSB, and Form
10-KSB need to be maintained while eligible small business issuers may continue to use
them. Accordingly, while most of the amendments are effective on
February 4, 2008, Form 10-QSB will not be removed until October 31,
2008 and Regulation S-B and Form 10-KSB will not be removed until March 15, 2009.
100

See, e.g., Letters from CAQ and ABA.

47




We are making numerous changes to rules and forms to implement these rule
amendments, including replacing references to small business issuers with references to
smaller reporting companies. During the optional transition period, small business
issuers have the same reporting obligations as they had before these rule amendments,
except to the extent that they voluntarily move to the new smaller reporting company
system before being required to do so.
The “SB” Securities Act and Exchange Act registration statement forms, SB-1,
SB-2, and 10-SB, will be rescinded on the effective date. Companies filing a registration
statement after this date will be required to file on the appropriate form without an “SB”
designation. If a registration statement was filed on an “SB” form before the effective
date, and the company seeks to amend it after the effective date, the company must file
the amendment on a correct form without an “SB” designation, but may continue to use
the disclosure format and content based on the “SB” form until six months after the
effective date.101
General Transition Provisions. Companies that qualify as smaller reporting
companies after the effective date, whether or not they currently are small business
issuers, will have the option to comply with the scaled disclosure item requirements for
smaller reporting companies in their registration statements and periodic reports filed
after the effective date. To determine their status after the effective date, reporting
companies will refer to their most recent second fiscal quarter to calculate public float. In
these cases, reporting companies have already calculated public float for purposes of

101

For example, a company that filed on Form SB-2 before the effective date would be required to
file any pre- or post- effective amendments on Form S-1, but would be able to maintain the item
requirement format of its Form SB-2 for up to six months after the effective date.

48

determining accelerated filer status and, therefore, no additional computation is
necessary. Current small business issuers will be deemed to qualify as smaller reporting
companies and need not make this calculation. Companies that recently became
reporting companies before the effective date, but have not yet had a completed second
fiscal quarter, will base eligibility on the public float calculated after the initial public
offering. In all cases, companies that qualify for smaller reporting company status will
continue to have this status until they make their annual determination at the end of the
second fiscal quarter.
V.

Paperwork Reduction Act
A.

Background

The amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the
meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”).102 As discussed in the
Proposing Release, we submitted a request for approval of the “collection of information”
requirements contained in the proposed amendments to the Office of Management and
Budget in accordance with the PRA.103 Some of the revisions that we are making to the
original proposal affect these collections of information, but the revisions do not affect
the burden estimates that we submitted to the OMB in connection with the Proposing
Release. The titles of the collections of information are:104
(1) “Regulation S-B” (OMB Control No. 3235-0417);
(2) “Regulation S-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0071);
102

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

103

44 U.S.C. 3507(d); 5 CFR 1320.11.

104

The paperwork burden from Regulation S-K and S-B is imposed through the forms that are subject
to the requirements in those regulations and is reflected in the analysis of those forms. To avoid a
Paperwork Reduction Act inventory reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative
convenience, we assign a one-hour burden to Regulations S-K and S-B.

(21) “Form SE” (OMB Control No. 3235-0327).
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to,
a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
The hours and costs associated with preparing disclosure, filing information
required by forms, and retaining records constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed

50




by collection of information requirements. The information collections related to annual,
periodic, and current reports and registration statements will be mandatory for larger
reporting companies; some of the requirements, however, will be voluntary for smaller
reporting companies. There is no mandatory retention period for the information
disclosed, and the information disclosed will be made publicly available on the
Commission’s EDGAR filing system or in the Commission’s public reference room in
the case of a Form 1-A or Form SE filing.
For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, as adopted, the burden changes are
insignificant for companies that currently meet the small business issuer definition. We
did not receive any comment letters providing data or other information concerning legal
or accounting costs that would cause us to change our view.
We adopted existing Regulation S-B to provide an integrated disclosure system
for small business issuers and Regulation S-K to provide an integrated disclosure system
for larger reporting companies. Forms SB-1, SB-2, S-1, S-3, S-4, S-8, and S-11 are
registration statements that are prepared by eligible issuers to provide investors with the
information they need to make informed investment decisions in registered offerings.
Form 1-A is the form required when a non-reporting company seeks to use the
Regulation A exemption from the Securities Act. Regulation A is a conditional small
issues exemption available to eligible issuers. Forms 10, 10-SB, 10-K, 10-KSB, 8-K,
8-A, 10-Q, 10-QSB, and 11-K are forms that set forth disclosure requirements for
companies filing reports with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act. Finally,
Form SE is a notice to the Commission by an EDGAR electronic filer that it is filing
paper format exhibits.

51




Consistent with the information that we previously submitted to the OMB we
estimate that the total increase in burden hours for Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 10,
Form S-1, and Form S-11 will be 7,857,948 and that the total increase in cost will be
$1,114,044,563. These increases are offset by the total decrease in burden hours for
Form 10-KSB, Form 10-QSB, Form 10-SB, Form SB-1, and Form SB-2 of 7,853,542.5
burden hours and a total decrease in cost of $1,108,787,363. The net difference between
the increase and decrease is an increase of 4,405.5 burden hours and a cost of
$5,257,200.105 The net increase of 4,405.5 burden hours and costs of $5,257,200 is
outweighed by the possible decrease of 356,290 burden hours and costs of $47,479,000
for the 1,581 newly eligible smaller reporting companies.
The table below sets forth our current hourly and cost burden estimates for Forms
10-K, 10-Q, 10, S-1, and S-11 after these amendments.106

As explained in the Proposing Release, the net difference arises primarily from the increased
burden on real estate companies that previously could use Form SB-2, but under these
amendments would now be required to use Form S-11, the form tailored to issuers in the real
estate industry.

B.

Summary of Comment Letters and Revisions to the Proposals

We requested comment on the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis contained in the
Proposing Release. One commenter107 stated that the substitution of the Regulation S-K
disclosure framework would only be beneficial to small issuers if there were no increase
in legal and accounting costs. The commenter noted that the Commission does not
guarantee that moving the current Regulation S-B disclosure requirements into
Regulation S-K will be more cost effective. The commenter also disagreed with the
Commission’s average costs estimates, stating that costs vary between New York City
and smaller communities throughout the country. Several other commenters108 raised
similar concerns that costs may increase as a result of these proposals. None of these
commenters, however, provided any data or other information to show that legal and
accounting costs will increase.
Our estimates of the average number of hours each entity spends completing the
affected forms, allocation of burden between outside counsel and internal personnel, and
the average hourly rate for outside securities counsel were obtained by contacting a
number of law firms and other persons regularly involved in completing the forms and
reflect regional variances.
Commenters who raise a concern about the transition from Regulation S-B and
the “SB” forms to Regulation S-K and the “SK” forms wanted us to consider a phase-in
period. The amendments, as adopted, will allow a former “SB” filer a choice to file its

107

Commerce), and Prof. James Angel.

53




first annual report on Form 10-K or Form 10-KSB during the transition period, but
thereafter it will no longer be able to use the “SB” forms. For example, after the effective
date of these amendments, an eligible calendar year company will be able to choose to
file its first annual report on Form 10-K or Form 10-KSB. An eligible non-calendar
company may file its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or Form 10-QSB until its next
annual report due after the effective date of the amendments. That next annual report
may be filed on Form 10-K or Form 10-KSB, but thereafter the company may no longer
use the “SB” forms.
We also received comment letters109 expressing concern that legal and accounting
costs will increase as a result of the proposals. We do not believe that legal or accounting
costs should increase since, small business issuers generally will be providing the same
disclosure as currently filed. In the case of a newly eligible smaller reporting company
that previously filed under Regulation S-K using “SK” forms, the disclosure burden will
decrease if the company elects to use the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting
companies. Otherwise the issuer may also file roughly the same information as it does
currently. The Commission is providing an index to the scaled disclosure requirements in
new Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K and plans to publish a brochure to assist smaller
reporting companies in transitioning to the new scaled disclosure requirements.
In response to these comments, we decided to revise four items that were part of
the original proposal.

109

See Letters from IASBDA, SBA Office of Advocacy, Center for Capital Markets (U.S. Chamber
of Commerce), and Prof. James Angel.

54




First, we are persuaded by the letters of the public accounting firms110 that Item
310 should be placed in a separate section within Regulation S-X, instead of creating a
new Item 310 within Regulation S-K. We agree that having all financial information
requirements within one Regulation seems logical and appropriate.
Second, several commenters111 cite the Advisory Committee’s recommendation to
require two years of balance sheets to go along with audited statements of income, cash
flows, and changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the latest two fiscal years, as
required by Regulation S-X. We have been convinced by the comment letters and the
Advisory Committee’s report that two years of balance sheets will provide investors with
valuable comparative information with minimal additional costs.
A third revision will allow a smaller reporting company to provide its financial
statements on an “a la carte” basis like the other non-financial statement disclosure items.
This revision differs from the Proposing Release, where the Commission proposed to
require a smaller reporting company to provide its financial statements on the basis of
Item 310 of Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X for an entire fiscal year, and not be
permitted to switch back and forth from one to the other in different filings within a
single fiscal year. A commenter112 pointed out that this inflexibility within the “a la
carte” system and requiring a smaller reporting company to “lock in” to one approach or
the other when it files its first Form 10-Q for a year seems contrary to the proposed “a la
carte” approach. As we proposed, if a smaller reporting company wanted to preserve the

55




option of following the smaller reporting company rules in its filings, it perhaps could not
provide the additional information required of larger companies in its first quarterly report or
risk losing the ability to use the scaled disclosure requirements for the year. As adopted, we

will allow “a la carte” disclosure for financial statements so that smaller reporting
companies can provide additional information over and above the financial disclosure
required by Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
The fourth revision requested by commenters113 is to amend Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X. Rule 3-05 provides the requirements for Financial Statements of
Businesses Acquired or to be Acquired, and paragraph (b)(2)(iv) allows issuers to omit
the financial statements for the earliest of three fiscal years required if the net revenues of
the business to be acquired are less than $25 million. We agree with the commenters that
the $25 million ceiling was related to the small business issuer definition, and since we
are creating a new definition of smaller reporting company to replace the small business
issuer definition that contains a $50 million revenue ceiling, it is appropriate to raise the
Rule 3-05 ceiling to $50 million.
For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, as adopted, the burden changes are
insignificant for companies that currently meet the small business issuer definition. We
did not receive any comment letters providing data or other information concerning legal
or accounting costs that would cause us to change our view.

Background

See Letters from Grant Thornton, KPMG, and CAQ.

56




We have adopted amendments to eliminate our “SB” forms and move the
Regulation S-B item requirements into amended Regulations S-K and S-X. The
amendments will amend all relevant rules and forms under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, and the Trust Indenture Act to replace the existing references to “small
business issuer” to reference to “smaller reporting company.” The new “smaller
reporting company” definition will replace the current “small business issuer” eligibility
standards to allow a greater number of public companies to provide disclosure based on
the scaled disclosure requirements. The new definition for smaller reporting company
will include companies with a public float of less than $75 million and will therefore be a
significant increase from the $25 million levels for public float and revenue under the
current “small business issuer” definition. For companies without a public float, we are
requiring an alternative ceiling of below $50 million in revenue in the previous year.
B.

Summary of Rules

As noted above, the amendments will eliminate the separate disclosure framework
of Regulation S-B by moving those requirements into Regulation S-K and the financial
disclosure into Regulation S-X. The new definition for “smaller reporting company” will
expand the number of filers that will qualify to provide disclosure under the scaled item
requirements of the current Regulation S-B framework. Smaller reporting companies and
non-accelerated filers will both be subject to Regulation S-K, but smaller reporting
companies will have the option to provide disclosure on an item-by-item basis according
to the scaled item requirements of amended Regulation S-K. The newly adopted
amendments will allow eligible smaller reporting companies to do the following:

57




•	 Provide three years rather than five years of business development activities,
and not be required to provide segment disclosure under amended Item 101 of
Regulation S-K;
•	 Not provide disclosure required by Items 301 and 302 relating to selected
financial data and supplementary financial information;
•	 Provide more streamlined disclosure for management’s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations found in Item 303 by
requiring only two years of analysis if the company is presenting only two
years of financial statements, instead of three years currently required of
larger companies;
•	 Provide audited balance sheets, audited statements of income, cash flows and
changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the last two fiscal years in new
Article 8 of Regulation S-X instead of an audited balance sheet as of the end
of the last two fiscal years and audited statement of income, cash flows and
changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the last three fiscal years as
required by other parts of Regulation S-X;
•	 Provide disclosure about the chief executive officer and two other highly
compensated executive officers only, rather than the information for the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three other executive officers
required of larger registrants;
•	 Not provide a Compensation Discussion and Analysis required of larger
reporting companies;

58




•	 Provide only three of the seven tables (Summary Compensation, Outstanding
Equity Awards, and Director Compensation) required of larger reporting
companies; and
•	 Not provide disclosure regarding the company’s policies and procedures for
approving related person transactions. Smaller reporting companies will be
required, however, to provide disclosure regarding a transaction where the
amount exceeds the lesser of 1% of a smaller company’s total assets or
$120,000. They also will be required to provide additional specific
information about underwriting discounts and commissions and corporate
parents. Additionally, smaller reporting companies will be required to provide
disclosure regarding promoters and certain control persons.
C.

Benefits

As discussed above, the amendments adopted today will promote regulatory
simplification by eliminating all “SB” forms and consolidating the Regulation S-B
disclosure item requirements into Regulation S-K. The integrated Regulation S-K regime
will enable a larger category of public companies to have more flexibility in tailoring
disclosure standards to fit the need of investors and the realities of their company. We
believe investors will benefit from the scaled disclosure amendments to Regulation S-K
because the amendments allow issuers to make disclosure based on the size, business
operations, and financial condition of the smaller reporting company. Allowing smaller
reporting companies to choose scaled disclosure on an item-by-item basis allows
companies to tailor their disclosure to reduce costs and thereby benefit shareholders. The
increased public float standards in the definition of smaller reporting company will allow

59




more companies the flexibility to choose between scaled item requirements such as
financial statement information and executive compensation disclosure. By doing so,
these newly eligible companies can appropriately determine the information needs of
their investors in light of the costs of providing that information. Thus, moving the
scaled disclosure requirements of Regulation S-B into Regulations S-K and S-X will
provide regulatory flexibility that gives companies the ability to allocate resources to
increased disclosure only in instances where they believe doing so would provide a
benefit to shareholders.
Eliminating the “SB” forms will mitigate any perceived notion that smaller
companies are currently reporting under a completely different and inferior disclosure
framework. If current Regulation S-B filers are inappropriately penalized by the market
for this perceived notion, as some commenters have suggested, then integrating
Regulation S-B and Regulation S-K should benefit shareholders by decreasing the
company’s cost of capital. To the extent that these amendments, eliminate the perceived
notion of an inferior disclosure framework, we believe that these amendments will
increase the benefits and in some instances, reduce the costs of being a public company
and will benefit the capital markets by encouraging private companies to consider
offerings that are registered under the Securities Act or to enter the Exchange Act
reporting system.
As amended, an integrated disclosure system for all companies filing forms using
Regulation S-K will promote efficiency because practitioners and investors will refer to
one disclosure framework. Filers and their practitioners will have one consolidated
regulation to find all relevant disclosure item requirements, which will reduce complexity

60




and improve regulatory efficiencies. Although some commenters114 were concerned that
finding the scaled disclosure provisions in Regulation S-K would be inefficient, the index
of scaled disclosure in new Item 10(f) should mitigate this concern. For some smaller
reporting companies, legal and accounting costs may decrease.
As discussed earlier in this release, we estimate that approximately 1,581 new
companies will have an opportunity to use the restructured scaled disclosure requirements
for smaller reporting companies and may experience significant burden and cost savings
if they use them.115 We assume that approximately 50% of the 1,581 companies (or 790
companies) will use the scaled disclosure requirements. For purposes of the Paperwork
Reduction Act, we estimate that these 790 smaller reporting companies may save 356,290
internal burden hours and costs in the amount of $47,479,000 by using the scaled
disclosure requirements.116
Finally, another benefit to smaller reporting companies is that by using
Registration Statement Form S-1, a company may be permitted to incorporate by
reference its previously filed periodic reports. We believe that this will result in some

114

See e.g. Letters from Grant Thornton and BDO.

115

We estimate that 1,227 companies would be newly eligible to use the scaled disclosure available
to smaller reporting companies in addition to another 354 companies that currently are eligible for
scaled disclosure but do not use it, resulting in a total of 1,581 companies. Approximately 1,227
companies have a public float between $25 and $75 million, in addition to approximately 354
companies with a public float below $25 million that currently use the “SK” forms rather than the
“SB” forms.

116

This estimate of a decrease in the compliance burden by 356,290 hours is based upon 790
responses by companies using regular Regulation S-K disclosure x 1,723 internal hours per
company = 1,361,170 hours minus 790 responses by companies x 1,272 internal hours per
company = 1,004,880 hours for smaller reporting companies and a decrease in the annual cost by
$47,479,000 (574.25 professional hours x $400 per hour = $229,700 cost per response using
regular Regulation S-K disclosure x 790 responses minus 424 professional hours X $400 per hour
= $169,600 cost per response using the scaled disclosure x 790 annual responses).

cost savings and efficiencies in preparing registration statements for smaller reporting
companies.
D.

Costs

In our view, the elimination of the “SB” forms and moving the Regulation S-B
disclosure standards into Regulation S-K and financial disclosure into Regulation S-X
will not significantly increase the costs of complying with the Commission’s rules.
The disclosure requirements will not change except in minor ways for current
small business issuers that previously filed under Regulation S-B, so we do not anticipate
any increase in costs due to the change in disclosure requirements.117
Four commenters118 stated that these proposals may have unintended
consequences, such as extra legal and accounting costs. One of these commenters119
expressed concern that moving the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-B into
Regulation S-K would only benefit small issuers if the legal and accounting costs do not
increase. The commenter did not provide any data or information to support its position
that costs could increase. The amount of disclosure a former small business issuer will
provide on the “SK” forms should not increase unless the issuer chooses to provide
additional disclosure above the required disclosure. We have added a heading entitled
“Smaller Reporting Companies” to Items where scaled disclosure is available for smaller
reporting companies. This will alleviate the concern that small issuers need guidance in

117

For current “SB” filers, we estimate the net difference of reporting under Regulation S-K will be
an increase of 4,405.5 burden hours and a cost of $5,257,200 for purposes of the Paperwork
Reduction Act.

determining what disclosure requirements apply to them.120 Thus, we do not believe that
there should be any significant additional out-of-pocket costs associated with compliance.
We recognize that some of the 1,581 companies may choose to avail themselves
of the scaled disclosure requirements when they have complied with standard Regulation
S-K previously. In addition, the amount of disclosure reviewed by the Commission’s
staff may change for these companies. The staff will now evaluate compliance with
Regulation S-K on the scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting
companies even if the company previously chose to comply with the larger company
Regulation S-K disclosure requirements. If the amount of disclosure and corresponding
SEC review under the prior reporting standard was valued by investors, using scaled
disclosure may increase a company’s cost of capital. Because the differences in smaller
and larger company disclosure standards are small, however, we believe that any such
costs will be minimal.
Investors may face additional costs in determining whether a newly eligible
smaller reporting company has changed the amount of disclosure it provides to investors
or whether the company continues to provide the maximum required disclosure.
Allowing smaller reporting companies to choose financial statement items on an “a la
carte” basis in a quarterly report may create additional costs for investors to determine
whether the company has changed the type of disclosure from quarter to quarter. Since
smaller reporting companies will be required to check a box indicating they qualify as
such, however, investors will be alerted that these issuers are eligible to use the scaled
disclosure requirements.
120

See Letter from Prof. James Angel.

63




Another possible cost is requiring Canadian issuers, who seek to use the new
scaled disclosure requirements, to provide their financial statements using U.S. GAAP
rather than home country GAAP reconciled to U.S. GAAP. Based upon the Form
10-KSB filings received from Canadian issuers on the Commission’s EDGAR filing
system we estimate that under 50 Canadian issuers will be affected by this change. This
change could increase audit costs for these companies if they chose to continue to file on
the domestic forms which will now require financial statements in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. Other cost increases could include staff training, administrative costs, and minor
transition costs.
VII. 	 Consideration of Impact on the Economy, Burden on
Competition and Promotion of Efficiency, Competition and Capital
Formation
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires us to consider the impact that any
new rule will have on competition.121 Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits us from adopting
any rule that will impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate to carry
out the purposes of the Exchange Act.
Furthermore, when engaging in rulemaking that requires us to consider or
determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, Section
2(b) of the Securities Act and Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act require the Commission
to consider whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and capital
formation.
We expect that the amendments adopted today will result in regulatory
121

15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

64




simplification and efficiency by removing the duplicative sections of Regulation S-B and
consolidating the scaled item requirements of Regulation S-B, such as executive
compensation, into amended Regulation S-K. As adopted, the financial statement
requirements for small business issuers previously found in Item 310 will be in a separate
section of Regulation S-X. As amended, Regulations S-K and S-X will consolidate these
requirements into a simplified framework applicable to all filers that are subject to the
reporting requirements of Sections 13 and 15 of the Exchange Act and companies filing
registration statements under the Securities Act. To comply with disclosure item
requirements, practitioners and companies will no longer need to refer to two disclosure
frameworks. Practitioners and companies will benefit from the ease of reference that a
single disclosure framework will provide.
It is expected that the amendments will promote capital formation for smaller
reporting companies and improve their ability to compete with larger companies for
capital. For example, we believe capital formation will be improved by providing
flexibility to more smaller reporting companies to tailor their disclosure to their investors’
needs. In addition, the costs to raise capital may be reduced to the extent compliance
costs, but not benefits, are reduced as a result of the scaled disclosure requirements. If
smaller reporting companies allocate the capital they raise and save as a result of our
scaled disclosure requirements to business development in an effective manner, these
companies will be more competitive. More companies will be able to take advantage of
more scaled disclosure item requirements, such as those contained currently in Item 310
and Item 402 of Regulation S-B. Smaller reporting companies that avail themselves of
the scaled disclosure requirements will provide tailored disclosure that may better meet

65




the needs of their investors.
VIII.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis
This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with

the Regulatory Flexibility Act.122 It relates to amendments to the rules and forms under
the Securities Act and Exchange Act, which include a new definition of “smaller
reporting company” under Regulation S-K. The new definition will expand the group of
smaller companies that qualify to provide disclosure in accordance with the scaled
requirements of the current Regulation S-B disclosure framework.
As adopted, a smaller reporting company is defined as a company that meets all
of the following criteria: is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or the
majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that was not a smaller reporting company; had a
public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently
completed second fiscal quarter; and in the case of an issuer whose public float was zero,
had annual revenues of less than $50 million during its most recently completed fiscal
year for which audited financial statements are available on the date of the filing.
The amendments also will eliminate the separate disclosure regime of
Regulation S-B by removing all related “SB” forms and merging the Regulation S-B item
requirements into Regulation S-K, except for Item 310 (Financial statements) which
move into Regulation S-X. The revisions to Regulations S-K and S-X include revising
item requirements to offer smaller reporting companies optional disclosure alternatives
that are designed to provide flexibility, cost efficiencies and regulatory simplification.

Reasons for and Objectives of Amendments

5 U.S.C. 604.

66




1. 	

The Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies
Recommended Scaled Federal Securities Regulation for Smaller
Companies

In March 2005, the Commission chartered the Advisory Committee on Smaller
Public Companies to assess the current regulatory system for smaller companies under
the federal securities laws, including the disclosure and reporting requirements applicable
to smaller companies, and to make recommendations for changes to improve regulatory
conditions for smaller companies.
After receiving public input, the Advisory Committee made three
recommendations in the disclosure area, which included making the scaled disclosure
accommodations available to small business issuers available to all microcap companies,
incorporating Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K, and incorporating Item 310 of
Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X to make the scaled financial
statement accommodations available to a much larger group of smaller companies.
2. 	

Expanding Eligibility for Smaller Company Scaled Regulation Under
Amended Regulation S-K

To make the scaled requirements of the Regulation S-B disclosure framework
applicable to many more companies, the Advisory Committee recommended revising the
definition of “small business issuer” to include a company with a higher public float
threshold than the $25 million ceiling currently required in the small business issuer
definition found in Item 10 of Regulation S-B.
Although the Advisory Committee did not recommend that we use a public float
threshold, the $75 million public float threshold adopted is based on the reference to that
number in the accelerated filer definition set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. To
maintain consistency with current regulation, we believe setting a public float threshold

67




based on the current levels established for non-accelerated filers is practical and avoids
regulatory complexity.
3.	 Integrating Substantive Requirements of Regulation S-B into Regulations
S-K and S-X
The overall goal of the rule amendments is to integrate the scaled disclosure
requirements of Regulation S-B into Regulation S-K and make these scaled disclosure
requirements available to more companies as smaller reporting companies. We believe
the amendments will:
•	 Further the goals of regulatory simplification by eliminating the current
Regulation S-B framework as a separate stand-alone disclosure standard for
the smallest reporting companies;
•	 Update the public float threshold and eliminate the revenue threshold
restriction in the current “small business issuer” definition to accommodate
many more companies that are contemplating an offering registered under the
Securities Act or entry into the Exchange Act reporting system;
•	 Streamline and modernize forms under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act by eliminating all of the “SB” forms; and
•	 Provide regulatory flexibility by permitting smaller reporting companies to
provide the same financial statement information previously found in Item
310 of Regulation S-B into Regulation S-X.
B.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comment

The initial Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis appeared in the Proposing Release.
We requested comment on any aspect of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis,
especially empirical data on the impact on small businesses.

68




In the Proposing Release we stated that the proposed elimination of Regulation
S-B and the “SB” forms will not increase significantly the costs of complying with the
Commission’s rules. While we still believe this is the case, we received four comment
letters123 expressing concern that the proposals could increase legal and accounting costs.
One of these commenters124 stated that “this type of one-size-fits-all regulation may have
unintended consequences such as extra legal and accounting costs.” Another
commenter125 stated that the proposals would not increase costs and that the backwards
incorporation by reference on Form S-1 would save burden hours and costs.
As stated above, in response to the commenters’ concerns about the transition
from Regulation S-B and the “SB” forms to Regulation S-K and the “SK” forms, we have
added a transition provision for companies that are current “SB” filers. These companies
will have the choice of filing their next annual report due after the effective date on either
a Form 10-KSB or a Form 10-K. Similarly, they may file any quarterly reports for
periods before the next annual report due on either Form 10-QSB or Form 10-Q. Reports
filed after the next annual report due may no longer be on the “SB” forms.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Amendments

The amendments will affect small entities, the securities of which are registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or that are required to file reports under Section
15(d) of the Exchange Act. The amendments also will affect small entities that file, or
have filed, a registration statement that has not yet become effective under the Securities

Act and that has not been withdrawn. Securities Act Rule 157126 and Exchange Act Rule
0-10(a)127 define an issuer to be a “small entity” for purposes of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent
fiscal year. We believe the amendments will affect some small entities. We estimate that
there are approximately 1,100 issuers that may be considered small entities.128 Further,
we estimate that virtually all of the 1,100 small entities would be below $75 million in
public equity float and will qualify for the scaled disclosure requirements.
D.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements

As adopted, moving Regulation S-B requirements into Regulations S-K and S-X
and rescinding all of the “SB” forms will shift the location of disclosure requirements and
will require smaller reporting companies to adapt to new formats in preparing their
disclosure for Form S-1. The amendments to Regulation S-K include a new definition
for smaller reporting company, which broadens the category of filers preparing disclosure
to comply with the scaled item requirements of amended Regulation S-K. Companies
with public floats between $25 and $75 million will be included in the class of filers that
is eligible to provide disclosure based on the scaled requirements of proposed revisions to
amended Regulation S-K. As adopted today, the scope and presentation of information
disclosed based on the item requirements of amended Regulations S-K and S-X will

The estimated number of reporting small entities is based on 2007 data including the
Commission’s internal computerized filing system and Thomson Financials Worldscope database.
This represents an update from the number of reporting small entities estimated in prior
rulemakings.

70




differ in a number of significant ways from the current Regulation S-K disclosure
framework. Amended Regulation S-K will allow smaller reporting companies to:
•	 Provide three years rather than five years of business development activities,
and not be required to provide segment disclosure under amended Item 101 of
Regulation S-K;
•	 Not provide disclosure required by Items 301 and 302 relating to selected
financial data and supplementary financial information;
•	 Provide more streamlined disclosure for management’s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations found in Item 303 by
requiring only two years of analysis if the company is presenting only two
years of financial statements, instead of the three years currently required of
larger companies;
•	 Provide audited balance sheets, audited statements of income, cash flows and
changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the last two fiscal years in new
Article 8 of Regulation S-X instead of an audited balance sheet as of the end
of the last two fiscal years and audited statement of income, cash flows and
changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the last three fiscal years as
required by other parts of Regulation S-X;
•	 Provide disclosure about the chief executive officer and two other highly
compensated executive officers only, rather than the information for the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three other executive officers
required of larger registrants;

71




•	 Not provide a Compensation Discussion and Analysis required of larger
reporting companies;
•	 Provide only three of the seven tables (Summary Compensation, Outstanding
Equity Awards, and Director Compensation) required of larger reporting
companies; and
Not provide disclosure regarding the company’s policies and procedures for
approving related person transactions. Smaller reporting companies will be required,
however, to provide disclosure regarding a transaction where the amount exceeds the
lesser of 1% of a smaller company’s total assets or $120,000. They also will be required
to provide additional specific information about underwriting discounts and commissions
and corporate parents. Additionally, smaller reporting companies will be required to
provide disclosure regarding promoters and certain control persons. The amendments to
Regulation S-K will not generally increase the disclosure requirements for former small
business issuers, and could decrease the disclosure required for issuers with public float
levels between $25 million and $75 million.
Amended Item 404 of Regulation S-K is the only example where it is possible
that the disclosure required for smaller reporting companies will be more extensive than
for standard Regulation S-K filers. In addition to a longer time period for required
disclosure, as discussed above, Item 404 contains a provision that requires disclosure of
transactions with related persons that exceed the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average
of the smaller reporting company’s total assets at the fiscal year end for the last two
completed fiscal years. This requirement may be more burdensome to a smaller reporting
company if 1% of total assets are less than $120,000. We believe transactions involving

72




related persons are important to disclose, especially for smaller reporting companies,
which generally have lower materiality thresholds. We believe these differences are
important for the protection of investors. This disclosure issue will only affect smaller
reporting companies that have related person transactions.
E.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider significant alternatives that
will accomplish the stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on
small entities. In connection with the proposals, we considered the following
alternatives:
(a) establishing different compliance or reporting requirements which take into
account the resources available to smaller entities;
(b) the clarification, consolidation or simplification of disclosure for small
entities;
(c) use of performance standards rather than design standards; and
(d) exempting smaller entities from coverage of the disclosure requirements or
any part thereof.
As adopted, our amendments are intended to maintain current disclosure
standards for small entities while further expanding the scope of eligibility for companies
that elect to comply with the scaled disclosure item requirements currently set forth in
Regulation S-B. These changes do not exempt smaller entities from coverage of the
disclosure requirements; rather, they provide a greater number of smaller reporting
companies the choice to provide scaled disclosure within Regulations S-K and S-X.

73




As adopted, the new definition for smaller reporting company will eliminate the
current $25 million revenue threshold and increase the public float threshold requirement
up to $75 million from the $25 million level currently set forth in the small business
issuer definition of Regulation S-B. We believe that the $75 million threshold will
appropriately result in reduced costs to smaller companies caused by unnecessary
information requirements, consistent with investor protection. This is also consistent
with our current regulatory system.
We considered alternatives such as including a revenue cap in the new definition
of smaller reporting company, but currently believe that only requiring less than $75
million in public float is preferable, given its ease of reference and consistency with
current rules under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. We also seriously
considered the comment letters submitted by the public. Some of the letters urged the
Commission to use market capitalization instead of public float as a metric to determine
eligibility as a smaller reporting company, but again, use of a float test provides more
regulatory consistency.
As adopted, we will consolidate, clarify, and simplify our disclosure requirements
by moving Regulation S-B into Regulations S-K and S-X. These amendments include a
new definition of smaller reporting company, which greatly expands the number of small
entities that will qualify to provide disclosure based on the scaled disclosure item
requirements of the current Regulation S-B framework. We considered maintaining the
Regulation S-B framework and making it available to many more companies, but we
were not convinced by commenters that the Commission should not eliminate Regulation
S-B and the “SB” forms. We still believe a single disclosure framework will be more

74




cost effective and more efficient. The elimination of the “SB” forms will result in
regulatory simplification for smaller entities by requiring all registrants to rely on one set
of forms, such as Forms S-1, S-3, 10-K and 10-Q. These forms will include scaled item
requirements for smaller reporting companies under the amendments adopted today for
Regulations S-K and S-X.
Finally, we considered the use of performance rather than design standards but
concluded that, although we allow some tailoring, investors need a basic level of
consistency, uniformity and comparability among issuers in order to make appropriate
investment decisions.

§ 210.8-01 Preliminary Notes to Article 8.
Sections 210.8-01 to 210.8-08 shall be applicable to financial statements filed for
smaller reporting companies. These section are not applicable to financial statements
prepared for the purposes of Item 17 or Item 18 of Form 20-F.
Note 1 to § 210.8: Financial statements of a smaller reporting company, as
defined by § 229.10(f)(1) of this chapter, its predecessors or any businesses to which the
smaller reporting company is a successor shall be prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Note 2 to § 210.8: Smaller reporting companies electing to prepare their financial
statements with the form and content required in this article need not apply the other form
and content requirements in Regulation S-X with the exception of the following:
a.

The report and qualifications of the independent accountant shall comply with

the requirements of Article 2 of this part;
b. The description of accounting policies shall comply with Article 4–08(n) of
this part; and

80




c. Smaller reporting companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities shall
follow the financial accounting and reporting standards specified in Article 4–10 of this
part with respect to such activities.
To the extent that Article 11–01 of this part (Pro Forma Presentation
Requirements) offers enhanced guidelines for the preparation, presentation and disclosure
of pro forma financial information, smaller reporting companies may wish to consider
these items.
Note 3 to § 210.8: Financial statements for a subsidiary of a smaller reporting
company that issues securities guaranteed by the smaller reporting company or
guarantees securities issued by the smaller reporting company must be presented as
required by § 210.3-10, except that the periods presented are those required by §
210.8-02.

Note 5 to § 210.8: The Commission, where consistent with the protection of
investors, may permit the omission of one or more of the financial statements or the
substitution of appropriate statements of comparable character. The Commission by
informal written notice may require the filing of other financial statements where
necessary or appropriate.
Note 6 to § 210.8: Section 210.4-01(a)(3) shall apply to the preparation of
financial statements of smaller reporting companies.

81




§ 210.8-02 Annual financial statements.
Smaller reporting companies shall file an audited balance sheet as of the end of
each of the most recent two fiscal years, or as of a date within 135 days if the issuer has
existed for a period of less than one fiscal year, and audited statements of income, cash
flows and changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the two fiscal years preceding the
date of the most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as the registrant has
been in business).
§ 210.8-03 Interim financial statements.
Interim financial statements may be unaudited; however, before filing, interim
financial statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10–Q (§ 249.308(a) of this
chapter) must be reviewed by an independent public accountant using professional
standards and procedures for conducting such reviews, as established by generally
accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or supplemented by the Commission. If,
in any filing, the issuer states that interim financial statements have been reviewed by an
independent public accountant, a report of the accountant on the review must be filed
with the interim financial statements. Interim financial statements shall include a balance
sheet as of the end of the issuer’s most recent fiscal quarter, a balance sheet as of the end
of the preceding fiscal year, and income statements and statements of cash flows for the
interim period up to the date of such balance sheet and the comparable period of the
preceding fiscal year.
(a) Condensed format. Interim financial statements may be condensed as
follows:

82




(1) Balance sheets should include separate captions for each balance sheet
component presented in the annual financial statements that represents 10% or more of
total assets. Cash and retained earnings should be presented regardless of relative
significance to total assets. Registrants that present a classified balance sheet in their
annual financial statements should present totals for current assets and current liabilities.
(2) Income statements should include net sales or gross revenue, each cost and
expense category presented in the annual financial statements that exceeds 20% of sales
or gross revenues, provision for income taxes, discontinued operations, extraordinary
items and cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles or practices. (Financial
institutions should substitute net interest income for sales for purposes of determining
items to be disclosed.) Dividends per share should be presented.
(3) Cash flow statements should include cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities as well as cash at the beginning and end of each period and the
increase or decrease in such balance.
(4) Additional line items may be presented to facilitate the usefulness of the
interim financial statements, including their comparability with annual financial
statements.
(b) Disclosure required and additional instructions as to content.
(1) Footnotes. Footnote and other disclosures should be provided as needed for
fair presentation and to ensure that the financial statements are not misleading.
(2) Material subsequent events and contingencies. Disclosure must be provided
of material subsequent events and material contingencies notwithstanding disclosure in
the annual financial statements.

83




(3) Significant equity investees. Sales, gross profit, net income (loss) from
continuing operations and net income must be disclosed for equity investees that
constitute 20% or more of a registrant’s consolidated assets, equity or income from
continuing operations.
(4) Significant dispositions and purchase business combinations. If a significant
disposition or purchase business combination has occurred during the most recent interim
period and the transaction required the filing of a Form 8–K (§ 249.308 of this chapter),
pro forma data must be presented that reflects revenue, income from continuing
operations, net income and income per share for the current interim period and the
corresponding interim period of the preceding fiscal year as though the transaction
occurred at the beginning of the periods.
(5) Material accounting changes. Disclosure must be provided of the date and
reasons for any material accounting change. The registrant's independent accountant must
provide a letter in the first Form 10–Q (§ 249.308a of this chapter) filed after the change
indicating whether or not the change is to a preferable method. Disclosure must be
provided of any retroactive change to prior period financial statements, including the
effect of any such change on income and income per share.
(6) Development stage companies. A registrant in the development stage must
provide cumulative financial information from inception.
Instruction 1 to § 210.8-03: Where Article 8 is applicable to a Form 10–Q and the
interim period is more than one quarter, income statements must also be provided for the
most recent interim quarter and the comparable quarter of the preceding fiscal year.

84




Instruction 2 to § 210.8-03: Interim financial statements must include all
adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary in order to make the
financial statements not misleading. An affirmative statement that the financial
statements have been so adjusted must be included with the interim financial statements.
§ 210.8-04 Financial statements of businesses acquired or to be acquired.
(a) If a business combination accounted for as a “purchase” has occurred or is
probable, financial statements of the business acquired or to be acquired shall be
furnished for the periods specified in paragraph (c) of this section:
(1) The term “purchase” encompasses the purchase of an interest in a business
accounted for by the equity method.
(2) Acquisitions of a group of related businesses that are probable or that have
occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year end for which audited financial statements of
the issuer have been filed shall be treated as if they are a single business combination for
purposes of this section. The required financial statements of related businesses may be
presented on a combined basis for any periods they are under common control or
management. A group of businesses is deemed to be related if:
(i) They are under common control or management;
(ii) The acquisition of one business is conditioned on the acquisition of each other
business; or
(iii) Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.
(3) Annual financial statements required by this rule shall be audited. The form
and content of the financial statements shall be in accordance with §§ 210.8-02 and 8-03.

85




(b) The periods for which financial statements are to be presented are determined
by comparison of the most recent annual financial statements of the business acquired or
to be acquired and the smaller reporting company’s most recent annual financial
statements filed at or before the date of acquisition to evaluate each of the following
conditions:
(1) Compare the smaller reporting company’s investments in and advances to the
acquiree to the total consolidated assets of the smaller reporting company as of the end of
the most recently completed fiscal year.
(2) Compare the smaller reporting company’s proportionate share of the total
assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the acquiree to the total consolidated assets of
the smaller reporting company as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year.
(3) Compare the smaller reporting company’s equity in the income from
continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principles of the acquiree to such consolidated income of the
smaller reporting company for the most recently completed fiscal year.
Computational note to § 210.8-04(b): For purposes of making the prescribed
income test the following guidance should be applied: If income of the smaller reporting
company and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10
percent lower than the average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average
income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss years should be
omitted for purposes of computing average income.
(c)(1) If none of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section exceeds
20%, financial statements are not required. If any of the conditions exceed 20%, but

86




none exceeds 40%, financial statements shall be furnished for the most recent fiscal year
and any interim periods specified in § 210.8-03. If any of the conditions exceed 40%,
financial statements shall be furnished for the two most recent fiscal years and any
interim periods specified in § 210.8-03.
(2) The separate audited balance sheet of the acquired business is not required
when the smaller reporting company’s most recent audited balance sheet filed is for a
date after the acquisition was consummated.
(3) If the aggregate impact of individually insignificant businesses acquired since
the date of the most recent audited balance sheet filed for the registrant exceeds 50%,
financial statements covering at least the substantial majority of the businesses acquired
shall be furnished. Such financial statements shall be for the most recent fiscal year and
any interim periods specified in § 210.8-03.
(4) Registration statements not subject to the provisions of § 230.419 of this
chapter (Regulation C) and proxy statements need not include separate financial
statements of the acquired or to be acquired business if it does not meet or exceed any of
the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section at the 50 percent level, and
either:
(i) The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or
(ii) The effective date of the registration statement, or mailing date in the case of a
proxy statement, is no more than 74 days after consummation of the business
combination, and the financial statements have not been filed previously by the registrant.
(5) An issuer that omits from its initial registration statement financial statements
of a recently consummated business combination pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this

87




section shall furnish those financial statements and any pro forma information specified
by § 210.8-05 under cover of Form 8–K (§249.308 of this chapter) no later than 75 days
after consummation of the acquisition.
(d) If the smaller reporting company made a significant business acquisition after
the latest fiscal year end and filed a report on Form 8–K, which included audited financial
statements of such acquired business for the periods required by paragraph (c) of this
section and the pro forma financial information required by § 210.8-05, the determination
of significance may be made by using pro forma amounts for the latest fiscal year in the
report on Form 8–K rather than by using the historical amounts of the registrant. The
tests may not be made by “annualizing” data.
(e) If the business acquired or to be acquired is a foreign business, financial
statements of the business meeting the requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F (§ 249.220f
of this chapter) will satisfy this section.
§ 210.8-05 Pro forma financial information.
(a) Pro forma information showing the effects of the acquisition shall be furnished
if financial statements of a business acquired or to be acquired are presented.
(b) Pro forma statements should be condensed, in columnar form showing pro
forma adjustments and results, and should include the following:
(1) If the transaction was consummated during the most recent fiscal year or
subsequent interim period, pro forma statements of income reflecting the combined
operations of the entities for the latest fiscal year and interim period, if any; or
(2) If consummation of the transaction has occurred or is probable after the date
of the most recent balance sheet required by § 210.8-02 or §210.8-03, a pro forma

88




balance sheet giving effect to the combination as of the date of the most recent balance
sheet. For a purchase, pro forma statements of income reflecting the combined
operations of the entities for the latest fiscal year and interim period, if any, are required.
§ 210.8-06 Real estate operations acquired or to be acquired.
If, during the period for which income statements are required, the smaller
reporting company has acquired one or more properties that in the aggregate are
significant, or since the date of the latest balance sheet required by § 210.8-02 or §
210.8-03, has acquired or proposes to acquire one or more properties that in the aggregate
are significant, the following shall be furnished with respect to such properties:
(a) Audited income statements (not including earnings per unit) for the two most
recent years, which shall exclude items not comparable to the proposed future operations
of the property such as mortgage interest, leasehold rental, depreciation, corporate
expenses and federal and state income taxes; Provided, however, that such audited
statements need be presented for only the most recent fiscal year if:
(1) The property is not acquired from a related party;
(2) Material factors considered by the smaller reporting company in assessing the
property are described with specificity in the registration statement with regard to the
property, including source of revenue (including, but not limited to, competition in the
rental market, comparative rents, occupancy rates) and expenses (including but not
limited to, utilities, ad valorem tax rates, maintenance expenses, and capital
improvements anticipated); and
(3) The smaller reporting company indicates that, after reasonable inquiry, it is
not aware of any material factors relating to the specific property other than those

89




discussed in response to paragraph (a)(2) of this section that would cause the reported
financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results.
(b) If the property will be operated by the smaller reporting company, a statement
shall be furnished showing the estimated taxable operating results of the smaller reporting
company based on the most recent twelve-month period, including such adjustments as
can be factually supported. If the property will be acquired subject to a net lease, the
estimated taxable operating results shall be based on the rent to be paid for the first year
of the lease. In either case, the estimated amount of cash to be made available by
operations shall be shown. Disclosure must be provided of the principal assumptions that
have been made in preparing the statements of estimated taxable operating results and
cash to be made available by operations.
(c) If appropriate under the circumstances, a table should be provided that shows,
for a limited number of years, the estimated cash distribution per unit, indicating the
portion reportable as taxable income and the portion representing a return of capital with
an explanation of annual variations, if any. If taxable net income per unit will be greater
than the cash available for distribution per unit, that fact and the approximate year of
occurrence shall be stated, if significant.
§ 210.8-07 Limited partnerships.
(a) Smaller reporting companies that are limited partnerships must provide the
balance sheets of the general partners as described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this
section.
(b) Where a general partner is a corporation, the audited balance sheet of the
corporation as of the end of its most recently completed fiscal year must be filed.

90




Receivables, other than trade receivables, from affiliates of the general partner should be
deducted from shareholders' equity of the general partner. Where an affiliate has
committed itself to increase or maintain the general partner's capital, the audited balance
sheet of such affiliate must also be presented.
(c) Where a general partner is a partnership, there shall be filed an audited balance
sheet of such partnership as of the end of its most recently completed fiscal year.
(d) Where the general partner is a natural person, there shall be filed, as
supplemental information, a balance sheet of such natural person as of a recent date.
Such balance sheet need not be audited. The assets and liabilities should be carried at
estimated fair market value, with provisions for estimated income taxes on unrealized
gains. The net worth of such general partner(s), based on such balance sheet(s), singly or
in the aggregate, shall be disclosed in the registration statement.
§ 210.8-08 Age of financial statements.
At the date of filing, financial statements included in filings other than filings on
Form 10–K must be not less current than the financial statements that would be required
in Forms 10–K and 10–Q if such reports were required to be filed. If required financial
statements are as of a date 135 days or more before the date a registration statement
becomes effective or proxy material is expected to be mailed, the financial statements
shall be updated to include financial statements for an interim period ending within 135
days of the effective or expected mailing date. Interim financial statements must be
prepared and presented in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(a) When the anticipated effective or mailing date falls within 45 days after the
end of the fiscal year, the filing may include financial statements only as current as of the

91




end of the third fiscal quarter; Provided, however, that if the audited financial statements
for the recently completed fiscal year are available or become available before
effectiveness or mailing, they must be included in the filing; and
(b) If the effective date or anticipated mailing date falls after 45 days but within
90 days of the end of the smaller reporting company's fiscal year, the smaller reporting
company is not required to provide the audited financial statements for such year end
provided that the following conditions are met:
(1) If the smaller reporting company is a reporting company, all reports due must
have been filed;
(2) For the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are not
yet available, the smaller reporting company reasonably and in good faith expects to
report income from continuing operations before taxes; and
(3) For at least one of the two fiscal years immediately preceding the most recent
fiscal year the smaller reporting company reported income from continuing operations
before taxes.

Exhibits

(1) Definition of smaller reporting company. As used in this part, the term
smaller reporting company means an issuer that is not an investment company, an assetbacked issuer (as defined in § 229.1101), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that
is not a smaller reporting company and that:
(i) Had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its
most recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate
worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by
non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of
the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common
equity; or
(ii) In the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or
Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $75 million
as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement, computed
by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-affiliates
before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the
number of such shares included in the registration statement by the estimated public
offering price of the shares; or
(iii) In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under paragraph (i)
or (ii) of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the
most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.

95




(2) Determination: Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting company is
determined on an annual basis.
(i) For issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, the determination is based on whether the issuer came within the
definition of smaller reporting company, using the amounts specified in paragraph
(f)(2)(iii) of this Item, as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of the
issuer’s previous fiscal year. An issuer in this category must reflect this determination in
the information it provides in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter
of the next year, indicating on the cover page of that filing, and in subsequent filings for
that fiscal year, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company, except that, if a
determination based on public float indicates that the issuer is newly eligible to be a
smaller reporting company, the issuer may choose to reflect this determination beginning
with its first quarterly report on Form 10-Q following the determination, rather than
waiting until the first fiscal quarter of the next year.
(ii) For determinations based on an initial Securities Act or Exchange Act
registration statement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this Item, the issuer must reflect the
determination in the information it provides in the registration statement and must
appropriately indicate on the cover page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal
year in which the filing is made, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company. The
issuer must redetermine its status at the end of its second fiscal quarter and then reflect
any change in status as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this Item. In the case of a
determination based on an initial Securities Act registration statement, an issuer that was
not determined to be a smaller reporting company has the option to redetermine its status

96




at the conclusion of the offering covered by the registration statement based on the actual
offering price and number of shares sold.
(iii) Once an issuer fails to qualify for smaller reporting company status, it will
remain unqualified unless it determines that its public float, as calculated in accordance
with paragraph (f)(1) of this Item, was less than $50 million as of the last business day of
its second fiscal quarter or, if that calculation results in zero because the issuer had no
public equity outstanding or no market price for its equity existed, if the issuers had
annual revenues of less than $40 million during its previous fiscal year.

disclosure in paragraphs (m) through (r) instead of paragraphs (a) through (k) of this
Item.
(m) Smaller reporting companies - General
(1) All compensation covered. This Item requires clear, concise and
understandable disclosure of all plan and non-plan compensation awarded to, earned by,
or paid to the named executive officers designated under paragraph (m)(2) of this Item,
and directors covered by paragraph (r) of this Item, by any person for all services
rendered in all capacities to the smaller reporting company and its subsidiaries, unless
otherwise specifically excluded from disclosure in this Item. All such compensation shall
be reported pursuant to this Item, even if also called for by another requirement,
including transactions between the smaller reporting company and a third party where a
purpose of the transaction is to furnish compensation to any such named executive officer
or director. No amount reported as compensation for one fiscal year need be reported in
the same manner as compensation for a subsequent fiscal year; amounts reported as
compensation for one fiscal year may be required to be reported in a different manner
pursuant to this Item.
(2) Persons covered. Disclosure shall be provided pursuant to this Item for each
of the following (the “named executive officers”):
(i) All individuals serving as the smaller reporting company's principal executive
officer or acting in a similar capacity during the last completed fiscal year (“PEO”),
regardless of compensation level;

106




(ii) The smaller reporting company's two most highly compensated executive
officers other than the PEO who were serving as executive officers at the end of the last
completed fiscal year; and
(iii) Up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been
provided pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this Item but for the fact that the individual
was not serving as an executive officer of the smaller reporting company at the end of the
last completed fiscal year.
Instructions to Item 402(m)(2).
1. Determination of most highly compensated executive officers. The
determination as to which executive officers are most highly compensated shall be made
by reference to total compensation for the last completed fiscal year (as required to be
disclosed pursuant to paragraph (n)(2)(x) of this Item) reduced by the amount required to
be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (n)(2)(viii) of this Item, provided, however, that no
disclosure need be provided for any executive officer, other than the PEO, whose total
compensation, as so reduced, does not exceed $100,000.
2. Inclusion of executive officer of a subsidiary. It may be appropriate for a
smaller reporting company to include as named executive officers one or more executive
officers or other employees of subsidiaries in the disclosure required by this Item. See
Rule 3b–7 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.3b–7).
3. Exclusion of executive officer due to overseas compensation. It may be
appropriate in limited circumstances for a smaller reporting company not to include in the
disclosure required by this Item an individual, other than its PEO, who is one of the
smaller reporting company's most highly compensated executive officers due to the

107




payment of amounts of cash compensation relating to overseas assignments attributed
predominantly to such assignments.
(3) Information for full fiscal year. If the PEO served in that capacity during any
part of a fiscal year with respect to which information is required, information should be
provided as to all of his or her compensation for the full fiscal year. If a named executive
officer (other than the PEO) served as an executive officer of the smaller reporting
company (whether or not in the same position) during any part of the fiscal year with
respect to which information is required, information shall be provided as to all
compensation of that individual for the full fiscal year.
(4) Omission of table or column. A table or column may be omitted if there has
been no compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to any of the named executive
officers or directors required to be reported in that table or column in any fiscal year
covered by that table.
(5) Definitions. For purposes of this Item:
(i) The term stock means instruments such as common stock, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, phantom stock, phantom stock units, common stock equivalent
units or any similar instruments that do not have option-like features, and the term option
means instruments such as stock options, stock appreciation rights and similar
instruments with option-like features. The term stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) refers
to SARs payable in cash or stock, including SARs payable in cash or stock at the election
of the smaller reporting company or a named executive officer. The term equity is used
to refer generally to stock and/or options.

108




(ii) The term plan includes, but is not limited to, the following: Any plan,
contract, authorization or arrangement, whether or not set forth in any formal document,
pursuant to which cash, securities, similar instruments, or any other property may be
received. A plan may be applicable to one person. Smaller reporting companies may
omit information regarding group life, health, hospitalization, or medical reimbursement
plans that do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive officers
or directors of the smaller reporting company and that are available generally to all
salaried employees.
(iii) The term incentive plan means any plan providing compensation intended to
serve as incentive for performance to occur over a specified period, whether such
performance is measured by reference to financial performance of the smaller reporting
company or an affiliate, the smaller reporting company's stock price, or any other
performance measure. An equity incentive plan is an incentive plan or portion of an
incentive plan under which awards are granted that fall within the scope of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, as modified or supplemented (“FAS 123R”). A
non-equity incentive plan is an incentive plan or portion of an incentive plan that is not an
equity incentive plan. The term incentive plan award means an award provided under an
incentive plan.
(iv) The terms date of grant or grant date refer to the grant date determined for
financial statement reporting purposes pursuant to FAS 123R.

109




(v) Closing market price is defined as the price at which the smaller reporting
company's security was last sold in the principal United States market for such security as
of the date for which the closing market price is determined.

Provide the information specified in paragraph (n)(2) of this Item, concerning the
compensation of the named executive officers for each of the smaller reporting
company's last two completed fiscal years, in a Summary Compensation Table in the

through the latest practicable date, a footnote shall be included disclosing that the amount
of salary or bonus is not calculable through the latest practicable date and providing the
date that the amount of salary or bonus is expected to be determined, and such amount
must then be disclosed in a filing under Item 5.02(f) of Form 8–K (17 CFR 249.308).

compensation instead have been received by the named executive officer. However, the
receipt of any such form of non-cash compensation instead of salary or bonus must be
disclosed in a footnote added to the salary or bonus column and, where applicable,

recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in
accordance with FAS 123R (column (f));
Instruction to Item 402(n)(2)(v) and (vi). For awards reported in columns (e) and
(f), disregard the estimate of forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions.
Include a footnote describing all forfeitures during the year, and disclosing all
assumptions made in the valuation. Disclose assumptions made in the valuation by
reference to a discussion of those assumptions in the registrant's financial statements,
footnotes to the financial statements, or discussion in the Management's Discussion and
Analysis. The sections so referenced are deemed part of the disclosure provided pursuant
to this Item.
(vii) The dollar value of all earnings for services performed during the fiscal year
pursuant to awards under non-equity incentive plans as defined in paragraph (m)(5)(iii) of
this Item, and all earnings on any outstanding awards (column (g));
Instructions to Item 402(n)(2)(vii).
1. If the relevant performance measure is satisfied during the fiscal year
(including for a single year in a plan with a multi-year performance measure), the
earnings are reportable for that fiscal year, even if not payable until a later date, and are
not reportable again in the fiscal year when amounts are paid to the named executive
officer.
2. All earnings on non-equity incentive plan compensation must be identified and
quantified in a footnote to column (g), whether the earnings were paid during the fiscal

112




year, payable during the period but deferred at the election of the named executive
officer, or payable by their terms at a later date.
(viii) Above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is deferred on
a basis that is not tax-qualified, including such earnings on nonqualified defined
contribution plans (column (h));
Instruction to Item 402(n)(2)(viii). Interest on deferred compensation is abovemarket only if the rate of interest exceeds 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate,
with compounding (as prescribed under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code,
(26 U.S.C. 1274(d))) at the rate that corresponds most closely to the rate under the
smaller reporting company's plan at the time the interest rate or formula is set. In the
event of a discretionary reset of the interest rate, the requisite calculation must be made
on the basis of the interest rate at the time of such reset, rather than when originally
established. Only the above-market portion of the interest must be included. If the
applicable interest rates vary depending upon conditions such as a minimum period of
continued service, the reported amount should be calculated assuming satisfaction of all
conditions to receiving interest at the highest rate. Dividends (and dividend equivalents)
on deferred compensation denominated in the smaller reporting company's stock
(“deferred stock”) are preferential only if earned at a rate higher than dividends on the
smaller reporting company's common stock. Only the preferential portion of the
dividends or equivalents must be included. Footnote or narrative disclosure may be
provided explaining the smaller reporting company's criteria for determining any portion
considered to be above-market.

113




(ix) All other compensation for the covered fiscal year that the smaller reporting
company could not properly report in any other column of the Summary Compensation
Table (column (i)). Each compensation item that is not properly reportable in columns
(c) through (h), regardless of the amount of the compensation item, must be included in
column (i). Such compensation must include, but is not limited to:
(A) Perquisites and other personal benefits, or property, unless the aggregate
amount of such compensation is less than $10,000;
(B) All “gross-ups” or other amounts reimbursed during the fiscal year for the
payment of taxes;
(C) For any security of the smaller reporting company or its subsidiaries
purchased from the smaller reporting company or its subsidiaries (through deferral of
salary or bonus, or otherwise) at a discount from the market price of such security at the
date of purchase, unless that discount is available generally, either to all security holders
or to all salaried employees of the smaller reporting company, the compensation cost, if
any, computed in accordance with FAS 123R;
(D) The amount paid or accrued to any named executive officer pursuant to a
plan or arrangement in connection with:
(1) Any termination, including without limitation through retirement, resignation,
severance or constructive termination (including a change in responsibilities) of such
executive officer's employment with the smaller reporting company and its subsidiaries;
or
(2) A change in control of the smaller reporting company;

114




(E) Smaller reporting company contributions or other allocations to vested and
unvested defined contribution plans;
(F) The dollar value of any insurance premiums paid by, or on behalf of, the
smaller reporting company during the covered fiscal year with respect to life insurance
for the benefit of a named executive officer; and
(G) The dollar value of any dividends or other earnings paid on stock or option
awards, when those amounts were not factored into the grant date fair value for the stock
or option award; and
Instructions to Item 402(n)(2)(ix).
1. Non-equity incentive plan awards and earnings and earnings on stock or
options, except as specified in paragraph (n)(2)(ix)(G) of this Item, are required to be
reported elsewhere as provided in this Item and are not reportable as All Other
Compensation in column (i).
2. Benefits paid pursuant to defined benefit and actuarial plans are not reportable
as All Other Compensation in column (i) unless accelerated pursuant to a change in
control; information concerning these plans is reportable pursuant to paragraph (q)(1) of
this Item.
3. Reimbursements of taxes owed with respect to perquisites or other personal
benefits must be included in the columns as tax reimbursements (paragraph (n)(2)(ix)(B)
of this Item) even if the associated perquisites or other personal benefits are not required
to be included because the aggregate amount of such compensation is less than $10,000.
4. Perquisites and other personal benefits shall be valued on the basis of the
aggregate incremental cost to the smaller reporting company.

115




5. For purposes of paragraph (n)(2)(ix)(D) of this Item, an accrued amount is an
amount for which payment has become due.
(x) The dollar value of total compensation for the covered fiscal year (column
(j)). With respect to each named executive officer, disclose the sum of all amounts
reported in columns (c) through (i).
Instructions to Item 402(n).
1. Information with respect to the fiscal year prior to the last completed fiscal
year will not be required if the smaller reporting company was not a reporting company
pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(a) or 78o(d)) at
any time during that year, except that the smaller reporting company will be required to
provide information for any such year if that information previously was required to be
provided in response to a Commission filing requirement.
2. All compensation values reported in the Summary Compensation Table must
be reported in dollars and rounded to the nearest dollar. Reported compensation values
must be reported numerically, providing a single numerical value for each grid in the
table. Where compensation was paid to or received by a named executive officer in a
different currency, a footnote must be provided to identify that currency and describe the
rate and methodology used to convert the payment amounts to dollars.
3. If a named executive officer is also a director who receives compensation for
his or her services as a director, reflect that compensation in the Summary Compensation
Table and provide a footnote identifying and itemizing such compensation and amounts.
Use the categories in the Director Compensation Table required pursuant to paragraph (r)
of this Item.

116




4. Any amounts deferred, whether pursuant to a plan established under section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401(k)), or otherwise, shall be included
in the appropriate column for the fiscal year in which earned.
(o) Smaller reporting companies - Narrative disclosure to summary compensation

understanding of the information disclosed in the Table required by paragraph (n) of this
Item. Examples of such factors may include, in given cases, among other things:

or arrangement, whether written or unwritten;
(2) If at any time during the last fiscal year, any outstanding option or other
equity-based award was repriced or otherwise materially modified (such as by extension

elimination of applicable performance criteria, or the change of the bases upon which
returns are determined), a description of each such repricing or other material
modification;
(3) The waiver or modification of any specified performance target, goal or
condition to payout with respect to any amount included in non-stock incentive plan
compensation or payouts reported in column (g) to the Summary Compensation Table

to one or more specified named executive officers or to all compensation subject to the
target, goal or condition;
(4) The material terms of each grant, including but not limited to the date of
exercisability, any conditions to exercisability, any tandem feature, any reload feature,

117




any tax-reimbursement feature, and any provision that could cause the exercise price to
be lowered;

executive officer during the last completed fiscal year, including a general description of
the formula or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts payable and vesting
schedule;
(6) The method of calculating earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation
plans including nonqualified defined contribution plans; and
(7) An identification to the extent material of any item included under All Other
Compensation (column (i)) in the Summary Compensation Table. Identification of an
item shall not be considered material if it does not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10%
of all items included in the specified category in question set forth in paragraph (n)(2)(ix)
of this Item. All items of compensation are required to be included in the Summary
Compensation Table without regard to whether such items are required to be identified.
Instruction to Item 402(o). The disclosure required by paragraph (o)(2) of this
Item would not apply to any repricing that occurs through a pre-existing formula or
mechanism in the plan or award that results in the periodic adjustment of the option or
SAR exercise or base price, an antidilution provision in a plan or award, or a
recapitalization or similar transaction equally affecting all holders of the class of
securities underlying the options or SARs.

options, including awards that have been transferred other than for value, that are
exercisable and that are not reported in column (d) (column (b));

119




(iii) On an award-by-award basis, the number of securities underlying

Instructions to Item 402(p)(2).
1. Identify by footnote any award that has been transferred other than for value,
disclosing the nature of the transfer.

120




2. The vesting dates of options, shares of stock and equity incentive plan awards
held at fiscal-year end must be disclosed by footnote to the applicable column where the
outstanding award is reported.
3. Compute the market value of stock reported in column (h) and equity incentive
plan awards of stock reported in column (j) by multiplying the closing market price of the
smaller reporting company's stock at the end of the last completed fiscal year by the
number of shares or units of stock or the amount of equity incentive plan awards,
respectively. The number of shares or units reported in column (d) or (i), and the payout
value reported in column (j), shall be based on achieving threshold performance goals,
except that if the previous fiscal year's performance has exceeded the threshold, the
disclosure shall be based on the next higher performance measure (target or maximum)

expiration date.
5. Options or stock awarded under an equity incentive plan are reported in

named executive officer, or a change in control of the smaller reporting company or a
change in the named executive officer's responsibilities following a change in control,
with respect to each named executive officer.
(r) Smaller reporting companies - Compensation of directors. (1) Provide the

column (g) and must be identified and quantified in a footnote if it is deemed material in
accordance with paragraph (o)(7) of this Item. Such compensation must include, but is

companies agree to make donations to one or more charitable institutions in a director's
name, payable by the smaller reporting company currently or upon a designated event,
such as the retirement or death of the director, are charitable awards programs or director

Amend § 230.405 by removing the definition of “small business issuer” and

adding the definition of “smaller reporting company” in alphabetical order to read as
follows:

143




§ 230.405

Definitions of terms.
*****

Smaller reporting company: As used in this part, the term smaller reporting
company means an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer (as
defined in § 229.1101 of this chapter), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is
not a smaller reporting company and that:
(1) Had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its
most recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate
worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by
non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of
the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common
equity; or
(2) In the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or
Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $75 million
as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement, computed
by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-affiliates
before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the
number of such shares included in the registration statement by the estimated public
offering price of the shares; or
(3) In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under paragraph (1) or
(2) of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the
most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.

144




(4) Determination: Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting company is
determined on an annual basis.
(i) For issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, the determination is based on whether the issuer came within the
definition of smaller reporting company using the amounts specified in paragraph
(f)(2)(iii) of Item 10 of Regulation S-K (§ 229.10(f)(1)(i) of this chapter), as of the last
business day of the second fiscal quarter of the issuer’s previous fiscal year. An issuer in
this category must reflect this determination in the information it provides in its quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of the next year, indicating on the cover
page of that filing, and in subsequent filings for that fiscal year, whether or not it is a
smaller reporting company, except that, if a determination based on public float indicates
that the issuer is newly eligible to be a smaller reporting company, the issuer may choose
to reflect this determination beginning with its first quarterly report on Form 10-Q
following the determination, rather than waiting until the first fiscal quarter of the next
year.
(ii) For determinations based on an initial Securities Act or Exchange Act
registration statement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of Item 10 of Regulation S-K (§
229.10(f)(1)(ii) of this chapter), the issuer must reflect the determination in the
information it provides in the registration statement and must appropriately indicate on
the cover page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal year in which the filing
is made, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company. The issuer must redetermine
its status at the end of its second fiscal quarter and then reflect any change in status as
provided in paragraph (4)(i) of this definition. In the case of a determination based on an

145




initial Securities Act registration statement, an issuer that was not determined to be a
smaller reporting company has the option to redetermine its status at the conclusion of the
offering covered by the registration statement based on the actual offering price and
number of shares sold.
(iii) Once an issuer fails to qualify for smaller reporting company status, it will
remain unqualified unless it determines that its public float, as calculated in accordance
with paragraph (f)(1) of this definition, was less than $50 million as of the last business
day of its second fiscal quarter or, if that calculation results in zero because the issuer had
no public equity outstanding or no market price for its equity existed, if the issuer had
annual revenues of less than $40 million during its previous fiscal year.

Smaller reporting company: As used in this part, the term smaller reporting
company means an issuer that is not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer (as
defined in § 229.1101 of this chapter), or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent that is
not a smaller reporting company and that:
(1) Had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its
most recently completed second fiscal quarter, computed by multiplying the aggregate
worldwide number of shares of its voting and non-voting common equity held by
non-affiliates by the price at which the common equity was last sold, or the average of
the bid and asked prices of common equity, in the principal market for the common
equity; or
(2) In the case of an initial registration statement under the Securities Act or
Exchange Act for shares of its common equity, had a public float of less than $75 million
as of a date within 30 days of the date of the filing of the registration statement, computed
by multiplying the aggregate worldwide number of such shares held by non-affiliates
before the registration plus, in the case of a Securities Act registration statement, the
number of such shares included in the registration statement by the estimated public
offering price of the shares; or
(3) In the case of an issuer whose public float as calculated under paragraph (1) or
(2) of this definition was zero, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the
most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available.
(4) Determination: Whether or not an issuer is a smaller reporting company is
determined on an annual basis.

172




(i) For issuers that are required to file reports under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, the determination is based on whether the issuer came within the
definition of smaller reporting company using the amounts specified in paragraph
(f)(2)(iii) of Item 10 of Regulation S-K (§ 229.10(f)(1)(i) of this chapter), as of the last
business day of the second fiscal quarter of the issuer’s previous fiscal year. An issuer in
this category must reflect this determination in the information it provides in its quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of the next year, indicating on the cover
page of that filing, and in subsequent filings for that fiscal year, whether or not it is a
smaller reporting company, except that, if a determination based on public float indicates
that the issuer is newly eligible to be a smaller reporting company, the issuer may choose
to reflect this determination beginning with its first quarterly report on Form 10-Q
following the determination, rather than waiting until the first fiscal quarter of the next
year.
(ii) For determinations based on an initial Securities Act or Exchange Act
registration statement under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of Item 10 of Regulation S-K (§
229.10(f)(1)(ii) of this chapter), the issuer must reflect the determination in the
information it provides in the registration statement and must appropriately indicate on
the cover page of the filing, and subsequent filings for the fiscal year in which the filing
is made, whether or not it is a smaller reporting company. The issuer must redetermine
its status at the end of its second fiscal quarter and then reflect any change in status as
provided in paragraph (4)(i) of this definition. In the case of a determination based on an
initial Securities Act registration statement, an issuer that was not determined to be a
smaller reporting company has the option to redetermine its status at the conclusion of the

173




offering covered by the registration statement based on the actual offering price and
number of shares sold.
(iii) Once an issuer fails to qualify for smaller reporting company status, it will
remain unqualified unless it determines that its public float, as calculated in accordance
with paragraph (f)(1) of this definition, was less than $50 million as of the last business
day of its second fiscal quarter or, if that calculation results in zero because the issuer had
no public equity outstanding or no market price for its equity existed, if the issuers had
annual revenues of less than $40 million during its previous fiscal year.

reference of documents that incorporate by reference other information. Material
incorporated by reference shall be clearly identified in the reference by page, paragraph,
and caption or otherwise. Where only certain pages of a document are incorporated by
reference and filed as an exhibit, the document from which the material is taken shall be

174




clearly identified in the reference. An express statement that the specified matter is
incorporated by reference shall be made at the particular place in the statement or report
where the information is required. Matter shall not be incorporated by reference in any
case where such incorporation would render the statement or report incomplete, unclear
or confusing.

securities does not meet the eligibility criteria of paragraph (b) of this section on the first
day of an issuer's fiscal year, then the issuer shall resume periodic reporting pursuant to
section 15(d) of the Act by filing an annual report on Form 10–K for its preceding fiscal
year, not later than 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.

Amend § 240.13a-10 by revising paragraphs (c), (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iii), the

introductory text of paragraph (e), paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(4), the Note to paragraphs

§ 240.13a-10 Transition reports.
*****
(c) If the transition period covers a period of less than six months, in lieu of the
report required by paragraph (b) of this section, a report may be filed for the transition
period on Form 10–Q (§ 249.308a of this chapter) not more than the number of days
specified in paragraph (j) of this section after either the close of the transition period or

176




the date of the determination to change the fiscal closing date, whichever is later. The
report on Form 10–Q shall cover the period from the close of the last fiscal year end and
shall indicate clearly the period covered. The financial statements filed therewith need
not be audited but, if they are not audited, the issuer shall file with the first annual report
for the newly adopted fiscal year separate audited statements of income and cash flows
covering the transition period. The notes to financial statements for the transition period
included in such first annual report may be integrated with the notes to financial
statements for the full fiscal period. A separate audited balance sheet as of the end of the
transition period shall be filed in the annual report only if the audited balance sheet as of
the end of the fiscal year prior to the transition period is not filed. Schedules need not be
filed in transition reports on Form 10–Q.
(d) * * *
(2) * * *
(ii) The first report required to be filed by the issuer for the newly adopted fiscal
year after the date of the determination to change the fiscal year end is a quarterly report
on Form 10-Q; and
(iii) Information on the transition period is included in the issuer's quarterly report
on Form 10–Q for the first quarterly period (except the fourth quarter) of the newly
adopted fiscal year that ends after the date of the determination to change the fiscal year.
The information covering the transition period required by Part II and Item 2 of Part I
may be combined with the information regarding the quarter. However, the financial
statements required by Part I, which may be unaudited, shall be furnished separately for
the transition period.

177




(e) Every issuer required to file quarterly reports on Form 10–Q pursuant to §
240.13a-13 of this chapter that changes its fiscal year end shall:
(1) File a quarterly report on Form 10–Q within the time period specified in
General Instruction A.1. to that form for any quarterly period (except the fourth quarter)
of the old fiscal year that ends before the date on which the issuer determined to change
its fiscal year end, except that the issuer need not file such quarterly report if the date on
which the quarterly period ends also is the date on which the transition period ends;
(2) File a quarterly report on Form 10–Q within the time specified in General
Instruction A.1. to that form for each quarterly period of the old fiscal year within the
transition period. In lieu of a quarterly report for any quarter of the old fiscal year within
the transition period, the issuer may file a quarterly report on Form 10–Q for any period
of three months within the transition period that coincides with a quarter of the newly
adopted fiscal year if the quarterly report is filed within the number of days specified in
paragraph (j) of this section after the end of such three month period, provided the issuer
thereafter continues filing quarterly reports on the basis of the quarters of the newly
adopted fiscal year;
*****
(4) Unless such information is or will be included in the transition report, or the
first annual report on Form 10–K for the newly adopted fiscal year, include in the initial
quarterly report on Form 10–Q for the newly adopted fiscal year information on any
period beginning on the first day subsequent to the period covered by the issuer's final
quarterly report on Form 10–Q or annual report on Form 10–K for the old fiscal year.
The information covering such period required by Part II and Item 2 of Part I may be

178




combined with the information regarding the quarter. However, the financial statements
required by Part I, which may be unaudited, shall be furnished separately for such period.
Note to paragraphs (c) and (e): If it is not practicable or cannot be cost-justified to
furnish in a transition report on Form 10–Q or a quarterly report for the newly adopted
fiscal year financial statements for corresponding periods of the prior year where
required, financial statements may be furnished for the quarters of the preceding fiscal
year that most nearly are comparable if the issuer furnishes an adequate discussion of
seasonal and other factors that could affect the comparability of information or trends
reflected, an assessment of the comparability of the data, and a representation as to the
reason recasting has not been undertaken.

reports pursuant to section 13 of the Act, and has filed or intends to file such reports on
Form 10–K (§ 249.310 of this chapter), shall file a quarterly report on Form 10–Q (§

statements were included in the registration statement, or, if the registration statement
included financial statements for an interim period subsequent to the most recent fiscal
year end meeting the requirements of Article 10 of Regulation S-X and Rule 8-03 of
Regulation S-X for smaller reporting companies, for the first fiscal quarter subsequent to
the quarter reported upon in the registration statement. The first quarterly report of the
issuer shall be filed either within 45 days after the effective date of the registration
statement or on or before the date on which such report would have been required to be
filed if the issuer has been required to file reports on Form 10–Q as of its last fiscal
quarter, whichever is later.

applicable exhibit filing requirements of such report and such certifications must be filed
as an exhibit to such report. Each principal executive and principal financial officer of

may omit the portion of the introductory language in paragraph 4 as well as language in
paragraph 4(b) of the certification that refers to the certifying officers' responsibility for
designing, establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting for the

and audited balance sheets as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited
statements of income and cash flows for each of the three most recent fiscal years
prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X (part 210 of this chapter), except that the
provisions of Article 3 (other than §§ 210.3-03(e), 210.3-04 and 210.3-20) and Article 11
shall not apply. Any financial statement schedules or exhibits or separate financial
statements which may otherwise be required in filings with the Commission may be
omitted. If the financial statements of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated in
the annual report filed or to be filed with the Commission are not required to be audited,
the financial statements required by this paragraph may be unaudited. A smaller

182




reporting company may provide the information in Article 8 of Regulation S-X (§ 210.8
of this chapter) in lieu of the financial information required by this paragraph 9(b)(1).
Note 1 to Paragraph (b)(1): If the financial statements for a period prior to the
most recently completed fiscal year have been examined by a predecessor accountant, the
separate report of the predecessor accountant may be omitted in the report to security
holders, provided the registrant has obtained from the predecessor accountant a reissued
report covering the prior period presented and the successor accountant clearly indicates
in the scope paragraph of his or her report (a) that the financial statements of the prior
period were examined by other accountants, (b) the date of their report, (c) the type of
opinion expressed by the predecessor accountant and (d) the substantive reasons
therefore, if it was other than unqualified. It should be noted, however, that the separate
report of any predecessor accountant is required in filings with the Commission. If, for
instance, the financial statements in the annual report to security holders are incorporated
by reference in a Form 10–K, the separate report of a predecessor accountant shall be
filed in Part II or in Part IV as a financial statement schedule.

(ii) The report shall contain management's discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K (§ 229.303 of

in bold face or otherwise reasonably prominent type to provide without charge to each

183




person solicited upon the written request of any such person, a copy of the registrant's
annual report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the financial
statement schedules, required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 13a–1 (§
240.13a-1 of this chapter) under the Act for the registrant's most recent fiscal year, and
shall indicate the name and address (including title or department) of the person to whom
such a written request is to be directed. In the discretion of management, a registrant
need not undertake to furnish without charge copies of all exhibits to its Form 10–K,
provided that the copy of the annual report on Form 10–K furnished without charge to
requesting security holders is accompanied by a list briefly describing all the exhibits not
contained therein and indicating that the registrant will furnish any exhibit upon the
payment of a specified reasonable fee, which fee shall be limited to the registrant's
reasonable expenses in furnishing such exhibit. If the registrant's annual report to
security holders complies with all of the disclosure requirements of Form 10–K and is
filed with the Commission in satisfaction of its Form 10–K filing requirements, such

period on Form 10–Q (§ 249.308 of this chapter) not more than the number of days
specified in paragraph (j) of this section after either the close of the transition period or
the date of the determination to change the fiscal closing date, whichever is later. The
report on Form 10–Q shall cover the period from the close of the last fiscal year end and
shall indicate clearly the period covered. The financial statements filed therewith need
not be audited but, if they are not audited, the issuer shall file with the first annual report
for the newly adopted fiscal year separate audited statements of income and cash flows
covering the transition period. The notes to financial statements for the transition period
included in such first annual report may be integrated with the notes to financial
statements for the full fiscal period. A separate audited balance sheet as of the end of the

on Form 10–Q for the first quarterly period (except the fourth quarter) of the newly
adopted fiscal year that ends after the date of the determination to change the fiscal year.
The information covering the transition period required by Part II and Item 2 of Part I
may be combined with the information regarding the quarter. However, the financial
statements required by Part I, which may be unaudited, shall be furnished separately for
the transition period.
*****
(e) Every issuer required to file quarterly reports on Form 10–Q pursuant to §
240.15d-13 that changes its fiscal year end shall:
(1) File a quarterly report on Form 10–Q within the time period specified in
General Instruction A.1. to that form for any quarterly period (except the fourth quarter)
of the old fiscal year that ends before the date on which the issuer determined to change
its fiscal year end, except that the issuer need not file such quarterly report if the date on
which the quarterly period ends also is the date on which the transition period ends;
(2) File a quarterly report on Form 10–Q within the time specified in General
Instruction A.1 to that form for each quarterly period of the old fiscal year within the
transition period. In lieu of a quarterly report for any quarter of the old fiscal year within
the transition period, the issuer may file a quarterly report on Form 10–Q for any period
of three months within the transition period that coincides with a quarter of the newly

191




adopted fiscal year if the quarterly report is filed within the number of days specified in
paragraph (j) of this section after the end of such three month period, provided the issuer
thereafter continues filing quarterly reports on the basis of the quarters of the newly
adopted fiscal year;

first annual report on Form 10–K for the newly adopted fiscal year, include in the initial
quarterly report on Form 10–Q for the newly adopted fiscal year information on any
period beginning on the first day after the period covered by the issuer's final quarterly
report on Form 10–Q or annual report on Form 10–K for the old fiscal year. The
information covering such period required by Part II and Item 2 of Part I may be
combined with the information regarding the quarter. However, the financial statements
required by Part I, which may be unaudited, shall be furnished separately for such period.
Note to Paragraphs (c) and (e): If it is not practicable or cannot be cost-justified
to furnish in a transition report on Form 10–Q or a quarterly report for the newly adopted
fiscal year financial statements for corresponding periods of the prior year where
required, financial statements may be furnished for the quarters of the preceding fiscal
year that most nearly are comparable if the issuer furnishes an adequate discussion of
seasonal and other factors that could affect the comparability of information or trends
reflected, an assessment of the comparability of the data, and a representation as to the
reason recasting has not been undertaken.
(f) Every successor issuer that has a different fiscal year from that of its
predecessor(s) shall file a transition report pursuant to this section, containing the

192




required information about each predecessor, for the transition period, if any, between the
close of the fiscal year covered by the last annual report of each predecessor and the date
of succession. The report shall be filed for the transition period on the form appropriate
for annual reports of the issuer not more than the number of days specified in paragraph
(j) of this section after the date of the succession, with financial statements in conformity
with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the transition period
covers a period of less than six months, in lieu of a transition report on the form
appropriate for the issuer's annual reports, the report may be filed for the transition period
on Form 10–Q not more than the number of days specified in paragraph (j) of this section
after the date of the succession, with financial statements in conformity with the
requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
