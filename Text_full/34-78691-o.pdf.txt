ORDER OF SUSPENSION
OF TRADING

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of MarilynJean Interactive Inc. (CIK
0001504464) because of concerns about recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the
company’s common stock. MarilynJean Interactive Inc. is a Nevada corporation with its
principal place of business located in Henderson, Nevada. Its stock is quoted on OTC Link
(previously “Pink Sheets”), operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., under the ticker: MJMI.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on August 26, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on September 9, 2016.
By the Commission.

Secretary
