ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On December 30, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings.
On January 4, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that service of the OIP was accomplished on December 31, 2015, on Respondents
Buncombe, Inc., Cotton Bay Holdings, Inc., and Middlesex Inc., in accordance with Rule of
Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii).1 As such, those Respondents’ answers are
due by January 13, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b).
I POSTPONE the hearing currently scheduled for January 22, 2016, and schedule a
telephonic prehearing conference for 11:00 a.m. EST on that date. Respondents are on notice
that if they fail to file timely answers, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend
the proceeding, I will deem them in default, determine that the allegations in the OIP are true,
and revoke the registrations of their securities. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f),
.221(f).
