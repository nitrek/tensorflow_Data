FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed plan
(the “Plan”) for the distribution of monies paid in the above-captioned matter and, as explained
in the Plan, potentially monies obtained, if any, in the pending related district court action,
SEC v. Premiere Power, LLC, No. 15-cv-1248 (S.D.N.Y.).1
On February 20, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections
15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-andDesist Order (“Order”) against Sandra Dyche (“Dyche” or “Respondent”).2 The Order required
Dyche to pay disgorgement of $1,000,000, prejudgment interest of $164,000, and $250,000 in
civil penalties. In accordance with the Order, Dyche paid a total of $1,000,000 in disgorgement,
$164,000 in prejudgment interest and $250,000.00 in civil monetary penalties to the
Commission.
The Order created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended, for the funds paid by Dyche (the “Fair Fund”). The Fair Fund is subject to
the continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Fair Fund has been deposited

The Commission also filed a civil action against Premiere Power, LLC, its CEO, and its Chairman (collectively,
the “Defendants”). Currently pending in district court, that action, SEC v. Premiere Power, LLC, No. 15-cv-1248
(S.D.N.Y.), alleges that the Defendants participated in a fraudulent scheme, along with Dyche, to misappropriate
investor funds and defrauded the three investors referred to in the Order. The Commission staff intends to request
that the court overseeing SEC v. Premiere Power direct any funds collected as a result of monetary sanctions being
sought in the Commission’s litigation to investors either in accordance with the Plan or to the Commission for
subsequent distribution pursuant to the Plan.

THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Commission is proposing a plan to compensate investors injured by the conduct that
served as the basis for its findings of securities law violations in the Commission’s Order. Based
on the records obtained in the Commission’s investigation and as explained in the Plan, there
were three investors who were fraudulently induced to purchase shares in Premiere Power, LLC
and these investors would be Eligible Investors3 pursuant to the Plan. As set forth in the Plan,
the proposed methodology allocates the Net Fair Fund by totaling the principal invested for each
Eligible Investor, subtracting from this total amount all actual payments an Eligible Investor
received, if any, to arrive at a Net Loss Amount, calculating each Eligible Investor’s Pro Rata
Share of the total net principal invested, and multiplying the Pro Rata Share by the Net Fair
Fund to calculate an Estimated Net Distribution Amount for each Eligible Investor.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
