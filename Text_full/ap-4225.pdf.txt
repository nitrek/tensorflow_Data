ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with
an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (Exchange Act). The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of
securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has
repeatedly failed to file required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to
revoke the registration of Respondents’ securities.
The OIP provides that each Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the
OIP on it. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). Each Respondent was served with the OIP by
September 21, 2016, by USPS Express Mail delivery or attempted delivery at “the most recent
address shown on [its] most recent filing with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii).
To date, each Respondent has failed to file an Answer within the time provided.
Accordingly, each Respondent IS ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE, by October 17, 2016,
why it should not be deemed to be in default and the registration of its securities revoked. See
OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
