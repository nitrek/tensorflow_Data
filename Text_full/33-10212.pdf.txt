OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND
A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER AND
NOTICE OF HEARING

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in
the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and
Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against
William J. Sears (“Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission’s
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the entry of this
Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order and Notice of
Hearing (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
From approximately April 2011 to May 2014 (the “relevant period”), Fusion Pharm, Inc.
(“FSPM”), through its chief executive officer (“CEO”), president and sole director Scott M.
Dittman, and its undisclosed de facto officer and control person William J. Sears, engaged in an
approximately $12.2 million fraudulent scheme in violation of the registration and antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws. The scheme essentially involved four steps. First,
utilizing backdated convertible notes and preferred FSPM stock, FSPM issued common stock to
Microcap, Bayside and Meadpoint, all entities controlled by Sears. Second, Sears, through these
entities, sold the FSPM stock into the market. Third, Sears transferred over $1 million of the
proceeds from the illegal stock sales back to FSPM, where the money was fraudulently recognized
and reported as revenue. Fourth, FSPM issued press releases and financial reports claiming the
false revenues, and failed to disclose Sears’ identity, role, and background in FSPM’s quarterly and
annual reports posted on the OTC Markets Group, Inc.’s website.

Facts
Background
7.
In late 2010, Dittman and Sears took over an existing public company, changing its
name to FSPM in March 2011. Dittman was listed as the CEO of the company, but Sears acted as
an undisclosed executive officer. Among other things, Sears worked at FSPM from its inception,
appeared on non-public company documents as an officer, drew a paycheck, and handled many
day-to-day responsibilities usually reserved for a company officer. Although FSPM was
ostensibly in the business of selling PharmPods, it had almost no revenue to fund its operations.
Instead, from 2011 through 2013, FSPM was funded almost entirely through illegal sales of FSPM
stock.
8.
Initially, FSPM was funded through the sale of stock that Sears received in the
name of Microcap, both from FSPM’s predecessor entity and as part of the transition to FSPM. In
order to make Sears’ sales of FSPM stock appear legitimate, and as part of the fraudulent scheme,
Sears and Dittman made it falsely appear that Sears, through Bayside and Meadpoint, had loaned
money to FSPM. Once Sears and Dittman had exhausted these funds, however, Sears then
converted the fake “debt” owed to Bayside and Meadpoint to unrestricted FSPM shares, which
Bayside and Meadpoint then illegally sold into the market.
9.
As part of the fraudulent scheme, Sears and Dittman funneled approximately $1.3
million from the illegal FSPM stock sales back into FSPM. In turn, FSPM falsely claimed the
3

stock sale proceeds as revenue from sales of PharmPods, thereby increasing FSPM’s stock price
and volume and making the fraud even more profitable. As part of the scheme, Sears and Dittman
hid Sears’ role in FSPM so as to claim falsely that Sears’ entities were not affiliates of FSPM
(which they were), thus facilitating Sears’ illegal sales of unrestricted FSPM stock. They also
failed to disclose FSPM’s purported transactions with Sears’ entities as related party transactions,
which they were based on Sears’ role in FSPM.
Dittman and Sears Funnel Shares Into Microcap, Bayside and Meadpoint
10.
In 2009, Microcap received common shares from FSPM’s predecessor company for
stock promotion work. In 2010, Microcap received preferred shares as part of the transfer of the
predecessor company to Sears and Dittman. In 2011, Microcap purchased FSPM common shares
from an individual FSPM shareholder.
11.
In June 2012, Sears and Dittman prepared fraudulent non-convertible promissory
notes and credit lines between FSPM and Bayside and between FSPM and Meadpoint. The
Bayside non-convertible note and credit line agreement, with a credit limit of $275,000, was
backdated to May 2, 2011. The Meadpoint non-convertible promissory note and credit line
agreement, with a credit limit of $200,000 was backdated to June 15, 2011.
12.
In November/December 2012, the Bayside and Meadpoint notes were re-drafted
as fraudulent convertible notes. The notes were changed from non-convertible to convertible in
order to obtain more unrestricted FSPM stock to sell illegally into the market and to investors,
and in turn to fund FSPM. Without changing the notes to convertible notes, FSPM would not
have been able to issue purportedly unrestricted shares to Sears’ entities. The Bayside note,
backdated to May 2, 2011, was a 10% Convertible Promissory Note and Line of Credit
Agreement in the amount of $275,000, with a conversion rate of $0.01/share. The Meadpoint
convertible note, this time backdated to December 8, 2011, was a 10% Convertible Promissory
Note in the amount of $88,000, with a conversion rate of $0.01/share.
Microcap, Bayside and Meadpoint Illegally Sell Shares Into The Market
13.
From approximately April 28, 2011 through May 8, 2014, Sears, through his
entities Microcap, Bayside, and Meadpoint, illegally sold over $12.2 million of restricted FSPM
stock.
14.
Between approximately April 2011 and December 2012, Microcap sold
approximately 735,000 shares of unregistered FSPM stock. Microcap’s sale of these
unregistered shares was based on false statements to brokers and to FSPM’s stock transfer agent
that Sears had no role at or control of FSPM, and therefore that Microcap was not an affiliate of
FSPM. Almost all of the funds flowing into FSPM’s bank account in 2011 and 2012, either
directly from Microcap or funneled first through Bayside, Meadpoint, or another Sears entity, are
traced back to Microcap’s stock sales.
4

15.
Between approximately February 2013 and April 2013, pursuant to the Bayside
convertible note, Bayside converted debt into 140,000 FSPM common shares and sold them into
the market. In order to facilitate the sales, Sears and Dittman made false statements to brokers
and the transfer agent about Bayside’s purported non-affiliate status. In addition to the
consequences the fraudulent Bayside convertible promissory note had on Bayside’s ability to
receive unrestricted shares, Bayside’s true affiliate status also meant that Bayside needed to
abide by certain volume restrictions, which it failed to do. Bayside sold the remainder of its note
to an investment group for $250,000 and, based on more false statements from Dittman and
Sears, the investors sold shares prior to the expiration of the one-year holding period required by
Securities Act Rule 144 [17 C.F.R. § 230.144]. Bayside’s proceeds from its FSPM stock sales,
as well as the payment from the investors, were ultimately funneled to FSPM using Meadpoint as
an intermediary. FSPM used proceeds from the Bayside sales of stock and debt to fund its 2013
operations.
16.
Between approximately March 2013 and April 2014, pursuant to the Meadpoint
convertible note, Meadpoint converted $42,450 of debt into 4.245 million FSPM common
shares, and then sold into the market approximately 3.2 million of those shares. In order to
facilitate the sales, Sears and Dittman made false statements to brokers and the transfer agent
about Meadpoint’s purported non-affiliate status. In August 2013, Meadpoint also converted
$15,000 of fake debt into 1.5 million shares and then sold them to three investors. The investors
received unrestricted shares on the basis of, again, Dittman’s and Sears’ false representations of
Meadpoint’s non-affiliate status. In 2013, Meadpoint’s stock sale proceeds and payments from
the investors funded FSPM operations. In 2014, Meadpoint’s proceeds from its note with FSPM
were $9.9 million. While some of this amount was transferred to FSPM, the majority, $8.7
million, was seized by criminal authorities in May 2014.
FSPM Falsely Reports Proceeds From Stock Sales As Revenue and Issues
Additional False and Misleading Statements
17.
While Dittman and Sears were facilitating the transfer of unrestricted FSPM
shares to Sears through his entities, Sears illegally sold those shares into the market and roundtripped some of the proceeds back to FSPM. FSPM, through Dittman and Sears, reported false
revenues and made false statements about sales of PharmPods in press releases, which in turn
maintained and/or increased FSPM’s stock price and volume, and allowed Sears to sell his
FSPM stock into the market. The false financial statements and revenue reported by FSPM were
included in: (1) FSPM’s 2011 annual report (including its financial statements and notes to the
financial statements), signed by Dittman and posted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.’s website;
(2) FSPM’s 2012 annual report, signed by Dittman and posted on the OTC website; and (3)
FSPM’s 2013 annual report, signed by Dittman and posted on the OTC website.
18.
FSPM also claimed to have sold PharmPods to certain Sears’ entities, including to
Meadpoint and another Sears entity, but failed to disclose these transactions, as well as the
Bayside and Meadpoint notes, as related party transactions. FSPM’s Information and Disclosure
5

Statement for the period ended September 30, 2011, and its 2011 and 2012 annual reports, all
signed by Dittman and posted on the OTC website, falsely stated there were no related party
transactions. Further, none of FSPM’s other quarterly reports or its 2013 annual report posted on
the OTC website disclosed related party transactions..

21.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent willfully aided and abetted

Respondent also agreed to plead guilty to filing a false federal individual income tax return for
calendar year 2011 [26 U.S.C. § 7206(1)].
IV.
Pursuant to this Order, Respondent agrees to additional proceedings in this proceeding to
determine what, if any, disgorgement pursuant to Section 8A(e) of the Securities Act and Section
21C(e) of the Exchange Act and/or civil penalties pursuant to Section 8A(g) of the Securities Act

proceedings on the basis of affidavits, declarations, excerpts of sworn deposition or investigative
testimony, and documentary evidence. It is further Ordered that, for purposes of exceptions to
discharge set forth in Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this
Order are true and admitted by Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment
interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other
judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this
proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondent of the federal securities laws or any
regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
