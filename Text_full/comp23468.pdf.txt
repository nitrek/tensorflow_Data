COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action against PV Enterprises, Inc. (“PVEC”) and

Panagiotis (Peter) Villiotis (“Villiotis”) for violations of the registration and antifraud provisions
of the federal securities laws.
2.

The Commission brings this action against Virtual Sourcing, Inc. (“Virtual”),

Norman Birmingham (“Birmingham”), Mario Faraone (“Faraone”), and Sweet Challenge, LLC
a/k/a Sweet Challenge, Inc. (“Sweet Challenge”) for violations of the registration provisions of
the federal securities laws.

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 2 of 25

3.

PVEC and Virtual each entered into business transactions with a specific

financing company (“Financing Company”) which resulted in the companies issuing millions of
shares of their companies’ stock to the Financing Company in violation of the registration
provisions of the federal securities laws.
4.

Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) prohibits the sale of

securities unless the securities are registered with the Commission or are exempt from
registration.
5.

The stock that PVEC and Virtual sold to the Financing Company was not

registered with the Commission; rather, the companies attempted to rely on an exemption found
in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. In relevant part, Section 3(a)(10) exempts securities
issued in court-approved exchanges for “bona fide outstanding securities, claims, or property
interests.”
6.

To avoid registration, PVEC and Virtual sold outstanding debt liabilities to the

Financing Company; the Financing Company then sued PVEC and Virtual in a Florida state
court for defaulting on its obligations, and the parties settled the action by requesting the state
court allow PVEC and Virtual to pay the creditor in company shares that would be exempt from
registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(10).
7.

In seeking the Florida state court’s approval, both PVEC and Virtual made

material misstatements and withheld significant information, thereby rendering the Section
3(a)(10) exemption unavailable for any related stock issuances to the Financing Company.
2

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 3 of 25

8.

In pursuit of receiving settlement approval from the court to issue shares to the

Financing Company, PVEC lied to the Florida state court by misrepresenting that the underlying
claims sold to the Financing Company were bona fide, when, in fact, the claims were fabricated
by PVEC. PVEC also represented that none of the money received by its purported creditors
would be kicked back to PVEC, when, in fact, a majority of the money received by the purported
creditors was kicked back to PVEC and Villiotis.
9.

In pursuit of receiving settlement approval from the Florida state court to issue

shares to the Financing Company, Virtual misrepresented that it and its creditor, Sweet
Challenge, were not under the common control of Birmingham, and also misrepresented that
funds received by Sweet Challenge would not be kicked back to Virtual and Virtual employees,
including Faraone.
10.

The omissions and misrepresentations by PVEC and Virtual rendered the Section

3(a)(10) exemption unavailable for the related stock issuances to the Financing Company and, as
a result, the unregistered distributions of those securities to the Financing Company violated
Section 5 of the Securities Act.
11.

PVEC and Villiotis also violated the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws in

making the material misstatements and omissions concerning the bona fide nature of the claims
and the kickbacks in connection with the sales of securities to the Financing Company. In
addition, PVEC and Villiotis omitted material information and made material misstatements in
press releases concerning and relating to the purported Section 3(a)(10) settlements.
3

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 4 of 25

12.

As a result of the conduct described in this Complaint, PVEC and Villiotis

violated Sections 5(a) and (c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15
U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), 77e(c), 77q(a)(1), 77q(a)(2), 77q(a)(3); and Sections 10(b), 15(a) and Rule
10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), 15 U.S.C. §
78o(a) and 117 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.
13.

As a result of the conduct described in this Complaint, Virtual, Birmingham,

Sweet Challenge, and Faraone violated Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§
77e(a) and 77e(c).
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d), 20(e),

20(g), and 2(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), 77t(e), 77t(g), and 77v(a); and
Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa.
15.

This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants and venue is proper in

the Southern District of Florida because many of the Defendants’ acts constituting violations of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act occurred in the District. More specifically, the
Defendants offered and sold unregistered securities to the Financing Company, which operates
out of Miami, and money received by each of the Defendants, in the form of either direct
payments from the Financing Company or kickbacks from the creditors, originated from the
Financing Company in Miami Beach. Moreover, Villiotis resides in the Southern District of

4

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 5 of 25

Florida, and PVEC, Villiotis, and the Financing Company conduct business from the Southern
District of Florida.
16.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, the Defendants, directly

and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, the means and instruments of transportation and communication in
interstate commerce, and the mails.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A.

PVEC’S ISSUANCE OF UNREGISTERED SHARES

24.

At all times relevant, PVEC was a Fort Lauderdale, Florida shipping and travel

company whose common stock was publicly traded on an “over the counter” market (aka the
“pink sheets”) under the symbol PVEC.
25.

At all times relevant, Villiotis was the President and CEO of PVEC.

26.

In November 2013, December 2013, and February 2014, PVEC, under the

direction of Villiotis, entered into agreements with a Financing Company pursuant to which
PVEC would issue shares of its common stock to the Financing Company in purported reliance
on a registration exemption found in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act.
27.

Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act exempts from registration securities issued

in court-approved exchanges for “bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests.”
28.

Pursuant to the agreements, the Financing Company purchased outstanding

liabilities owed by PVEC to various creditors. The Financing Company executed a Claim
Purchase Agreement with each creditor in which the Financing Company acquired immediate
assignment of the rights, title, and interest of the creditor in exchange for a future payment.
29.

After acquiring the past due liabilities from the creditors, and as agreed

beforehand by PVEC and the Financing Company, the Financing Company filed complaints
against PVEC in Sarasota County alleging that PVEC defaulted on its obligations to the creditors
and that PVEC is responsible and liable for the debts acquired by the Financing Company.
7

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 8 of 25

30.

As stated in a state court complaint filed in December 2013, the Financing

Company purchased and acquired the debt of PVEC in the amount of $20,809.53 owed by PVEC
to M&A International & Investments LLC (“M&A”) and the debt of PVEC in the amount of
$99.563.50 owed by PVEC to Vision Investments Enterprise Group, Inc. (“Vision”).
31.

As stated in a state court complaint filed in February 2014, the Financing

Company purchased and acquired the debt of PVEC in the amount of $52,680.74 owed by PVEC
to Alpha Vision Enterprises, Ltd. (“Alpha”).
32.

Each of the complaints filed with the state court attached purported copies of the

invoices evidencing the outstanding debts owed by PVEC to the creditors.
33.

Simultaneous to the filing of the state court complaints, PVEC and the Financing

Company submitted proposed settlement agreements to the court. The proposed settlement
agreements stipulated that PVEC would issue the Financing Company current and future shares
of its common stock as a substitute for repayment of the past due liabilities owed by PVEC to the
Financing Company.
34.

Each of the proposed settlement agreements notified the court of the parties’

reliance on Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act and specifically referenced that Section
3(a)(10) exempts from registration securities issued in court-approved exchanges for “bona fide
outstanding securities, claims, or property interests.” (emphasis added).
35.

Each of the proposed settlement agreements in state court stipulated the

following:
8

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 9 of 25

a.

“[Creditor] is not, directly or indirectly, utilizing any of the proceeds

received from [the Financing Company] for selling the Claims to provide any consideration to or
invest in any manner in the [PVEC] or any affiliate of the [PVEC].”
b.

“[PVEC] represents that each Claim being purchased pursuant hereto is a

bona-fide Claim against the Company and that the invoices or written contract(s)/promissory
notes underlying each Claim are accurate representations of the nature of the debt and the
amounts owed by [PVEC] to [Creditor].”
36.

Each of the proposed settlements was approved by the state court, after which

PVEC began issuing shares of its common stock to the financing pursuant to the settlement
agreements.
37.

In connection with the November 2013 settlement, PVEC issued more than 259

million shares of its common stock to the Financing Company over the course of one month. At
the time of entering into the November 2013 settlement agreement, PVEC had 1.58 billion shares
of common stock outstanding. Therefore, over the course of one month, PVEC’s common stock
outstanding increased by over 259 million, representing dilution of more than 15%.
38.

In connection with the December 2013 settlement, PVEC issued more than 2.28

billion shares of its common stock to the Financing Company, which diluted PVEC’s common
stock by more than 88 percent.

9

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 10 of 25

39.

In connection with the February 2014 settlement, PVEC issued more than 580

million shares of its common stock to the Financing Company, which diluted PVEC’s common
stock by more than 11 percent.
40.

In total, PVEC issued more than 2.8 billion shares of its common stock to the

Financing Company in unregistered transactions.
41.

In direct contrast to the representations made by PVEC to the state court in the

December 2013 and February 2014 settlement agreements, the M&A, Vision, and Alpha debt
obligations that were purchased by the Financing Company were not “bona fide” outstanding
liabilities. Rather, PVEC fabricated the invoices underlying the M&A, Vision, and Alpha
claims.
42.

PVEC manufactured the M&A invoice from scratch, including creating a fake

logo, using an incorrect address, and creating a statement of work that was completely false, (iv)
neither he nor anyone from M&A worked on an inspection report for PVEC, inspected a port in
Korea for PVEC, or travelled to Korea on behalf of PVEC (all of which were described as
services performed on the allegedly fake invoice).
43.

For the debt obligation purportedly owed to Vision, PVEC edited a quote received

from Vision, at the time a prospective supplier to PVEC, by literally changing the word “quote”
to “invoice” on a list of prices sent from Vision to Villiotis.
44.

Similarly, the debt obligation purportedly owed to Alpha was fabricated by

PVEC.
10

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 11 of 25

45.

Even though the three creditors’ claims referenced in herein were fake and not

“bona fide,” the Financing Company paid the creditors as if the claims were legitimate and real.
Unbeknownst to the Financing Company, Villiotis arranged that the “creditors” would receive
payment from the Financing Company, keep a small sum for themselves, and send the majority
of the funds received from the Financing Company back to PVEC and Villiotis, in direct
contravention of the stipulations made to the state court in the settlement agreements.
46.

As planned and in direct contrast to representations in the settlement agreements,

M&A, Vision, Alpha each utilized a portion of the funds received from the Financing Company
to send money directly to PVEC and Villiotis.
a.

Within two days of receiving a $28,000 payment from the Financing

Company, M&A transferred $20,000 to PVEC.
b.

Within two days of receiving a $90,000 payment from the Financing

Company, Vision’s principal “followed Mr. Villiotis’ explicit instructions” to distribute the funds
among three accounts: $40,000 to PVEC, $25,000 to a personal account of Villiotis, and $15,000
to another PVEC employee.
c.

On March 7, 2014, the Financing Company transferred $52,681 to Alpha’s

principal in satisfaction of the CPA and on March 12, 2014, Alpha’s principal sent a check to
PVEC for $45,000.
47.

There was no registration filed or in effect as to the securities issued by PVEC to

the Financing Company.
11

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 12 of 25

48.

The fabrication of the claims and the undisclosed kickbacks rendered the Section

3(a)(10) exemption unavailable for the related stock issuances by PVEC to the Financing
Company, causing the stock issuances to directly violate the registration requirements of the
federal securities laws.
49.

As CEO of PVEC, Villiotis directed and controlled PVEC’s sale of shares to the

Financing Company.
50.

Villiotis signed the settlement agreements between PVEC and the Financing

Company, he negotiated the settlement transactions on behalf of PVEC, he orchestrated the
fabrication of the underlying debt obligations and the kickbacks, and he personally received
kickbacks.
B.

PVEC’S MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS

51.

In connection with the offering of securities during the relevant period, PVEC and

Villiotis made the following material misrepresentations and omissions.
i.

Fabricated Debt Obligations and Undisclosed Kickbacks

52.

The fabricated debt obligations and the kickbacks were fraudulent representations

and/or omissions made in connection with the purchase and sale of securities.
53.

PVEC made representations in the settlement agreements about the “bona fide”

nature of the debt obligations and the use of funds received by the creditors that were materially
misleading and false.

12

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 13 of 25

54.

PVEC and Villiotis knew that the M&A, Vision, and Alpha invoices were fake

and contained incorrect information meant to mislead the Financing Company, the state court,
and the public.
55.

PVEC and Villiotis also misrepresented that the creditors would not kickback any

funds received from the Financing Company to PVEC or Villiotis, when, in fact, that was the
plan all along.
ii.

Misleading Press Releases

56.

At the same time PVEC was issuing billions of shares to the Financing Company,

a significant portion of which was premised on fraud, PVEC issued three press releases
describing its efforts to redeem or lower the amount of outstanding shares of PVEC stock. These
statements were materially misleading when made because they omitted information about the
issuance of billions of shares to the Financing Company.
57.

On November 13, 2013, less than one week after entering into a Section 3(a)(10)

settlement agreement with the Financing Company, PVEC issued a press release stating that
“Peter Villiotis, CEO of PV Enterprises International would like to inform shareholders and
interested parties alike as to recent corporate activities which have transpired over the past few
months…Many shareholders have corresponded with the Company expressing concern about the
increases in Authorized Shares and possibility of dilution to current shareholders… Let me
assure you that the Company has NO intention of diluting shareholders and is in fact initiating a
share buyback of up to 340 million shares via open market transactions.”

13

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 14 of 25

58.

The representations in the November 13, 2013 press release were false and

misleading. Villiotis knew, at the time of this press release, that PVEC would issue hundreds of
millions of unregistered shares to the Financing Company through a Section 3(a)(10) settlement.
59.

The November 13, 2013 press release also stated that a qualified investment

conglomerate, Evotech Capital, had purchased 1.2 billion shares of PVEC stock. This
representation was false. As of November 13, 2013, Evotech had not purchased any shares of
PVEC stock.
60.

On December 11, 2013, the same day that the Financing Company purchased the

debt of PVEC to consummate the December 2013 Section 3(a)(10) settlement, PVEC posted a
letter to shareholders from its CEO onto its company website stating that PVEC is “working to
redeem more than 500 million shares of stock” and “We will be filing corrective press releases to
clarify and correct disclosures that were included in prior press releases. Several press releases
were disseminated without our prior consent. As a result, we have terminated our relationship
with our public relations firm.”
61.

The representations were false. There had not been press releases disseminated

without Villiotis’ consent, PVEC never had a relationship with a public relations firm, and the
incorrect disclosures referred to in the letter were in fact drafted under Villiotis’ direction,
approved by Villiotis, and published to the company website by Villiotis.
62.

On January 27, 2014, PVEC issued another “Letter from the CEO” addressing the

company’s plans to lower the amount of outstanding shares of stock and stating, “I know you are
14

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 15 of 25

concerned for the future of the company and especially with the increase of our authorized
shares… As you’re aware the corporation is challenging and proceeding to retire 1,098,686,000
shares back to the treasure.” As of this date, the company had silently issued more than 1.5
billion shares to the Financing Company, making the January 27, 2014 statement materially
misleading.
63.

Throughout the relevant period, Villiotis served as PVEC’s President and CEO

and was responsible for the contents of PVEC’s press releases. Villiotis authorized the issuance
of and/or published all three press releases.
64.

From November 7, 2013 through May 15, 2014, while PVEC was issuing new

shares to the Financing Company, the daily closing price of PVEC common stock dropped from
$.0016 to $.0003.
C.

VIRTUAL’S ISSUANCE OF UNREGISTERED SHARES

65.

At all times relevant, Virtual was purportedly in the business of acquiring

companies and developing products in the waste management market. Its common stock was
publicly traded on an “over the counter” market (aka the “pink sheets”) under the symbol PGCX.
66.

At all times relevant, Birmingham was in control of and managed the day-to-day

operations of Virtual.
67.

From March 2012 until June 2013, Birmingham served as President and Director

of Virtual. On June 4, 2013, Birmingham publicly resigned from all positions held with Virtual;
however, Birmingham remained intimately involved in the company, including but not limited to
15

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 16 of 25

appointing putative officers and directors and, at all relevant times, operating sole control over
Virtual’s telephones, email accounts, and bank accounts.
68.

Sweet Challenge purported to provide accounting and auditing services to Virtual.

At all times relevant, Birmingham was the listed registered agent for Sweet Challenge’s charter.
69.

In March 2013, Sweet Challenge purportedly entered into an agreement to provide

consulting services to Allied Recycling Corp. (“Allied”), a subsidiary of Virtual. The consulting
agreement stipulated that Sweet Challenge would provide six services to Allied in exchange for
$12,500 per month “to be paid at the discretion of [Allied] in free restricted (sic) trading shares
or cash or a combination of both.” The scope of services to be provided by Sweet Challenge
included (1) “providing personnel for accounting, compliance, and tax filings…the operation of
[Allied] until properly staffed will be the responsibility of Consultant;” (2) assist in locating
profession parties to form advisory boards; (3) review all regulatory filings; (4) identify and
present to [Allied] board parties who meet a predefined model for financing; (5) provide all
record keeping; (6) report directly to Board and supply advice and expertise.
70.

In or around February 2014, Birmingham represented Virtual in negotiating a

Section 3(a)(10) settlement transaction between Virtual and the Financing Company.
Birmingham, and Birmingham alone, represented Virtual in an introductory phone call with the
Financing Company to discuss the prospective transaction, and Birmingham unilaterally
communicated with the Financing Company, on behalf of Virtual, in setting up the paperwork for
the transaction.
16

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 17 of 25

71.

On February 26 and 27, 2014, the Financing Company executed Claim Purchase

Agreements with two Virtual creditors through which the Financing Company agreed to purchase
outstanding debt obligations owed by Virtual totaling $178,500, including $162,500 owed to
Sweet Challenge as a result of unpaid fees associated with the consulting agreement.
72.

On February 27, 2014, and as agreed beforehand by the Financing Company and

Birmingham, the Financing Company filed a state court complaint against Virtual in Sarasota
County alleging that Virtual defaulted on its obligations to Sweet Challenge and the other
creditor and that Virtual is responsible and liable for the debts acquired by the Financing
Company.
73.

Simultaneous to the filing of the complaint, Virtual and the Financing Company

submitted a proposed settlement agreement to the state court. The proposed settlement agreement
stipulated that Virtual would issue the Financing Company current and future shares of its
common stock as a substitute for repayment of the past due liabilities owed by Virtual to the
Financing Company.
74.

The proposed settlement agreement notified the state court of the parties’ reliance

on Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act, contained a provision prohibiting Sweet Challenge
from passing the proceeds received from the Financing Company back to Virtual, and explicitly
stipulated that Sweet Challenge was not and within the past 90 days had not been under common
control with Virtual.
75.

The settlement agreement stated the following:
17

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 18 of 25

a.

Sweet Challenge “was not and within the past ninety days has not been

directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries in control, controlled by, or under
common control, with [Virtual Sourcing] and is not an affiliate of [Virtual Sourcing] as defined
in Rule 144,” and
b.

“To the best of [Virtual Sourcing]’s knowledge, [Sweet Challenge] is not,

directly or indirectly, utilizing any of the proceeds received from IBC for selling the Claims to
provide any consideration to or invest in any manner in [Virtual Sourcing] or any affiliate of
[Virtual Sourcing].”
76.

The proposed settlement was approved by the state court, after which Virtual

began issuing shares of its common stock to the Financing Company pursuant to the settlement
agreement.
77.

In connection with the February 2014 settlement, Virtual issued more than 88

million shares of its common stock to the Financing Company. At the time of entering into the
February 2014 settlement agreement, Virtual had 93.89 million shares of common stock
outstanding. Therefore, the more than 80 million shares issued to the Financing Company
diluted Virtual’s common stock by more than 85 percent.
78.

In direct contrast to the representations made by Virtual to the state court in the

February 2014 settlement, both Sweet Challenge and Virtual were under the common control of
Birmingham, and Sweet Challenge utilized proceeds received from the Financing Company to
provide consideration to Virtual.
18

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 19 of 25

i.

Birmingham’s Control Over Both Sweet Challenge and Virtual

79.

Birmingham, at all times relevant, controlled Sweet Challenge.

80.

Birmingham unilaterally performed all the Sweet Challenge work and had sole

signature authority for Sweet Challenge’s bank account.
81.

Birmingham, at all times relevant, also controlled Virtual.

82.

Birmingham ran the day to day operations for Virtual. Birmingham exercised

unilateral control over Virtual’s bank account and email account, answered phone calls placed to
Virtual, attended Virtual board meetings, nominated individuals as members of Virtual’s board,
unilaterally sought out investments for Virtual, drafted and posted press releases for Virtual, and
through his company Sweet Challenge, even paid the salary of Virtual employees as well as
Virtual legal and administrative expenses and auditor fees.
83.

Virtual currently maintains its official place of business at the residential

apartment of Adam Birmingham, Birmingham’s son. As of January 2015, all the corporate
records for Virtual were located at Birmingham’s residence in Maryland.
84.

In June 2013, Birmingham appointed Faraone as the purported President of

Virtual. However, as of June 1, 2013 and continuing through June 1, 2014, Faraone had a full
time job with Citi as a mortgage collector, and Faraone did not perform any operational duties as
President of Virtual aside from signing the settlement agreement on behalf of Virtual that
enabled Virtual to the Finance Company pursuant to Section 3(a)(10). Faraone signed the

19

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 20 of 25

agreement under Birmingham’s instruction and also attended board phone calls set up and
attended by Birmingham.
85.

Despite his purported role as president of Virtual, Faraone had no control over or

access to Virtual’s bank accounts. He could not draft checks or withdraw funds.
ii.

Sweet Challenge’s Kickbacks to Virtual

86.

In direct contrast to the representation to the state court in the settlement

agreement, Sweet Challenge utilized a portion of the funds received from the Financing
Company to send money directly to Virtual and Faraone.
87.

On March 13, 2014, Sweet Challenge received a wire transfer from the Financing

Company for $81,250.
88.

On March 14, 2014, Sweet Challenge transferred $1,000 into the bank account of

Mario Faraone, wrote Virtual a check for $5,000, and paid $1,000 to a law firm for a legal
opinion letter for Virtual.
89.

Sweet Challenge also wrote checks to Virtual for $1,600 on March 31, 2014, for

$5,000 on April 24, 2014, and for $3,400 on June 12, 2014.
90.

In September and October of 2014, Sweet Challenge made a total of $10,000 in

payments to Virtual’s auditor.
91.

In December 2014, Virtual entered into a second Section 3(a)(10) settlement

transaction with the Financing Company to settle an additional debt purportedly owed to Sweet

20

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 21 of 25

Challenge. The parties filed settlement documents with the same state court outlining terms
analogous to the February 2014 settlement agreement.
92.

In connection with the December 2014 settlement, Virtual issued more than 63

million shares of its common stock to the Financing Company. At the time of entering into the
December 2014 settlement agreement, Virtual had 180 million shares of common stock
outstanding. Therefore, the more than 63 million shares issued to the Financing Company
diluted Virtual’s common stock by approximately 35 percent.
93.

There was no registration filed or in effect as to the securities issued by Virtual to

the Financing Company.
94.

The omissions and misrepresentations concerning common control and use of

funds rendered the Section 3(a)(10) exemption unavailable for the related stock issuances by
Virtual to the Financing Company, causing the stock issuances to directly violate the registration
requirements of the federal securities laws.
95.

Sweet Challenge sold the debt obligations to the Financing Company that formed

the basis of the Section 3(a)(10) settlement transactions, and Sweet Challenge misrepresented
that it was not affiliated with Virtual, that it and Virtual were not under the common control of
Birmingham, and that it would not kickback funds received from the Financing Company to
Virtual.
96.

Birmingham controlled both Virtual and Sweet Challenge, orchestrated the

3(a)(10) settlement transactions on Virtual’s behalf, communicated with the Financing Company
21

Case 1:16-cv-20542-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/16/2016 Page 22 of 25

concerning the transactions, instructed Faraone to sign the settlement agreements, and directed a
portion of the proceeds received by Sweet Challenge back to Virtual.
97.

Faraone signed the settlement agreements on behalf of Virtual and concealed

Birmingham’s common control over both Virtual and Sweet Challenge.
