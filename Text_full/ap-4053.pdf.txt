ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 4053/August 9, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17070
In the Matter of
3C ADVISORS & ASSOCIATES, INC.,
STEPHEN JONES, AND
DAVID PROLMAN

ORDER

Yesterday, I held a telephonic prehearing conference to discuss the Division of
Enforcement’s motion to permit the deposition of Carolyn Kling due to her unavailability to
appear at the hearing in this matter. In attendance were the Division and counsel for
Respondents Stephen Jones and 3C Advisors & Associates, Inc. For reasons discussed during
the conference, I denied the Division’s motion.
The parties have stipulated that David Luvisa may appear at the hearing by
videoconference. The stipulation is accepted.
The Division has requested a hearing subpoena directed to Respondent Stephen Jones.
Although I have signed subpoenas directed to respondents in the past, there is no apparent reason
why the requested subpoena was not among the Division’s other hearing subpoenas, which I
signed on August 4, 2016. The request is denied as superfluous. Jones is expected to appear at
his own hearing; if he does not, he may be held in default.
SO ORDERED.
