Payam Danialypour and Donald Searles for the
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission
Brian J. Ourand, pro se

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision concludes that Brian J. Ourand violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2)
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act) by misappropriating funds from advisory
client accounts. The Initial Decision imposes a cease-and-desist order; orders disgorgement of
$671,367 plus prejudgment interest; orders a $300,000 civil penalty; and bars Ourand from the
securities industry.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on June 15, 2015, pursuant to Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the
Advisers Act and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company
Act). The undersigned held a two-day hearing in Washington, D.C., on December 14-15, 2015.
The Division of Enforcement (Division) called seven witnesses from whom testimony was taken.
Numerous exhibits were admitted into evidence.1

Citations to the transcript will be noted as “Tr. __.” Citations to exhibits offered by the
Division will be noted as “Div. Ex. __.” Respondent Ourand did not offer any exhibits or call
any witnesses.

The findings and conclusions in this Initial Decision are based on the record and public
official records of which official notice has been taken, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323.
Preponderance of the evidence was applied as the standard of proof. See Steadman v. SEC, 450
U.S. 91, 96-104 (1981). Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 557(c), the
following post-hearing pleadings were considered: (1) the Division’s Post-Hearing Brief, filed
January 29, 2016; (2) Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, filed January 29, 2016; and (3) the
Division’s Reply, filed February 12, 2016. All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions
that are inconsistent with this Initial Decision were considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
This proceeding concerns Ourand’s dealings with three investment advisory clients of his
employer, SFX Financial Advisory Management Enterprises, Inc. The OIP alleges that Ourand
misappropriated over $670,000 from three SFX client accounts. The Division is seeking a ceaseand-desist order, disgorgement, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar. Ourand argues that this
administrative proceeding should have been stayed pending the outcome of the criminal
proceeding against him and states his belief that “in the SEC Court, where the SEC is the judge,
the jury, and the prosecutor, it is blatantly obvious that the SEC gets the benefit of the doubt, not
the Respondent.”
C. Procedural Issues
1. No Adverse Inference from Refusal to Testify
Ourand invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when called by the
Division to testify at the hearing.2 An adverse inference may be drawn from a respondent’s
refusal to testify in a Commission administrative proceeding. See Pagel, Inc. v. SEC, 803 F.2d
942, 946-47 (8th Cir. 1986); N. Sims Organ & Co., Inc. v. SEC, 293 F.2d 78, 80-81 (2d Cir.
1961); see also Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 319 (1976) (Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination does not forbid drawing adverse inferences from an inmate’s failure to
testify at his own disciplinary proceedings). Nonetheless, no adverse inference has been drawn
from Ourand’s refusal to testify. The findings and conclusions herein are based on the evidence
that was adduced, without regard to Ourand’s silence.
2. Unfairness
Ourand urges that the Commission’s administrative proceedings are inherently unfair to
respondents since both the administrative law judge (ALJ) and the prosecutor are Commission
employees. This overlooks the safeguards regarding separation of functions provided in the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which has been in effect for almost seventy years. See
Sections 554(c), (d) and 556 of the APA; see also Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 513-14

2

In fact, he declined to offer any evidence at all, fearing a potential impact on the criminal case
against him.

2

(1976) (pursuant to the APA, the ALJ exercises independent judgment on the evidence, free from
pressures by the parties or other officials within the agency).
3. Stay
Ourand argues that this proceeding should have been stayed pending the outcome of
United States v. Ourand, 1:15-cr-182 (D.D.C.). However, as the undersigned previously ruled,
the Commission’s rules do not authorize the undersigned to grant such a stay pending the
outcome of a criminal matter at the request of a party.3
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
A. Relevant Individuals and Entities
1. SFX and Ourand
During the period 2006-2011, SFX was a Commission-registered investment adviser
located in Washington, D.C.4 Tr. 8, 13. Its clients were mostly professional athletes. Tr. 16. In
addition to investment advisory services, SFX provided such services as tax work; bill paying;
finding, purchasing, and financing homes; facilitating major purchases such as cars and
insurance; and anything of a financial nature that clients requested. Tr. 16.
Ourand started working for a predecessor to SFX in 1988. Tr. 111. Ourand was
president of SFX from 2007 until his termination from the company in 2011; prior to 2007 he
was a vice-president.5 Tr. 14-16; Div. Ex. 6 at 1-2; Div. Ex. 9 at 23. During the time at issue,
Ourand received a salary and additional compensation based on the revenue his clients
generated. Tr. 21.
For bill paying, SFX opened client accounts at the SunTrust Bank; Ourand had signature
authority over his clients’ bank accounts so that he would have the authority to write checks to
pay their bills. Tr. 23, 39, 114, 119. He also had discretionary authority over the clients’
brokerage accounts. Tr. 114, 117-119. The account statements for the bank and brokerage

Brian J. Ourand, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3384, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3384 (A.L.J.
Dec. 9, 2015) (“An authorized representative of a United States Attorney may ‘request[] a stay
during the pendency of a criminal investigation or prosecution arising out of the same or similar
facts at issue in the pending Commission [administrative] proceeding.’ 17 C.F.R. §
201.210(c)(3). The United States Attorney prosecuting United States v. Ourand has not done
so.”)
4

Currently, SFX is registered with the District of Columbia; its assets are below the threshold for
Commission registration. Tr. 13.
5

Ourand testified that he was vice president, but never president. Tr. 112. However, SFX’s
Form ADV, filed on March 4, 2008, represents that he became president in March 2007. Div.
Ex. 9 at 23. In any event, the issue of whether he was president is immaterial to this proceeding.

accounts were sent to SFX’s office, not to the clients. Tr. 114, 148, 157, 164, 180, 243, 251,
257-58, 274.
Eugene Mason is, and was during the relevant period, SFX’s vice president of finance
and chief compliance officer. Tr. 12-13. The events at issue came to light in July 2011 when
Mason received a late-night phone call from Ourand client Dikembe Mutombo, who complained
that his American Express card had been declined and that American Express told him that the
card was behind in payment and that there was activity on the card in Ourand’s name. Tr. 34,
151-52. The next day Mason confronted Ourand and determined that Ourand had a card in his
name on the Mutombo account. Tr. 35. SFX placed Ourand on a leave of absence, and Mason
told Ourand to hand over his security card and office keys and to leave. Tr. 35-36. That same
day Mason told SunTrust Bank not to negotiate checks signed by Ourand for any client accounts
and learned that Ourand had already presented a check drawn on a client account for his own
benefit. Tr. 36-37. SFX’s parent company, Live Nation, immediately initiated an internal
investigation concerning Ourand’s activities in client accounts. Tr. 37.
William Bradley Nelson, the head of Live Nation’s internal audit, conducted the
investigation. Tr. 38, 70, 72. The audit team investigated each account to which Ourand had
access, and evaluated each transaction in the accounts to a point back in time where there had
been twelve months of no questionable activity. Tr. 74. For one client, this was as far back as
2003, but most were from 2007 to 2010. Tr. 75. They found numerous transactions made out to
Ourand, made out to cash and signed by Ourand, or transferred from the client’s account to
Ourand’s personal account at SunTrust Bank, as well as credit card transactions that were
personal to Ourand made on the clients’ credit card accounts. Tr. 75, 77. Nelson also
interviewed Ourand in the investigation and confronted him with documentary evidence of
questionable transactions. Tr. 77-106, 124, 129-30; Div. Ex. 25. Ourand was terminated on
August 16, 2011. Tr. 90, 111, 128; Div. Ex. 25 at 4. Live Nation/SFX repaid to the clients the
funds taken from them, having reached agreement or settlement of a lawsuit with each client as
to the amount. Tr. 40-41, 53-54, 153-54, 248.
2. Ourand’s Clients
Ourand’s clients included Dikembe Mutombo, Glen Rice, and Michael Tyson. Tr. 25;
Div. Exs. 10, 13, 15-16.
a. Dikembe Mutombo
Dikembe Mutombo is a retired professional basketball player. Tr. 143. His current
activities include the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation, which funds humanitarian work in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he was born. Tr. 144-45. He became a client of SFX
in 1991, when he graduated from college and started playing basketball professionally. Tr. 146.
The Mutombo Foundation also received services from SFX. Tr. 147. Ourand provided SFX’s
services to Mutombo and the Mutombo Foundation during 2006-2011. Tr. 147. Mutombo
spoke to Ourand on the telephone three or four times a week. Tr. 149. The services for
Mutombo personally and the Mutombo Foundation included bill paying, investments, and tax
preparation. Tr. 147-49.

4

Mutombo did not engage Ourand directly, outside of his contract with SFX, to provide
any services; nor did he authorize Ourand to take money out of his accounts for his personal use.
Tr. 149-50. Specifically, he did not authorize Ourand to transfer money to persons whom
Mutombo did not know and charge the transfers to a Mutombo credit card. Tr. 158-63; Div. Exs.
301-10. Nor did he authorize Ourand to write checks to himself from the Mutombo
Foundation’s Bank of America account. Tr. 164-71; Div. Exs. 311-17.
b. Glen Rice
Glen Rice is a retired professional basketball player. Tr. 176-77. During the time at
issue, he was an owner of G-Force Promotions, LLC. Tr. 177-78. He became a client of SFX in
1994 or 1995. Tr. 179. Ourand provided SFX’s services to Rice. Tr. 179. Rice spoke to
Ourand every day and “considered him a really good friend . . . . one of my best friends.” Tr.
182. The services provided included bill paying and tax preparation pursuant to Rice’s written
contract with SFX. Tr. 179-80. Rice did not engage Ourand directly, outside of his contract
with SFX, to provide any services. Tr. 180-82, 192. At one point Ourand told Rice he was
having financial difficulties, but Rice did not loan Ourand any money or authorize him to take
money out of his account as a loan. Tr. 187-88, 205-06. After SFX informed Rice that Ourand
had been stealing from him, Ourand suggested that they play golf. Tr. 224. Unsurprisingly, Rice
did not accept the golf invitation. Tr. 224-25.
c. Michael and Lakiha Tyson
Michael Tyson is a former world heavyweight boxing champion. Tr. 228. Currently he
is involved in the entertainment industry. Tr. 227-28. His business is conducted through
Tyrannic, LLC, jointly owned by Tyson and his wife, Lakiha Tyson. Tr. 228-29, 237. Tyson
does not consider himself adept at financial matters, noting that he filed for bankruptcy in 2003.
Tr. 229. As a result, he engaged SFX. Tr. 229-30. Ourand provided financial services for the
Tysons and Tyrannic, including between 2009 and 2011. Tr. 230, 238-39. Tyson did not engage
Ourand directly, outside of his contract with SFX, to provide any services; nor did he authorize
Ourand to take money out of Tyson accounts for Ourand’s personal use. Tr. 233-34. Tyson
trusted Ourand. Tr. 233.
Lakiha Tyson, Tyson’s wife and business partner, was the contact for the Tyson interests
with Ourand. Tr. 232-33, 239-40, 259, 275-76. Mrs. Tyson spoke with Ourand a few times a
week. Tr. 245. She felt comfortable with him. Tr. 245. She did not engage Ourand directly,
outside of his contract with SFX, to provide any services; nor did she authorize Ourand to take
money out of Tyson accounts for Ourand’s personal use. Tr. 238-39, 243-44, 253-80. After
being fired, Ourand told her that he was leaving SFX because he did not like the working
conditions and asked her to sign a form to enable him to continue servicing the Tyson account.6
Tr. 245-46.

6

Mason emailed Mrs. Tyson that he would be taking over Ourand’s accounts without disclosing
the reason for the change. Tr. 246-47. Later he sent her a letter summarizing inappropriate
5

B. Ourand’s Misappropriation of Client Funds
Ourand took funds from client accounts by such means as writing checks payable to cash,
wire transfers, telephone transfers, ATM transactions, and debit card transactions, as well as
credit card transactions that were personal to Ourand made on the clients’ credit card accounts.
Tr. 67-68, 77, 88.
1. Mutombo
From September 2006 to July 2009, Ourand misappropriated $90,548 from Mutombo and
the Mutombo Foundation. Div. Ex. 456; see Div. Exs. 301-17; Tr. 290-93.
Ourand misappropriated money from a Citibank MasterCard account in Mutombo’s
name, as well as from a Bank of America account in the name of the Mutombo Foundation. Tr.
291. From the Bank of America account in the name of the Mutombo Foundation, Ourand wrote
seven checks to himself that he both signed and endorsed, between September 19, 2006, and
September 5, 2008. Tr. 292; Div. Exs. 311-17. From October 31, 2008, to July 31, 2009,
Ourand made ten Western Union transfers from the Citibank MasterCard account to Danielle
Sliva and Christopher Maris.7 Tr. 291-92; Exs. 301-10.
Mutombo did not authorize any of these money transfers or checks. Tr. 162, 169-71; see
Tr. 65, 104-05.
2. Rice
From August 2006 to March 2011, Ourand misappropriated $353,383 from Rice and GForce. Div. Ex. 457; see Div. Exs. 401-53; Tr. 293-96.
Ourand misappropriated money from one account in the name of G-Force and two in
Rice’s; he also deposited a check made payable to Rice in his own account. Tr. 188-90, 293.
With regard to one of the accounts in Rice’s name, between August 9, 2006, and November 18,
2010: (1) Ourand wrote checks to himself and to cash; (2) transferred money to his own bank
account; and (3) made a transfer to Christopher Maris. Tr. 294-95; Div. Exs. 406-26. With
regard to the second account in Rice’s name, between April 1, 2009, and February 28, 2011,
Ourand wrote checks to himself, to cash, and to Rice, and made two wire transfers to his own
account. Tr. 295-96; Div. Exs. 427-53. The checks written to Rice were deposited into
Ourand’s account, and those written out to cash were endorsed by Ourand. Tr. 295; Div. Exs.
409, 418, 427-28, 432-41, 449-51. Regarding the G-Force account, between June 18, 2010, and
October 5, 2010, Ourand wrote four checks to himself that he endorsed, and he signed all but one
of them. Tr. 294; Div. Exs. 402-05. Finally, on March 9, 2011, Ourand forged Rice’s signature
transactions in the Tyson accounts. Tr. 246-47. The Tysons sued SFX and Live Nation, and
reached a settlement; they no longer use SFX’s services. Tr. 248.
7

Sliva and Maris were friends of Ourand’s. Tr. 24-25, 92.

6

and endorsed a check from Robert P. Frankel & Associates, P.A., payable to Rice for $4,900 and
deposited it in his own account. Tr. 188-90; Div. Ex. 401.
Rice did not authorize any of these money transfers or checks. Tr. 188-225; see Tr. 6566, 104-05.
3. The Tysons
From August 2009 to June 2011, Ourand misappropriated $227,436 from the Tysons and
Tyrannic. Div. Ex 455; see Div. Exs. 201-44, 246-57; Tr. 285-90.
Ourand misappropriated money from three accounts belonging to the Tysons: two

through June 24, 2011, using an account in Tyson’s name, Ourand wrote checks to himself and
to cash and made bank transfers to his own account. Tr. 288-89; Div. Exs. 224-44. All of the
checks were signed by, and endorsed by, Ourand. Tr. 289; Div. Exs. 224-41. From May 28,
2010, through June 16, 2011, Ourand made twenty-three money transfers to his own bank

regard to a third account held by Tyrannic, Ourand made twelve checks to himself between
August 18, 2010, and June 24, 2011. Tr. 289-90; Exs. 246-57.
The Tysons did not authorize any of these money transfers or checks. Tr. 253-81; see Tr.
64, 104-05.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
The OIP charges violations of the antifraud provisions of the Advisers Act. Specifically,
the OIP charges that Ourand willfully violated, or, in the alternative, willfully aided and abetted
and caused violations of, Sections 206(1) and (2) of the Advisers Act. As discussed below, it is
concluded that Ourand willfully violated those provisions. Thus, it is unnecessary to consider
the alternate charge, based on the same facts, of secondary liability.
A. Antifraud Provisions
Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2) make it unlawful for any investment adviser, by
jurisdictional means, respectively to: (1) employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any
client or prospective client; or (2) engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business
which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client.
1. Scienter
Scienter is required to establish violations of Advisers Act Section 206(1). SEC v.
Steadman, 967 F.2d 636, 641 & n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1992). It is “a mental state embracing intent to
deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Aaron, 446 U.S. at 686 n.5; Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425
U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976); SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d at 641. Recklessness can satisfy the
scienter requirement. See SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d at 641-42; David Disner, Exchange Act

7

Release No. 38234, 1997 SEC LEXIS 258, at *15 & n.20 (Feb. 4, 1997). Reckless conduct is
“conduct which is ‘highly unreasonable’ and which represents ‘an extreme departure from the
standards of ordinary care . . . to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or
so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.’” Rolf v. Blyth, Eastman Dillon & Co.,
Inc., 570 F.2d 38, 47 (2d Cir. 1978) (quoting Sanders v. John Nuveen & Co., 554 F.2d 790, 793
(7th Cir. 1977)).
Scienter is not required to establish a violation of Advisers Act Section 206(2); a showing
of negligence is adequate. See SEC v. Steadman, 967 F.2d at 643 & n.5. Negligence is the
failure to exercise reasonable care. IFG Network Secs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 54127,
2006 SEC LEXIS 1600, at *37 (July 11, 2006).
2. Willfulness
Respondent is charged with willful primary or secondary violations, of Advisers Act
Sections 206(1) and 206(2). A finding of willfulness does not require an intent to violate the
law, but merely an intent to do the act which constitutes a violation. See Steadman v. SEC, 603
F.2d 1126, 1135 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981); Tager v. SEC, 344
F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965).
3. Fiduciary Standard
As an officer and employee of SFX, Ourand was an associated person of an investment
adviser. See Advisers Act Sections 202(a)(17), 203(f). Ourand was also an investment adviser
within the meaning of Advisers Act Section 202(11) in that he “for compensation, engage[d] in
the business of advising others . . . as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of
investing in, purchasing, or selling securities.” Investment advisers and their associated persons
are fiduciaries. Fundamental Portfolio Advisors, Inc., 2003 SEC LEXIS 1654, at *54; see
Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 191-92, 194, 201 (1963); see also
Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 17 (1979). An investment adviser
owes a duty to act “in a manner consistent with the best interest of [his] client and . . . not
subrogate client interests to [his] own.” James C. Dawson, Advisers Act Release No. 3057, 2010
SEC LEXIS 2561, at * 8 (July 23, 2010) (alterations in original).
4. Primary Liability
As discussed below, the undersigned has concluded that Ourand violated Advisers Act
Sections 206(1) and 206(2). Thus it is unnecessary to address, in the alternative, his secondary
liability for violating those provisions.
B. Antifraud Violations
Ourand violated Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2) by stealing funds from his
advisory clients’ account by various means, including checks payable to cash, wire transfers,
forged checks, and credit card charges. The proven misconduct occurred between August 2006
and June 2011. Ourand’s scienter is obvious. The clients were unaware of Ourand’s fraud

8

because their bank, brokerage, and credit card account statements were sent to SFX and they did
not receive copies. The scheme might have continued indefinitely had Ourand not run up
excessive unpaid charges on Mutombo’s credit card, causing the card to be declined when
Mutombo tried to use it. Ourand’s intent to defraud even continued after the misconduct at issue
was stopped – he gave a false explanation to Mrs. Tyson for his departure from SFX and
attempted to have her sign a form that would enable him to continue handling the Tysons’
accounts.
IV. SANCTIONS
The Division requests a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement, a civil monetary penalty,
and a bar. As discussed below, the following will be ordered: a cease-and-desist order;
disgorgement of $671,367 plus prejudgment interest; civil penalties of $300,000; and an industry
bar.
A. Sanction Considerations
In determining sanctions, the Commission considers such factors as:
the egregiousness of the [respondent’s] actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of
the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the [respondent’s]
assurances against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful
nature of his conduct, and the likelihood that the [respondent’s] occupation will
present opportunities for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d at 1140 (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334 n.29 (5th Cir.
1978)). The Commission also considers the age of the violation and the degree of harm to
investors and the marketplace resulting from the violation. Marshall E. Melton, Exchange Act
Release No. 48228, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *4-5 (July 25, 2003). Additionally, the
Commission considers the extent to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect. Schield
Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at *35-36 & n.46 (Jan. 31,
2006). As the Commission has often emphasized, the public interest determination extends to
the public-at-large, the welfare of investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities
business generally. See Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act Release No. 2052, 2002
SEC LEXIS 2346, at *20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur Lipper
Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). The
amount of a sanction depends on the facts of each case and the value of the sanction in
preventing a recurrence. See Leo Glassman, Exchange Act Release No. 11929, 1975 SEC
LEXIS 111, at *7 (Dec. 16, 1975).
B. Cease and Desist
Advisers Act Section 203(k) authorizes the Commission to issue a cease-and-desist order
against a person who “is violating, has violated, or is about to violate” any provision of the
Advisers Act or who “is, was, or would be a cause of the violation.” 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(k).
Whether there is a reasonable likelihood of such violations in the future must be considered.

9

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, Exchange Act Release No. 43862, 2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *101
(Jan. 19, 2001), pet. denied, 289 F. 3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Such a showing is “significantly
less than that required for an injunction.” Id. at *114. In determining whether a cease-and-desist
order is appropriate, the Commission considers the Steadman factors quoted above, as well as the
recency of the violation, the degree of harm to investors or the marketplace, and the combination
of sanctions against the respondent. See WHX Corp. v. SEC, 362 F.3d 854, 859-61 (D.C. Cir.
2004); KPMG, 2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *116.
Ourand’s conduct was egregious and recurrent, continuing over five years. Had
Mutombo not serendipitously discovered a theft from his account, the misconduct might still be
continuing. The conduct involved a high degree of scienter. There is a lack of assurances
against future violations and recognition of the wrongful nature of the conduct. The violations
are neither recent nor remote in time. The degree of direct financial harm to clients is quantified
in the over $670,000 that Ourand misappropriated. Further, as the Commission has often
emphasized, the public interest determination extends beyond consideration of the particular
investors affected by a respondent’s conduct to the public-at-large, the welfare of investors as a
class, and standards of conduct in the securities business generally. In light of these
considerations, a cease-and-desist order is appropriate.
C. Disgorgement
Advisers Act Section 203(j) and Investment Company Act Section 9(e) authorize
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, including reasonable interest, in cease-and-desist proceedings.
Disgorgement of ill-gotten gains is “an equitable remedy designed to deprive a wrongdoer of his
unjust enrichment and to deter others from violating the securities laws.” Montford & Co. v.
SEC, 793 F.3d 76, 84 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting SEC v. First City Fin. Corp., 890 F.2d 1215,
1230 (D.C. Cir. 1989)). Ourand misappropriated a total of $671,367 from the Mutombo, Rice,
and Tyson client accounts. While he directed some of the misappropriated funds to persons
other than himself, “how a defendant chooses to spend his ill-gotten gains, whether it be for
business expenses, personal use, or otherwise, is immaterial to disgorgement.” SEC v.
Aerokinetic Energy Corp., 444 F. App’x. 382, 385 (11th Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted).
Accordingly, $671,367 of ill-gotten gains is subject to disgorgement, and disgorgement in that
amount will be ordered.
D. Civil Money Penalty
Advisers Act Section 203(i) and Investment Company Act Section 9(d) authorize the
Commission to impose civil money penalties against a person who violated, or was the cause of
the violation of, any provision of the Advisers Act, or rules thereunder, where such penalties are
in the public interest. In considering whether a penalty is in the public interest, the Commission
may consider six factors: (1) fraud or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory
requirement; (2) harm to others; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) previous violations; (5) deterrence;
and (6) such other matters as justice may require. See Section 203(i)(3) of the Advisers Act;
Section 9(d)(3) of the Investment Company Act.

10

As to Ourand, there are no mitigating factors,8 and there are several aggravating factors.
He violated the antifraud provisions, so his violative actions “involved fraud, deceit, [and]
deliberate or reckless regard of a regulatory requirement” within the meaning of Advisers Act
Section 203(i)(2)(C), (3) and Investment Company Act Section 9(d)(2)(C). Harm to others is
quantified in the more than $670,000 that Ourand misappropriated. Deterrence requires a
substantial penalty against Ourand because of the breach of the fiduciary duty owed to advisory
clients.
Penalties in addition to the other sanctions ordered are in the public interest. Pursuant to
Advisers Act Section 203(i)(2)(C) and Investment Company Act Section 9(d)(2)(C), for each
violative act or omission after March 3, 2009, and before March 6, 2013, the maximum third-tier
penalty is $150,000 for a natural person. 17 C.F.R. § 201.1004, Subpt. E, Table IV. A third-tier
penalty is appropriate because Ourand’s violative acts involved fraud and resulted in substantial
losses to other persons and substantial gains for himself. The provisions, like most civil penalty
statutes, leave the precise unit of violation undefined. See Colin S. Diver, The Assessment and
Mitigation of Civil Money Penalties by Federal Administrative Agencies, 79 Colum. L. Rev.
1435, 1440-41 (1979).
The events at issue will be considered as three courses of action – Ourand’s violative
conduct with respect to the accounts of Mutombo, Rice, and the Tysons. However, the violative
conduct with respect to Mutombo’s account ended in 2009, more than five years before the
institution of this proceeding, and thus outside the five year statute of limitations provided in 28
U.S.C. § 2462. Third-tier civil penalties totaling $300,000 – $150,000 for the violations related
to the Rice accounts and $150,000 for the violations related to the Tyson accounts – will be
ordered.
E. Bar
The Division requests an industry bar. Combined with the other sanctions ordered, a bar
is in the public interest and an appropriate deterrent. Ourand’s violation involved scienter. His
business provides him with the opportunity to commit violations of the securities laws in the
future. The record shows a lack of recognition of the wrongful nature of the violative conduct.
Ourand’s abuse of the trust placed on him as a fiduciary is particularly reprehensible.
V. RECORD CERTIFICATION
Pursuant to Rule 351(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.351(b),
it is certified that the record includes the items set forth in the record index issued by the
Secretary of the Commission on March 11, 2016.

Ourand’s lack of a disciplinary history is not mitigative and does not remove the need for
sanctions. Mitchell M. Maynard, Advisers Act Release No. 2875, 2009 SEC LEXIS 1621, at
*42 & n.39 (May 15, 2009) (“[T]he absence of disciplinary history is not mitigative as securities
professionals should not be rewarded for complying with securities laws.”).
