The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in

RESPONDENT

1.
From June 8, 2005 through September 9, 2009, including the period
during which he engaged in the conduct alleged in the criminal action described below, White
was a registered representative associated with a broker-dealer that was registered with the
Commission. During this same period, White also held himself out as an investment adviser in
connection with his 100% ownership and control of Professional Investment Advisors, Inc., a
corporation acting as an unregistered investment adviser, through which White solicited clients,
provided investment advice, and obtained compensation. White, age 58, was a resident of
Huntington, NY, during the period when he committed the crimes described below. He is
currently incarcerated at the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York.
B.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

2.
On November 2, 2012, the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office (the
“District Attorney”) indicted White in New York Supreme Court in People v. Paul White, Case

No. 2710-2012. The indictment alleged that White committed eight counts of grand larceny in
the second degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §155.40(1), and one count of scheme to
defraud in the first degree, in violation of New York Penal Law §190.65(1). Specifically, the
District Attorney accused White of soliciting clients to invest approximately $3 million in a
pooled real estate investment as well as a separate real estate investment trust by falsely telling
them that these investments were safe and liquid, and that White would not be paid a
commission from his clients’ investments. The District Attorney further accused White of: (1)
transferring at least a large portion of this money into an entity that he controlled; (2) using client
funds for his own benefit, including to acquire real estate, to make payments to certain of his
clients, and to pay himself commissions; and (3) creating false and misleading documents to
cover up his fraud.
3.
On December 5, 2014, after a two-month trial, White was convicted of
seven counts of grand larceny in the second degree and one count of scheme to defraud in the
first degree.
4.
On January 29, 2015, White was sentenced to serve seven consecutive
three-to-nine year prison terms and a concurrent one-and-one-third-to-four year prison term,
resulting in a total sentence of 21 to 63 years of incarceration. In addition, the Court ordered
White pay $2,975,000 in restitution to his victims.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems
it necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be
instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against
Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act; and
C.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against
Respondent pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule
220 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.

2

If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being
duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined
against him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true
as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the
Commission’s Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule
making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final
Commission action.
By the Commission.
