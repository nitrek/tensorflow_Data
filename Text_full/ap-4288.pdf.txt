ORDER SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On September 28, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against Respondents.
On October 14, 2016, I ordered the Division of Enforcement to supplement its service
declaration regarding Respondent Telestone Technologies Corp. Telestone Techs. Corp., Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 4254, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3877. That day, the Division provided a Westlaw
printout from the Delaware Secretary of State indicating that Telestone was a void corporation, which
I will make part of the record with the Office of the Secretary. Subsequently, my office received a
letter dated October 4, 2016, from the Corporation Trust Co., Telestone’s former registered agent,
indicating that its statutory representation services had been discontinued. On October 19, 2016, the
Division filed a declaration of service establishing that a process server delivered two copies of the
OIP to the Delaware Secretary of State on October 17, 2016. I find that Telestone was served in
accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii) on October 17, 2016. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, §
321(b); Int’l Pulp Equip. Co. v. St. Regis Kraft Co., 54 F. Supp. 745, 748-49 (D. Del. 1944)
(providing that the Delaware Secretary of State can accept service on behalf of a dissolved
corporation if there is no resident agent who can be served). Accordingly, Telestone’s answer to the
OIP is due October 27, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b).
All Respondents in this proceeding have been served. I ORDER that a telephonic prehearing
conference shall be held on November 9, 2016, at 3:00 p.m. EST. Any Respondent that fails to
timely file an answer, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding will be
deemed in default and the registration of its securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
