ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On April 14, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled to commence on May 9, 2016.
On April 19, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service establishing
that Respondents were served with the OIP by April 18, 2016, in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Because service was made by mail, Respondents’ answers to the OIP are
due by May 2, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). If Respondents fail to
timely file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding, they will be deemed in default, the
proceeding will be determined against them, and the registrations of their securities will be
revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
I ORDER that the May 9, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED, and that a telephonic
prehearing conference shall be held on June 10, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, if the proceeding has
not been resolved by then.
