On July 11, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting

Respondent has a class of securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings. I previously found that Respondent was served with the OIP on July 15 and its
answer was due August 8, 2016. Breitling Energy Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.

revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding. Id.
On August 19, 2016, Respondent filed its response to the show cause order. In it,
Respondent explained why it has been unable to meet its periodic filing obligations. Respondent

file an answer, and that a hearing be scheduled. In light of Respondent’s response, the order to
show cause is DISCHARGED and Respondent will not be defaulted at this time.

statement, which addresses each numbered item in Rule 221(c), and includes proposed due dates
where applicable.1 The filing should include a proposed hearing date. See 17 C.F.R. §
