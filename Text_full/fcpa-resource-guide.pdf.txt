U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT
By the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and

FOREWORD
We are pleased to announce the publication of A Resource Guide to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a critically important statute for combating corruption around the globe. Corruption has
corrosive effects on democratic institutions, undermining public accountability and diverting public resources from important priorities such as health, education, and infrastructure. When business is won or lost based on how much a company is
willing to pay in bribes rather than on the quality of its products and services, law-abiding companies are placed at a competitive disadvantage—and consumers lose. For these and other reasons, enforcing the FCPA is a continuing priority at the
Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The Guide is the product of extensive efforts by experts at DOJ and SEC, and has benefited from valuable input from
the Departments of Commerce and State.  It endeavors to provide helpful information to enterprises of all shapes and sizes—
from small businesses doing their first transactions abroad to multi-national corporations with subsidiaries around the world. 
The Guide addresses a wide variety of topics, including who and what is covered by the FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting
provisions; the definition of a “foreign official”; what constitute proper and improper gifts, travel and entertainment expenses;
the nature of facilitating payments; how successor liability applies in the mergers and acquisitions context; the hallmarks of
an effective corporate compliance program; and the different types of civil and criminal resolutions available in the FCPA
context. On these and other topics, the Guide takes a multi-faceted approach, setting forth in detail the statutory requirements while also providing insight into DOJ and SEC enforcement practices through hypotheticals, examples of enforcement actions and anonymized declinations, and summaries of applicable case law and DOJ opinion releases.
The Guide is an unprecedented undertaking by DOJ and SEC to provide the public with detailed information about
our FCPA enforcement approach and priorities. We are proud of the many lawyers and staff who worked on this project,
and hope that it will be a useful reference for companies, individuals, and others interested in our enforcement of the Act.

Corporate bribery is bad business. In our free market system it is basic that the
sale of products should take place on the basis of price, quality, and service.
Corporate bribery is fundamentally destructive of this basic tenet. Corporate
bribery of foreign officials takes place primarily to assist corporations in gaining
business. Thus foreign corporate bribery affects the very stability of overseas
business. Foreign corporate bribes also affect our domestic competitive climate
when domestic firms engage in such practices as a substitute for healthy competition for foreign business.1
—United States Senate, 1977

chapter 1

Introduction

INTRODUCTION
Congress enacted the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA or the Act) in
1977 in response to revelations of widespread bribery of foreign officials by U.S.
companies. The Act was intended to halt those corrupt practices, create a level
playing field for honest businesses, and restore public confidence in the integrity of the marketplace.2

The FCPA contains both anti-bribery and accounting

enforcement authority and are committed to fighting for-

provisions. The anti-bribery provisions prohibit U.S. per-

Corruption is also bad for business. Corruption is
anti-competitive, leading to distorted prices and disadvantaging honest businesses that do not pay bribes. It increases
the cost of doing business globally and inflates the cost of

The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions

THE FCPA: ANTI-BRIBERY
PROVISIONS
The FCPA addresses the problem of international corruption in two ways: (1)
the anti-bribery provisions, which are discussed below, prohibit individuals
and businesses from bribing foreign government officials in order to obtain
or retain business and (2) the accounting provisions, which are discussed in
Chapter 3, impose certain record keeping and internal control requirements
on issuers, and prohibit individuals and companies from knowingly falsifying
an issuer’s books and records or circumventing or failing to implement an issuer’s system of internal controls. Violations of the FCPA can lead to civil and
criminal penalties, sanctions, and remedies, including fines, disgorgement,
and/or imprisonment.
In general, the FCPA prohibits offering to pay, pay-

their officers, directors, employees, agents, and sharehold-

ing, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money

ers; (2) “domestic concerns” and their officers, directors,

or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influ-

employees, agents, and shareholders; and (3) certain per-

Hypothetical: FCPA Jurisdiction
Company A, a Delaware company with its principal place of business in New York, is a large energy company that
operates globally, including in a number of countries that have a high risk of corruption, such as Foreign Country. Company
A’s shares are listed on a national U.S. stock exchange. Company A enters into an agreement with a European company
(EuroCo) to submit a joint bid to the Oil Ministry to build a refinery in Foreign Country. EuroCo is not an issuer.
Executives of Company A and EuroCo meet in New York to discuss how to win the bid and decide to hire a purported
third-party consultant (Intermediary) and have him use part of his “commission” to bribe high-ranking officials within the
Oil Ministry. Intermediary meets with executives at Company A and EuroCo in New York to finalize the scheme. Eventually,
millions of dollars in bribes are funneled from the United States and Europe through Intermediary to high-ranking officials
at the Oil Ministry, and Company A and EuroCo win the contract. A few years later, a front page article alleging that the
contract was procured through bribery appears in Foreign Country, and DOJ and SEC begin investigating whether the
FCPA was violated. 
Based on these facts, which entities fall within the FCPA’s jurisdiction?
All of the entities easily fall within the FCPA’s jurisdiction. Company A is both an “issuer” and a “domestic concern”
under the FCPA, and Intermediary is an “agent” of Company A. EuroCo and Intermediary are also subject to the FCPA’s
territorial jurisdiction provision based on their conduct while in the United States. Moreover, even if EuroCo and Intermediary
had never taken any actions in the territory of the United States, they can still be subject to jurisdiction under a traditional
application of conspiracy law and may be subject to substantive FCPA charges under Pinkerton liability, namely, being liable
for the reasonably foreseeable substantive FCPA crimes committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy.

held that payments to obtain favorable tax treatment can,
under appropriate circumstances, violate the FCPA:

Examples of Actions Taken
to Obtain or Retain Business

Avoiding or lowering taxes reduces operating costs
and thus increases profit margins, thereby freeing up
funds that the business is otherwise legally obligated
to expend. And this, in turn, enables it to take any
number of actions to the disadvantage of competitors. Bribing foreign officials to lower taxes and customs duties certainly can provide an unfair advantage
over competitors and thereby be of assistance to the
payor in obtaining or retaining business.

	Influencing the procurement process

[W]e hold that Congress intended for the FCPA
to apply broadly to payments intended to assist the
payor, either directly or indirectly, in obtaining or
retaining business for some person, and that bribes
paid to foreign tax officials to secure illegally reduced
customs and tax liability constitute a type of payment
that can fall within this broad coverage.72

	Influencing the adjudication of lawsuits or
enforcement actions
	Obtaining exceptions to regulations
	Avoiding contract termination

made to secure favorable tax treatment, to reduce or eliminate customs duties, to obtain government action to prevent competitors from entering a market, or to circumvent
a licensing or permit requirement, all satisfy the business

court explained that in enacting the FCPA, “Congress meant
to prohibit a range of payments wider than only those that
directly influence the acquisition or retention of government contracts or similar commercial or industrial arrangements.”70 The Kay court found that “[t]he congressional
target was bribery paid to engender assistance in improving
the business opportunities of the payor or his beneficiary,
irrespective of whether that assistance be direct or indirect,
and irrespective of whether it be related to administering
the law, awarding, extending, or renewing a contract, or

which fell within the FCPA’s prohibition on corrupt
payments made for the purpose of “retaining” business.
The seven companies paid a total of more than $235

In enacting the FCPA, Congress recognized that bribes

Company A is a large U.S. engineering company with global operations in more than 50 countries, including a
number that have a high risk of corruption, such as Foreign Country. Company A’s stock is listed on a national U.S. stock
exchange. In conducting its business internationally, Company A’s officers and employees come into regular contact with
foreign officials, including officials in various ministries and state-owned entities. At a trade show, Company A has a booth
at which it offers free pens, hats, t-shirts, and other similar promotional items with Company A’s logo. Company A also
serves free coffee, other beverages, and snacks at the booth. Some of the visitors to the booth are foreign officials.
Is Company A in violation of the FCPA?
No.  These are legitimate, bona fide expenditures made in connection with the promotion, demonstration, or
explanation of Company A’s products or services There is nothing to suggest corrupt intent here The FCPA does not
prevent companies from promoting their businesses in this way or providing legitimate hospitality, including to foreign
officials Providing promotional items with company logos or free snacks as set forth above is an appropriate means of
providing hospitality and promoting business Such conduct has never formed the basis for an FCPA enforcement action
At the trade show, Company A invites a dozen current and prospective customers out for drinks, and pays
the moderate bar tab. Some of the current and prospective customers are foreign officials under the FCPA.  Is
Company A in violation of the FCPA?
No. Again, the FCPA was not designed to prohibit all forms of hospitality to foreign officials. While the cost here may
be more substantial than the beverages, snacks, and promotional items provided at the booth, and the invitees specifically
selected, there is still nothing to suggest corrupt intent.
Two years ago, Company A won a long-term contract to supply goods and services to the state-owned Electricity
Commission in Foreign Country. The Electricity Commission is 100% owned, controlled, and operated by the
government of Foreign Country, and employees of the Electricity Commission are subject to Foreign Country’s
domestic bribery laws. Some Company A executives are in Foreign Country for meetings with officials of the
Electricity Commission. The General Manager of the Electricity Commission was recently married, and during the
trip Company A executives present a moderately priced crystal vase to the General Manager as a wedding gift
and token of esteem. Is Company A in violation of the FCPA?
No. It is appropriate to provide reasonable gifts to foreign officials as tokens of esteem or gratitude. It is important that
such gifts be made openly and transparently, properly recorded in a company’s books and records, and given only where
appropriate under local law, customary where given, and reasonable for the occasion.
During the course of the contract described above, Company A periodically provides training to Electricity
Commission employees at its facilities in Michigan. The training is paid for by the Electricity Commission as part of
the contract.  Senior officials of the Electricity Commission inform Company A that they want to inspect the facilities
and ensure that the training is working well. Company A pays for the airfare, hotel, and transportation for the

appropriate inspection. Company A executives take the officials to a moderately priced dinner, a baseball game,
and a play. Do any of these actions violate the FCPA?
No Neither the costs associated with training the employees nor the trip for the senior officials to the Company’s
facilities in order to inspect them violates the FCPA  Reasonable and bona fide promotional expenditures do not violate
the FCPA  Here, Company A is providing training to the Electricity Commission’s employees and is hosting the Electricity
Commission senior officials Their review of the execution and performance of the contract is a legitimate business purpose
Even the provision of business class airfare is reasonable under the circumstances, as are the meals and entertainment,
which are only a small component of the business trip
Would this analysis be different if Company A instead paid for the senior officials to travel first-class with their
spouses for an all-expenses-paid, week-long trip to Las Vegas, where Company A has no facilities?
Yes. This conduct almost certainly violates the FCPA because it evinces a corrupt intent. Here, the trip does not appear
to be designed for any legitimate business purpose, is extravagant, includes expenses for the officials’ spouses, and therefore
appears to be designed to corruptly curry favor with the foreign government officials. Moreover, if the trip were booked as a
legitimate business expense—such as the provision of training at its facilities—Company A would also be in violation of the
FCPA’s accounting provisions. Furthermore, this conduct suggests deficiencies in Company A’s internal controls.
Company A’s contract with the Electricity Commission is going to expire, and the Electricity Commission is
offering the next contract through its tender process. An employee of the Electricity Commission contacts
Company A and offers to provide Company A with confidential, non-public bid information from Company A’s
competitors if Company A will pay for a vacation to Paris for him and his girlfriend. Employees of Company A
accede to the official’s request, pay for the vacation, receive the confidential bid information, and yet still do not
win the contract. Has Company A violated the FCPA?
Yes Company A has provided things of value to a foreign official for the purpose of inducing the official to misuse
his office and to gain an improper advantage It does not matter that it was the foreign official who first suggested the
illegal conduct or that Company A ultimately was not successful in winning the contract  This conduct would also violate
the FCPA’s accounting provisions if the trip were booked as a legitimate business expense and suggests deficiencies in
Company A’s internal controls

in bribes to officials of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil to secure
sales of a fuel additive. Both the company and the Canadian
national pleaded guilty to criminal charges and resolved
civil enforcement actions by SEC. 134
In another case, the U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight
forwarding company was charged with paying bribes on
behalf of its customers in several countries.135 Although the
U.S. subsidiary was not an issuer under the FCPA, it was an
“agent” of several U.S. issuers and was thus charged directly
with violating the FCPA. Charges against the freight forwarding company and seven of its customers resulted in
over $236.5 million in sanctions.136
Because Congress anticipated the use of third-party
agents in bribery schemes—for example, to avoid actual
knowledge of a bribe—it defined the term “knowing” in a
way that prevents individuals and businesses from avoiding
liability by putting “any person” between themselves and

officials could not take refuge from the Act’s prohibitions by their unwarranted obliviousness to any
action (or inaction), language or other “signaling device” that should reasonably alert them of the “high
probability” of an FCPA violation.140

Common red flags associated with third parties include:
•	 excessive commissions to third-party agents or
consultants;
•	 unreasonably large discounts to third-party
distributors;
•	 third-party “consulting agreements” that include
only vaguely described services;
•	 the third-party consultant is in a different line of
business than that for which it has been engaged;
•	 the third party is related to or closely associated
with the foreign official;
22

•	 the third party became part of the transaction at
the express request or insistence of the foreign
official;
•	 the third party is merely a shell company incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction; and
•	 the third party requests payment to offshore
bank accounts.

What Affirmative Defenses Are
Available?
The FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions contain two affirmative defenses: (1) that the payment was lawful under the
written laws of the foreign country (the “local law” defense),
and (2) that the money was spent as part of demonstrating a
product or performing a contractual obligation (the “reason-

The Local Law Defense

For the local law defense to apply, a defendant must
United States v. Kozeny, et al.
In December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit upheld a conscious avoidance
instruction given during the 2009 trial of a businessman
who was convicted of conspiring to violate the FCPA’s
anti-bribery provisions by agreeing to make payments to
Azeri officials in a scheme to encourage the privatization
of the Azerbaijan Republic’s state oil company. The
court of appeals found that the instruction did not lack
a factual predicate, citing evidence and testimony at
trial demonstrating that the defendant knew corruption
was pervasive in Azerbaijan; that he was aware of his
business partner’s reputation for misconduct; that he
had created two U.S. companies in order to shield
himself and other investors from potential liability for
payments made in violation of the FCPA; and that the
defendant expressed concerns during a conference call
about whether his business partner and company were
bribing officials.
The court of appeals also rejected the defendant’s
contention that the conscious avoidance charge had
improperly permitted the jury to convict him based on
negligence, explaining that ample evidence in the record
showed that the defendant had “serious concerns”
about the legality of his partner’s business practices
“and worked to avoid learning exactly what [he] was
doing,” and noting that the district court had specifically
instructed the jury not to convict based on negligence.

establish that “the payment, gift, offer, or promise of anything of value that was made, was lawful under the written laws and regulations of the foreign official’s, political
party’s, party official’s, or candidate’s country.”141 The defendant must establish that the payment was lawful under the
foreign country’s written laws and regulations at the time
of the offense. In creating the local law defense in 1988,
Congress sought “to make clear that the absence of written
laws in a foreign official’s country would not by itself be sufficient to satisfy this defense.”142 Thus, the fact that bribes
may not be prosecuted under local law is insufficient to
establish the defense. In practice, the local law defense arises
infrequently, as the written laws and regulations of countries rarely, if ever, permit corrupt payments. Nevertheless,
if a defendant can establish that conduct that otherwise
falls within the scope of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions
was lawful under written, local law, he or she would have a
defense to prosecution.
In United States v. Kozeny, the defendant unsuccessfully sought to assert the local law defense regarding the law
of Azerbaijan. The parties disputed the contents and applicability of Azeri law, and each presented expert reports and
testimony on behalf of their conflicting interpretations. The
court ruled that the defendant could not invoke the FCPA’s
affirmative defense because Azeri law did not actually legalize the bribe payment. The court concluded that an exception under Azeri law relieving bribe payors who voluntarily

23

disclose bribe payments to the authorities of criminal liability did not make the bribes legal.143

In addition, DOJ has frequently provided guidance about
legitimate promotional and contract-related expenses—
addressing travel and lodging expenses in particular—
through several opinion procedure releases. Under the circumstances presented in those releases,

146

DOJ opined that

the following types of expenditures on behalf of foreign
officials did not warrant FCPA enforcement action:
•	 travel and expenses to visit company facilities or
operations;
•	 travel and expenses for training; and
•	 product demonstration or promotional activities,
including travel and expenses for meetings.

•	 Do not condition payment of expenses on any
action by the foreign official.154
•	 Obtain written confirmation that payment of the
expenses is not contrary to local law.155
•	 Provide no additional compensation, stipends, or
spending money beyond what is necessary to pay
for actual expenses incurred.156
•	 Ensure that costs and expenses on behalf of the
foreign officials will be accurately recorded in the

What Are Facilitating or Expediting
Payments?
The FCPA’s bribery prohibition contains a narrow
exception for “facilitating or expediting payments” made in
furtherance of routine governmental action.159 The facilitating payments exception applies only when a payment is
made to further “routine governmental action” that involves
non-discretionary acts.160 Examples of “routine governmental action” include processing visas, providing police protection or mail service, and supplying utilities like phone
service, power, and water. Routine government action does
not include a decision to award new business or to continue
business with a particular party.161 Nor does it include acts
that are within an official’s discretion or that would constitute misuse of an official’s office.162 Thus, paying an official a
small amount to have the power turned on at a factory might
be a facilitating payment; paying an inspector to ignore the
fact that the company does not have a valid permit to operate
the factory would not be a facilitating payment.

Whether a payment falls within the exception is not
dependent on the size of the payment, though size can be
telling, as a large payment is more suggestive of corrupt
intent to influence a non-routine governmental action. But,
like the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions more generally, the
facilitating payments exception focuses on the purpose of the
payment rather than its value. For instance, an Oklahomabased corporation violated the FCPA when its subsidiary
paid Argentine customs officials approximately $166,000
to secure customs clearance for equipment and materials
that lacked required certifications or could not be imported
under local law and to pay a lower-than-applicable duty
rate. The company’s Venezuelan subsidiary had also paid
Venezuelan customs officials approximately $7,000 to permit
the importation and exportation of equipment and materials
not in compliance with local regulations and to avoid a full
inspection of the imported goods.163 In another case, three
subsidiaries of a global supplier of oil drilling products and
services were criminally charged with authorizing an agent to
make at least 378 corrupt payments (totaling approximately
$2.1 million) to Nigerian Customs Service officials for pref-

Although true facilitating payments are not illegal under the FCPA, they may still violate local law in the
countries where the company is operating, and the OECD’s
Working Group on Bribery recommends that all countries
encourage companies to prohibit or discourage facilitating
payments, which the United States has done regularly.166
In addition, other countries’ foreign bribery laws, such as
the United Kingdom’s, may not contain an exception for
facilitating payments.167 Individuals and companies should
therefore be aware that although true facilitating payments

25

are permissible under the FCPA, they may still subject a
company or individual to sanctions. As with any expenditure,
facilitating payments may still violate the FCPA if they are
not properly recorded in an issuer’s books and records.

chapter 2

The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions

Hypothetical: Facilitating Payments
Company A is a large multi-national mining company with operations in Foreign Country, where it recently identified
a significant new ore deposit It has ready buyers for the new ore but has limited capacity to get it to market In order to
increase the size and speed of its ore export, Company A will need to build a new road from its facility to the port that can
accommodate larger trucks Company A retains an agent in Foreign Country to assist it in obtaining the required permits,
including an environmental permit, to build the road The agent informs Company A’s vice president for international
operations that he plans to make a one-time small cash payment to a clerk in the relevant government office to ensure
that the clerk files and stamps the permit applications expeditiously, as the agent has experienced delays of three months
when he has not made this “grease” payment The clerk has no discretion about whether to file and stamp the permit
applications once the requisite filing fee has been paid The vice president authorizes the payment
A few months later, the agent tells the vice president that he has run into a problem obtaining a necessary environmental
permit. It turns out that the planned road construction would adversely impact an environmentally sensitive and protected
local wetland. While the problem could be overcome by rerouting the road, such rerouting would cost Company A $1
million more and would slow down construction by six months.  It would also increase the transit time for the ore and
reduce the number of monthly shipments. The agent tells the vice president that he is good friends with the director of
Foreign Country’s Department of Natural Resources and that it would only take a modest cash payment to the director
and the “problem would go away.” The vice president authorizes the payment, and the agent makes it. After receiving the
payment, the director issues the permit, and Company A constructs its new road through the wetlands.
Was the payment to the clerk a violation of the FCPA?
No. Under these circumstances, the payment to the clerk would qualify as a facilitating payment, since it is a one-time,
small payment to obtain a routine, non-discretionary governmental service that Company A is entitled to receive (i.e., the
stamping and filing of the permit application). However, while the payment may qualify as an exception to the FCPA’s
anti-bribery provisions, it may violate other laws, both in Foreign Country and elsewhere. In addition, if the payment is not
accurately recorded, it could violate the FCPA’s books and records provision.
Was the payment to the director a violation of the FCPA?
Yes. The payment to the director of the Department of Natural Resources was in clear violation of the FCPA, since it
was designed to corruptly influence a foreign official into improperly approving a permit. The issuance of the environmental
permit was a discretionary act, and indeed, Company A should not have received it. Company A, its vice president, and the
local agent may all be prosecuted for authorizing and paying the bribe.

Practical Tips to Reduce FCPA Risk in Mergers and Acquisitions
Companies pursuing mergers or acquisitions can take certain steps to identify and potentially reduce FCPA risks:
	 M&A Opinion Procedure Release Requests: One option is to seek an opinion from DOJ in anticipation of a
potential acquisition, such as occurred with Opinion Release 08-02 That case involved special circumstances,
namely, severely limited pre-acquisition due diligence available to the potential acquiring company, and, because
it was an opinion release (i e , providing certain assurances by DOJ concerning prospective conduct), it necessarily
imposed demanding standards and prescriptive timeframes in return for specific assurances from DOJ, which
SEC, as a matter of discretion, also honors Thus, obtaining an opinion from DOJ can be a good way to address
specific due diligence challenges, but, because of the nature of such an opinion, it will likely contain more stringent
requirements than may be necessary in all circumstances
	 M&A Risk-Based FCPA Due Diligence and Disclosure: As a practical matter, most acquisitions will typically not
require the type of prospective assurances contained in an opinion from DOJ DOJ and SEC encourage companies
engaging in mergers and acquisitions to: (1) conduct thorough risk-based FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence
on potential new business acquisitions; (2) ensure that the acquiring company’s code of conduct and compliance
policies and procedures regarding the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to
newly acquired businesses or merged entities; (3) train the directors, officers, and employees of newly acquired
businesses or merged entities, and when appropriate, train agents and business partners, on the FCPA and other
relevant anti-corruption laws and the company’s code of conduct and compliance policies and procedures; (4)
conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or merged businesses as quickly as practicable; and (5) disclose
any corrupt payments discovered as part of its due diligence of newly acquired entities or merged entities DOJ
and SEC will give meaningful credit to companies who undertake these actions, and, in appropriate circumstances,

Later, four executives from the predecessor company

The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions

were convicted of FCPA violations, three of whom received
terms of imprisonment.193
On occasion, when an enforcement action has
been taken against a predecessor company, the successor seeks assurances that it will not be subject to a future
enforcement action. In one such case, a Dutch predecessor resolved FCPA charges with DOJ through a deferred
prosecution agreement.194 While both the predecessor
and successor signed the agreement, which included a
commitment to ongoing cooperation and an improved
compliance program, only the predecessor company was
charged; in signing the agreement, the successor company
gained the certainty of conditional release from criminal
liability, even though it was not being pursued for FCPA
violations.195 In another case, after a Connecticut-based
company uncovered FCPA violations by a California
company it sought to acquire, both companies voluntarily
disclosed the conduct to DOJ and SEC.196 The predecessor company resolved its criminal liability through a
non-prosecution agreement with DOJ that included an
$800,000 monetary penalty and also settled with SEC,
paying a total of $1.1 million in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and civil penalties. The successor company
proceeded with the acquisition and separately entered
into a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ in which it
agreed, among other things, to ensure full performance of
the predecessor company’s non-prosecution agreement.
This agreement provided certainty to the successor concerning its FCPA liability. 197
Importantly, a successor company’s voluntary disclosure, appropriate due diligence, and implementation of an
effective compliance program may also decrease the likelihood of an enforcement action regarding an acquired company’s post-acquisition conduct when pre-acquisition due
diligence is not possible.198

Hypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Not Previously
Subject to the FCPA
Company A is a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in the United States and whose shares are listed on
a national U.S. exchange. Company A is considering acquiring Foreign Company, which is not an issuer or a domestic
concern. Foreign Company takes no actions within the United States that would make it subject to territorial jurisdiction.
Company A’s proposed acquisition would make Foreign Company a subsidiary of Company A.
Scenario 1:
Prior to acquiring Foreign Company, Company A engages in extensive due diligence of Foreign Company, including: (1)
having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Foreign Company’s sales and financial data, its customer
contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based analysis of Foreign Company’s customer
base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Foreign Company; and (4) engaging in discussions
with Foreign Company’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding all corruption risks,
compliance efforts, and any other corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Foreign Company over the past ten years.
This due diligence aims to determine whether Foreign Company has appropriate anti-corruption and compliance policies
in place, whether Foreign Company’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies, how Foreign
Company ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.
During the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Foreign Company has made several potentially
improper payments in the form of an inflated commission to a third-party agent in connection with a government contract
with Foreign Country. Immediately after the acquisition, Company A discloses the conduct to DOJ and SEC, suspends
and terminates those employees and the third-party agent responsible for the payments, and makes certain that the
illegal payments have stopped. It also quickly integrates Foreign Company into Company A’s own robust internal controls,
including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online
and in-person training in the local language. Company A also requires Foreign Company’s third-party distributors and other
agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anticorruption representations and warranties and audit rights.
Based on these facts, could DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?
No. Although DOJ and SEC have jurisdiction over Company A because it is an issuer, neither could pursue Company
A for conduct that occurred prior to its acquisition of Foreign Company. As Foreign Company was neither an issuer nor a
domestic concern and was not subject to U.S. territorial jurisdiction, DOJ and SEC have no jurisdiction over its pre-acquisition
misconduct. The acquisition of a company does not create jurisdiction where none existed before.
Importantly, Company A’s extensive pre-acquisition due diligence allowed it to identify and halt the corruption. As
there was no continuing misconduct post-acquisition, the FCPA was not violated.
Scenario 2:
Company A performs only minimal and pro forma pre-acquisition due diligence. It does not conduct a risk-based
analysis, and its review of Foreign Company’s data, contracts, and third-party and distributor agreements is cursory.
Company A acquires Foreign Company and makes it a wholly owned subsidiary. Although Company A circulates its
compliance policies to all new personnel after the acquisition, it does not translate the compliance policies into the local
language or train its new personnel or third-party agents on anti-corruption issues.
A few months after the acquisition, an employee in Company A’s international sales office (Sales Employee) learns
from a legacy Foreign Company employee that for years the government contract that generated most of Foreign
Company’s revenues depended on inflated commissions to a third-party agent “to make the right person happy at Foreign
Government Agency.” Sales Employee is told that unless the payments continue the business will likely be lost, which
would mean that Company A’s new acquisition would quickly become a financial failure. The payments continue for two
(cont’d)

31

chapter 2

The FCPA:
Anti-Bribery Provisions

years after the acquisition. After another employee of Company A reports the long-running bribe scheme to a director at
Foreign Government Agency, Company A stops the payments and DOJ and SEC investigate.
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC charge Company A?
Yes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Any charges would not,
however, be premised upon successor liability, but rather on Company A’s post-acquisition bribe payments, which
themselves created criminal and civil liability for Company A.
Scenario 3:
Under local law, Company A’s ability to conduct pre-acquisition due diligence on Foreign Company is limited. In the
due diligence it does conduct, Company A determines that Foreign Company is doing business in high-risk countries
and in high-risk industries but finds no red flags specific to Foreign Company’s operations. Post-acquisition, Company
A conducts extensive due diligence and determines that Foreign Company had paid bribes to officials with Foreign
Government Agency. Company A takes prompt action to remediate the problem, including following the measures set
forth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02. Among other actions, it voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and
SEC, ensures all bribes are immediately stopped, takes remedial action against all parties involved in the corruption, and
quickly incorporates Foreign Company into a robust compliance program and Company A’s other internal controls.
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?
DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances Companies can follow
the measures set forth in Opinion Procedure Release No 08-02, or seek their own opinions, where adequate pre-acquisition
due diligence is not possible

Hypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Already Subject to
the FCPA
Both Company A and Company B are Delaware corporations with their principal offices in the United States Both
companies’ shares are listed on a national U S exchange
Scenario 1:
Company A is considering acquiring several of Company B’s business lines. Prior to the acquisition, Company A engages
in extensive due diligence, including: (1) having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Company B’s
sales and financial data, its customer contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based
analysis of Company B’s customer base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Company B; and
(4) engaging in discussions with Company B’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding
all corruption risks, compliance efforts, and any other major corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Company B
over the past ten years. This due diligence aims to determine whether Company B has appropriate anti-corruption and
compliance policies in place, whether Company B’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies,
how Company B ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.
During the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Company B has made several potentially improper
payments in connection with a government contract with Foreign Country. As a condition of the acquisition, Company A
requires Company B to disclose the misconduct to the government. Company A makes certain that the illegal payments
(cont’d)

32

have stopped and quickly integrates Company B’s business lines into Company A’s own robust internal controls, including
its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online and inperson training in the local language. Company A also requires Company B’s third-party distributors and other agents to
sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti-corruption
representations and warranties and audit rights.
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?
DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. DOJ and SEC
encourage companies like Company A to conduct extensive FCPA due diligence. By uncovering the corruption, Company
A put itself in a favorable position, and, because the corrupt payments have stopped, Company A has no continuing
liability. Whether DOJ and SEC might charge Company B depends on facts and circumstances beyond the scope of this
hypothetical. DOJ would consider its Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and SEC would consider
the factors contained in the Seaboard Report, both of which are discussed in Chapter 5. In general, the more egregious
and long-standing the corruption, the more likely it is that DOJ and SEC would prosecute Company B. In certain limited
circumstances, DOJ and SEC have in the past declined to bring charges against acquired companies, recognizing that
acquiring companies may bear much of the reputational damage and costs associated with such charges.
Scenario 2:
Company A plans to acquire Company B Although, as in Scenario 1, Company A conducts extensive due diligence, it
does not uncover the bribery until after the acquisition Company A then makes certain that the illegal payments stop and
voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and SEC It quickly integrates Company B into Company A’s own robust internal
controls, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required
online and in-person training in the local language Company A also requires Company B’s third-party distributors and other
agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anticorruption representations and warranties and audit rights
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?
Absent unusual circumstances not contemplated by this hypothetical, DOJ and SEC are unlikely to prosecute
Company A for the pre-acquisition misconduct of Company B, provided that Company B still exists in a form that would
allow it to be prosecuted separately (e.g., Company B is a subsidiary of Company A). DOJ and SEC understand that no
due diligence is perfect and that society benefits when companies with strong compliance programs acquire and improve
companies with weak ones. At the same time, however, neither the liability for corruption—nor the harms caused by it—
are eliminated when one company acquires another. Whether DOJ and SEC will pursue a case against Company B (or, in
unusual circumstances, Company A) will depend on consideration of all the factors in the Principles of Federal Prosecution
of Business Organizations and the Seaboard Report, respectively.
Scenario 3:
Company A merges with Company B, which is in the same line of business and interacts with the same Foreign
Government customers, and forms Company C Due diligence before the merger reveals that both Company A and
Company B have been engaging in similar bribery In both cases, the bribery was extensive and known by high-level
management within the companies
Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?
Yes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company C on the basis of successor liability. Company C is a
combination of two companies that both violated the FCPA, and their merger does not eliminate their liability. In addition,
since Company C is an ongoing concern, DOJ and SEC may impose a monitorship to ensure that the bribery has ceased
and a compliance program is developed to prevent future misconduct.

The FCPA:

Under federal law, individuals or companies that aid

of the conspiracy occurred during the limitations period,
thus enabling the government to prosecute bribes paid or
accounting violations occurring more than five years prior
to the filing of formal charges.208
There are at least two ways in which the applicable
limitations period is commonly extended. First, companies or individuals cooperating with DOJ may enter into
a tolling agreement that voluntarily extends the limitations
period. Second, under 18 U.S.C. § 3292, the government
may seek a court order suspending the statute of limitations
posed in a criminal case for up to three years in order to
obtain evidence from foreign countries. Generally, the suspension period begins when the official request is made by
the U.S. government to the foreign authority and ends on
the date on which the foreign authority takes final action
on the request.209
Statute of Limitations in Civil Actions

In civil cases brought by SEC, the statute of limitations is set by 28 U.S.C. § 2462, which provides for a fiveyear limitation on any “suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.” The five-year
period begins to run “when the claim first accrued.” The
five-year limitations period applies to SEC actions seeking civil penalties, but it does not prevent SEC from
seeking equitable remedies, such as an injunction or the
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, for conduct pre-dating
the five-year period. In cases against individuals who are
not residents of the United States, the statute is tolled for
any period when the defendants are not “found within the
United States in order that proper service may be made
thereon.”210 Furthermore, companies or individuals cooperating with SEC may enter into tolling agreements that
voluntarily extend the limitations period.

The FCPA:
Accounting Provisions

THE FCPA: ACCOUNTING
PROVISIONS
In addition to the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA contains accounting provisions applicable to public companies. The FCPA’s accounting provisions operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions211 and prohibit off-the-books
accounting. Company management and investors rely on a company’s financial
statements and internal accounting controls to ensure transparency in the financial health of the business, the risks undertaken, and the transactions between
the company and its customers and business partners. The accounting provisions are designed to “strengthen the accuracy of the corporate books and
records and the reliability of the audit process which constitute the foundations
of our system of corporate disclosure.”212

The accounting provisions consist of two primary
components. First, under the “books and records” pro-

sions or consulting fees.
In instances where all the elements of a violation of
the anti-bribery provisions are not met—where, for example, there was no use of interstate commerce—companies
nonetheless may be liable if the improper payments are inaccurately recorded. Consistent with the FCPA’s approach
to prohibiting payments of any value that are made with a
corrupt purpose, there is no materiality threshold under the
books and records provision. In combination with the internal controls provision, the requirement that issuers maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the

annual financial statements that have been prepared in
conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles are
among the most comprehensive in the world. U.S. GAAP

Certification and Reporting Violations
Certain other licensing, certification, and reporting
requirements imposed by the U.S. government can also be
implicated in the foreign bribery context. For example, as
a condition of its facilitation of direct loans and loan guarantees to a foreign purchaser of U.S. goods and services,
the Export-Import Bank of the United States requires the
U.S. supplier to make certifications concerning commissions, fees, or other payments paid in connection with the
financial assistance and that it has not and will not violate
the FCPA.283 A false certification may give rise to criminal
liability for false statements.284
Similarly, manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of
certain defense articles and services are subject to registration, licensing, and reporting requirements under the

as well. For at the end of the day, the most effective
way to communicate that “doing the right thing” is a
priority, is to reward it. Conversely, if employees are
led to believe that, when it comes to compensation
and career advancement, all that counts is short-term
profitability, and that cutting ethical corners is an acceptable way of getting there, they’ll perform to that
measure. To cite an example from a different walk
of life: a college football coach can be told that the
graduation rates of his players are what matters, but
he’ll know differently if the sole focus of his contract

First, as part of risk-based due diligence, companies
should understand the qualifications and associations of
its third-party partners, including its business reputation,
and relationship, if any, with foreign officials. The degree of
scrutiny should increase as red flags surface.
Second, companies should have an understanding of
the business rationale for including the third party in the
transaction. Among other things, the company should
understand the role of and need for the third party and
ensure that the contract terms specifically describe the services to be performed. Additional considerations include

Compliance Program Case Study
Recent DOJ and SEC actions relating to a financial institution’s real estate transactions with a government agency
in China illustrate the benefits of implementing and enforcing a comprehensive risk-based compliance program. The
case involved a joint venture real estate investment in the Luwan District of Shanghai, China, between a U.S.-based
financial institution and a state-owned entity that functioned as the District’s real estate arm. The government entity
conducted the transactions through two special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”), with the second SPV purchasing a 12%
stake in a real estate project.
The financial institution, through a robust compliance program, frequently trained its employees, imposed a
comprehensive payment-approval process designed to prevent bribery, and staffed a compliance department with
a direct reporting line to the board of directors. As appropriate given the industry, market, and size and structure of
the transactions, the financial institution (1) provided extensive FCPA training to the senior executive responsible for
the transactions and (2) conducted extensive due diligence on the transactions, the local government entity, and the
SPVs. Due diligence on the entity included reviewing Chinese government records; speaking with sources familiar
with the Shanghai real estate market; checking the government entity’s payment records and credit references;
conducting an on-site visit and placing a pretextual telephone call to the entity’s offices; searching media sources;
and conducting background checks on the entity’s principals. The financial institution vetted the SPVs by obtaining
a letter with designated bank account information from a Chinese official associated with the government entity (the
“Chinese Official”); using an international law firm to request and review 50 documents from the SPVs’ Canadian
attorney; interviewing the attorney; and interviewing the SPVs’ management.
Notwithstanding the financial institution’s robust compliance program and good faith enforcement of it, the
company failed to learn that the Chinese Official personally owned nearly 50% of the second SPV (and therefore a
nearly 6% stake in the joint venture) and that the SPV was used as a vehicle for corrupt payments. This failure was
due, in large part, to misrepresentations by the Chinese Official, the financial institution’s executive in charge of
the project, and the SPV’s attorney that the SPV was 100% owned and controlled by the government entity. DOJ
and SEC declined to take enforcement action against the financial institution, and its executive pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s internal control provisions and also settled with SEC.

Other Guidance on Compliance and
International Best Practices
In addition to this guide, the U.S. Departments of
Commerce and State have both issued publications that contain
guidance regarding compliance programs. The Department
of Commerce’s International Trade Administration has published Business Ethics: A Manual for Managing a Responsible
Business Enterprise in Emerging Market Economies,331 and the
Department of State has published Fighting Global Corruption:
Business Risk Management.332
There is also an emerging international consensus on
compliance best practices, and a number of inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations have issued
guidance regarding best practices for compliance.333 Most
notably, the OECD’s 2009 Anti-Bribery Recommendation
and its Annex II, Good Practice Guidance on Internal
Controls, Ethics, and Compliance,334 published in February

2010, were drafted based on consultations with the private
sector and civil society and set forth specific good practices
for ensuring effective compliance programs and measures
for preventing and detecting foreign bribery. In addition,

Hypothetical: Third-Party Vetting
Part 1: Consultants
Company A, a U.S. issuer headquartered in Delaware, wants to start doing business in a country that poses high risks
of corruption.  Company A learns about a potential $50 million contract with the country’s Ministry of Immigration. This
is a very attractive opportunity to Company A, both for its profitability and to open the door to future projects with the
government. At the suggestion of the company’s senior vice president of international sales (Sales Executive), Company A
hires a local businessman who assures them that he has strong ties to political and government leaders in the country and
can help them win the contract. Company A enters into a consulting contract with the local businessman (Consultant). The
agreement requires Consultant to use his best efforts to help the company win the business and provides for Consultant to
receive a significant monthly retainer as well as a success fee of 3% of the value of any contract the company wins.
What steps should Company A consider taking before hiring Consultant?
There are several factors here that might lead Company A to perform heightened FCPA-related due diligence prior
to retaining Consultant: (1) the market (high-risk country); (2) the size and significance of the deal to the company; (3) the
company’s first time use of this particular consultant; (4) the consultant’s strong ties to political and government leaders;
(5) the success fee structure of the contract; and (6) the vaguely-defined services to be provided. In order to minimize the
likelihood of incurring FCPA liability, Company A should carefully vet Consultant and his role in the transaction, including
close scrutiny of the relationship between Consultant and any Ministry of Immigration officials or other government officials.
Although there is nothing inherently illegal about contracting with a third party that has close connections to politicians
and government officials to perform legitimate services on a transaction, this type of relationship can be susceptible to
corruption. Among other things, Company A may consider conducting due diligence on Consultant, including background
(cont’d)

63

chapter 5

Guiding Principles
of Enforcement

and reference checks; ensuring that the contract spells out exactly what services and deliverables (such as written status
reports or other documentation) Consultant is providing; training Consultant on the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws;
requiring Consultant to represent that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws; including audit rights in the
contract (and exercising those rights); and ensuring that payments requested by Consultant have the proper supporting
documentation before they are approved for payment.

Part 2: Distributors and Local Partners
Assume the following alternative facts:
Instead of hiring Consultant, Company A retains an often-used local distributor (Distributor) to sell Company A’s
products to the Ministry of Immigration In negotiating the pricing structure, Distributor, which had introduced the project
to Company A, claims that the standard discount price to Distributor creates insufficient margin for Distributor to cover
warehousing, distribution, installation, marketing, and training costs and requests an additional discount or rebate, or, in
the alternative, a contribution to its marketing efforts, either in the form of a lump sum or as a percentage of the total
contract. The requested discount/allowance is significantly larger than usual, although there is precedent at Company
A for granting this level of discount in unique circumstances. Distributor further advises Company A that the Ministry’s
procurement officials responsible for awarding the contract have expressed a strong preference for including a particular
local company (Local Partner) in the transaction as a subcontractor of Company A to perform installation, training, and
other services that would normally have been performed by Distributor or Company A. According to Distributor, the
Ministry has a solid working relationship with Local Partner, and it would cause less disruption for Local Partner to perform
most of the on-site work at the Ministry. One of the principals (Principal 1) of the Local Partner is an official in another
government ministry.
What additional compliance considerations do these alternative facts raise?
As with Consultant in the first scenario above, Company A should carefully vet Distributor and Local Partner and their
roles in the transaction in order to minimize the likelihood of incurring FCPA liability. While Company A has an established
relationship with Distributor, the fact that Distributor has requested an additional discount warrants further inquiry into
the economic justification for the change, particularly where, as here, the proposed transaction structure contemplates
paying Local Partner to provide many of the same services that Distributor would otherwise provide. In many cases, it may
be appropriate for distributors to receive larger discounts to account for unique circumstances in particular transactions.
That said, a common mechanism to create additional margin for bribe payments is through excessive discounts or rebates
to distributors. Accordingly, when a company has pre-existing relationships with distributors and other third parties,
transaction-specific due diligence—including an analysis of payment terms to confirm that the payment is commensurate
with the work being performed—can be critical even in circumstances where due diligence of the distributor or other third
party raises no initial red flags.
Company A should carefully scrutinize the relationship among Local Partner, Distributor, and Ministry of Immigration
officials. While there is nothing inherently illegal about contracting with a third party that is recommended by the end-user,
or even hiring a government official to perform legitimate services on a transaction unrelated to his or her government
job, these facts raise additional red flags that warrant significant scrutiny. Among other things, Company A would be
well-advised to require Principal 1 to verify that he will have no role in the Ministry of Immigration’s decision to award
the contract to Company A, notify the Ministry of Immigration and his own ministry of his proposed involvement in the
transaction, and certify that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and that his involvement in the
transaction is permitted under local law.
(cont’d)

64

Assume the following additional facts:
Under its company policy for a government transaction of this size, Company A requires both finance and compliance
approval. The finance officer is concerned that the discounts to Distributor are significantly larger than what they have
approved for similar work and will cut too deeply into Company A’s profit margin. The finance officer is also skeptical about
including Local Partner to perform some of the same services that Company A is paying Distributor to perform. Unsatisfied
with Sales Executive’s explanation, she requests a meeting with Distributor and Principal 1. At the meeting, Distributor
and Principal 1 offer vague and inconsistent justifications for the payments and fail to provide any supporting analysis, and
Principal 1 seems to have no real expertise in the industry. During a coffee break, Distributor comments to Sales Executive
that the finance officer is naïve about “how business is done in my country.” Following the meeting, Sales Executive
dismisses the finance officer’s concerns, assuring her that the proposed transaction structure is reasonable and legitimate.
Sales Executive also reminds the finance officer that “the deal is key to their growth in the industry.”
The compliance officer focuses his due diligence on vetting Distributor and Local Partner and hires a business investigative
firm to conduct a background check. Distributor appears reputable, capable, and financially stable and is willing to take on
real risk in the project, financial and otherwise. However, the compliance officer learns that Distributor has established an
off-shore bank account for the transaction. The compliance officer further learns that Local Partner’s business was organized
two years ago and appears financially stable but has no expertise in the industry and has established an off-shore shell
company and bank account to conduct this transaction. The background check also reveals that Principal 1 is a former college
roommate of a senior official of the Ministry of Immigration. The Sales Executive dismisses the compliance officer’s concerns,
commenting that what Local Partner does with its payments “isn’t our problem.” Sales Executive also strongly objects to the
compliance officer’s request to meet with Principal 1 to discuss the off-shore company and account, assuring him that it was
done for legitimate tax purposes and complaining that if Company A continues to “harass” Local Partner and Distributor, they
would partner with Company A’s chief competitor. The compliance officer and the finance officer discuss their concerns with
each other but ultimately sign off on the deal even though their questions had not been answered. Their decision is motivated
in large part by their conversation with Sales Executive, who told them that this was the region’s most important contract
and that the detailed FCPA questionnaires and robust anti-corruption representations in the contracts placed the burden on
Distributor and Local Partner to act ethically.
Company A goes forward with the Distributor and Local Partner agreements and wins the contract after six months. The
finance officer approves Company A’s payments to Local Partner via the offshore account, even though Local Partner’s invoices
did not contain supporting detail or documentation of any services provided. Company A recorded the payments as legitimate
operational expenses on its books and records. Sales Executive received a large year-end bonus due to the award of the contract.
In fact, Local Partner and Distributor used part of the payments and discount margin, respectively, to funnel bribe payments
to several Ministry of Immigration officials, including Principal 1’s former college roommate, in exchange for awarding the
contract to Company A. Thousands of dollars are also wired to the personal offshore bank account of Sales Executive.
How would DOJ and SEC evaluate the potential FCPA liability of Company A and its employees?
This is not the case of a single “rogue employee” circumventing an otherwise robust compliance program. Although
Company A’s finance and compliance officers had the correct instincts to scrutinize the structure and economics of the
transaction and the role of the third parties, their due diligence was incomplete. When the initial inquiry identified significant
red flags, they approved the transaction despite knowing that their concerns were unanswered or the answers they received
raised additional concerns and red flags. Relying on due diligence questionnaires and anti-corruption representations is
insufficient, particularly when the risks are readily apparent. Nor can Company A or its employees shield themselves from
liability because it was Distributor and Local Partner—rather than Company A directly—that made the payments.
The facts suggest that Sales Executive had actual knowledge of or was willfully blind to the consultant’s payment of
the bribes. He also personally profited from the scheme (both from the kickback and from the bonus he received from the
company) and intentionally discouraged the finance and compliance officers from learning the full story. Sales Executive is
therefore subject to liability under the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and
others may be as well. Company A may also be liable for violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal
controls provisions of the FCPA given the number and significance of red flags that established a high probability of bribery
and the role of employees and agents acting on the company’s behalf.

those in which the company embraces the monitor or consultant. If the company takes the recommendations and
suggestions seriously and uses the monitoring period as a
time to find and fix any outstanding compliance issues, the
company can emerge from the monitorship with a stronger,
long-lasting compliance program.

Whistleblower
Provisions and
Protections

WHISTLEBLOWER PROVISIONS
AND PROTECTIONS
Assistance and information from a whistleblower who knows of possible securities law violations can be among the most powerful weapons in the law enforcement arsenal. Through their knowledge of the circumstances and individuals involved, whistleblowers can help SEC and DOJ identify potential violations
much earlier than might otherwise have been possible, thus allowing SEC and
DOJ to minimize the harm to investors, better preserve the integrity of the
U.S. capital markets, and more swiftly hold accountable those responsible for
unlawful conduct.

On August 12, 2011, the final rules for SEC’s
Whistleblower Program became effective. These rules set
forth the requirements for whistleblowers to be eligible for
awards consideration, the factors that SEC will use to determine the amount of the award, the categories of individuals
who are excluded from award consideration, and the categories of individuals who are subject to limitations in award
considerations.394 The final rules strengthen incentives for
employees to report the suspected violations internally
through internal compliance programs when appropriate,
although it does not require an employee to do so in order
to qualify for an award.395
Individuals with information about a possible violation of the federal securities laws, including FCPA violations, should submit that information to SEC either online
through SEC’s Tips, Complaints, and Referrals (TCR)
Intake and Resolution System (available at https://denebleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/disclaimer.xhtml) or by mailing or faxing a completed Form TCR to the Commission’s
Office of the Whistleblower.
Whistleblowers can submit information anonymously. To be considered under SEC’s whistleblower program as eligible for a reward, however, the information
must be submitted on an anonymous whistleblower’s behalf
by an attorney.396 Whether or not a whistleblower reports
anonymously, SEC is committed to protecting the identity
of a whistleblower to the fullest extent possible under the
statute.397 SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower administers
SEC’s Whistleblower Program and answers questions from
the public regarding the program. Additional information regarding SEC’s Whistleblower Program, including
answers to frequently asked questions, is available online at

DOJ Opinion
Procedure

DOJ OPINION PROCEDURE
DOJ’s opinion procedure is a valuable mechanism for companies and individuals to determine whether proposed conduct would be prosecuted by DOJ
under the FCPA.398 Generally speaking, under the opinion procedure process,
parties submit information to DOJ, after which DOJ issues an opinion about
whether the proposed conduct falls within its enforcement policy. All of DOJ’s
prior opinions are available online.399 Parties interested in obtaining such an
opinion should follow these steps:400

Fourth, the request must be signed. For corporate
requestors, the signatory should be an appropriate senior
officer with operational responsibility for the conduct that is
the subject of the request and who has been designated by the
corporation’s chief executive officer. In appropriate cases, DOJ
also may require the chief executive officer to sign the request.
Those signing the request must certify that it contains a true,
correct, and complete disclosure with respect to the proposed
conduct and the circumstances of the conduct. 408
Fifth, an original and five copies of the request should
be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of
the Criminal Division, Attention: FCPA Opinion Group.409
The mailing address is P.O. Box 28188 Central Station,
Washington, D.C. 20038. DOJ also asks that you send an
electronic courtesy copy to FCPA.Fraud@usdoj.gov.
DOJ will evaluate the request for an FCPA opinion.410
A party may withdraw a request for an opinion at any time
prior to the release of an opinion.411 If the request is complete
and all the relevant information has been submitted, DOJ will
respond to the request by issuing an opinion within 30 days.412
If the request is incomplete, DOJ will identify for the requestor
what additional information or documents are required for
DOJ to review the request. Such information must be provided to DOJ promptly. Once the additional information has
been received, DOJ will issue an opinion within 30 days of
receipt of that additional information.413 DOJ’s FCPA opinions state whether, for purposes of DOJ’s present enforcement
policy, the prospective conduct would violate either the issuer
or domestic concern anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.414
DOJ also may take other positions in the opinion as it considers appropriate.415 To the extent that the opinion concludes
that the proposed conduct would not violate the FCPA, a
rebuttable presumption is created that the requestor’s conduct that was the basis of the opinion is in compliance with
the FCPA.416 In order to provide non-binding guidance to the
business community, DOJ makes versions of its opinions publicly available on its website.417
If, after receiving an opinion, a party is concerned about
prospective conduct that is beyond the scope of conduct specified in a previous request, the party may submit an additional
request for an opinion using the procedures outlined above.418

Conclusion

CONCLUSION
The FCPA was designed to prevent corrupt practices, protect investors,
and provide a fair playing field for those honest companies trying to win business based on quality and price rather than bribes. Following Congress’ leadership in enacting the FCPA 35 years ago, and through determined international
diplomatic and law enforcement efforts in the time since, laws like the FCPA
prohibiting foreign bribery have been enacted by most of the United States’
major trading partners. 
This guide is designed to provide practical advice about, and useful insights into, our enforcement considerations. For businesses desiring to compete fairly in foreign markets, it is our goal to maximize those businesses’ ability
to comply with the FCPA in the most effective and efficient way suitable to their
business and the markets in which they operate. Through our ongoing efforts
with the U.S. and international business and legal communities and nongovernmental organizations, DOJ and SEC can continue effectively to protect
the integrity of our markets and reduce corruption around the world.

(2) general precautionary procedures which issuers may use on a voluntary basis to conform their conduct to the Department of Justice’s
present enforcement policy regarding the preceding provisions of this
section. The Attorney General shall issue the guidelines and procedures
referred to in the preceding sentence in accordance with the provisions
of subchapter II of chapter 5 of Title 5 and those guidelines and procedures shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 7 of that title.

(b) Exception for routine governmental action

(e) Opinions of Attorney General

Subsections (a) and (g) of this section shall not apply to any facilitating or expediting payment to a foreign official, political party, or party
official the purpose of which is to expedite or to secure the performance of a routine governmental action by a foreign official, political
party, or party official.

(1) The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate departments and agencies of the United States and after obtaining the views
of all interested persons through public notice and comment procedures, shall establish a procedure to provide responses to specific
inquiries by issuers concerning conformance of their conduct with the
Department of Justice’s present enforcement policy regarding the preceding provisions of this section. The Attorney General shall, within
30 days after receiving such a request, issue an opinion in response
to that request. The opinion shall state whether or not certain specified prospective conduct would, for purposes of the Department of

a preponderance of the evidence. In considering the presumption for
purposes of this paragraph, a court shall weight all relevant factors,
including but not limited to whether the information submitted to
the Attorney General was accurate and complete and whether it was
within the scope of the conduct specified in any request received by
the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall establish the procedure required by this paragraph in accordance with the provisions

1934]
Periodical and other reports
(a) Reports by issuer of security; contents
Every issuer of a security registered pursuant to section 78l of this title
shall file with the Commission, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate
for the proper protection of investors and to insure fair dealing in the
security—
(1) such information and documents (and such copies thereof ) as the
Commission shall require to keep reasonably current the information
and documents required to be included in or filed with an application or registration statement filed pursuant to section 78l of this title,
except that the Commission may not require the filing of any material
contract wholly executed before July 1, 1962.
(2) such annual reports (and such copies thereof ), certified if required
by the rules and regulations of the Commission by independent public accountants, and such quarterly reports (and such copies thereof ),
as the Commission may prescribe.

(1) The Commission may prescribe, in regard to reports made pursuant to this chapter, the form or forms in which the required information shall be set forth, the items or details to be shown in the balance
sheet and the earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in
the preparation of reports, in the appraisal or valuation of assets and
liabilities, in the determination of depreciation and depletion, in the
differentiation of recurring and nonrecurring income, in the differentiation of investment and operating income, and in the preparation,
where the Commission deems it necessary or desirable, of separate
and/or consolidated balance sheets or income accounts of any person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer, or any
person under direct or indirect common control with the issuer; but
in the case of the reports of any person whose methods of accounting
are prescribed under the provisions of any law of the United States,
or any rule or regulation thereunder, the rules and regulations of the
Commission with respect to reports shall not be inconsistent with
the requirements imposed by such law or rule or regulation in respect
of the same subject matter (except that such rules and regulations of
the Commission may be inconsistent with such requirements to the
extent that the Commission determines that the public interest or the
protection of investors so requires).
(2) Every issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant to
section 78l of this title and every issuer which is required to file reports
pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title shall—

100

(A) make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the issuer;
(B) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that—
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general
or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II)
to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and
(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences; and
(C) notwithstanding any other provision of law, pay the allocable
share of such issuer of a reasonable annual accounting support fee or
fees, determined in accordance with section 7219 of this title.

(6) Where an issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant to section 78l of this title or an issuer which is required to file
reports pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title holds 50 per centum
or less of the voting power with respect to a domestic or foreign firm,
the provisions of paragraph (2) require only that the issuer proceed
in good faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under the
issuer’s circumstances, to cause such domestic or foreign firm to devise
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls consistent with
paragraph (2). Such circumstances include the relative degree of the
issuer’s ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and the laws and
practices governing the business operations of the country in which
such firm is located. An issuer which demonstrates good faith efforts
to use such influence shall be conclusively presumed to have complied
with the requirements of paragraph (2).
(7) For the purpose of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the terms “reasonable assurances” and “reasonable detail” mean such level of detail
and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct of their own affairs.

95-640], available at http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/
history/1977/houseprt-95-640.pdf. The House Report made clear
Congress’s concerns:
The payment of bribes to influence the acts or
decisions of foreign officials, foreign political parties
or candidates for foreign political office is unethical.
It is counter to the moral expectations and values of
the American public. But not only is it unethical, it
is bad business as well. It erodes public confidence
in the integrity of the free market system. It shortcircuits the marketplace by directing business to
those companies too inefficient to compete in terms
of price, quality or service, or too lazy to engage in
honest salesmanship, or too intent upon unloading
marginal products. In short, it rewards corruption
instead of efficiency and puts pressure on ethical
enterprises to lower their standards or risk losing
business.

See, e.g., U.S. Agency for Int’l Dev., USAID Anticorruption
Strategy 5-6 (2005), available at http://transition.usaid.gov/policy/
ads/200/200mbo.pdf. The growing recognition that corruption poses
a severe threat to domestic and international security has galvanized
efforts to combat it in the United States and abroad. See, e.g., Int’l AntiCorruption and Good Governance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-309,
§ 202, 114 Stat. 1090 (codified as amended at 22 U.S.C. §§ 2151-2152
(2000)) (noting that “[w]idespread corruption endangers the stability
and security of societies, undermines democracy, and jeopardizes the
social, political, and economic development of a society. . . . [and that]
[c]orruption facilitates criminal activities, such as money laundering,
hinders economic development, inflates the costs of doing business, and
undermines the legitimacy of the government and public trust”).

http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW900.pdf (“No problem does
more to alienate citizens from their political leaders and institutions,
and to undermine political stability and economic development, than
endemic corruption among the government, political party leaders,
judges, and bureaucrats. The more endemic the corruption is, the more
1

likely it is to be accompanied by other serious deficiencies in the rule of
law: smuggling, drug trafficking, criminal violence, human rights abuses,
and personalization of power.”).

President George W. Bush observed in 2006 that “the culture of
corruption has undercut development and good governance and
. . . . impedes our efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end
poverty, and combat international crime and terrorism.” President’s
Statement on Kleptocracy, 2 Pub. Papers 1504 (Aug. 10, 2006),
available at http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/
releases/2006/08/20060810.html. The administrations of former
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama both recognized
the threats posed to security and stability by corruption. For instance,
in issuing a proclamation restricting the entry of certain corrupt foreign
public officials, former President George W. Bush recognized “the
serious negative effects that corruption of public institutions has on the
United States’ efforts to promote security and to strengthen democratic
institutions and free market systems. . . .” Proclamation No. 7750, 69
Fed. Reg. 2287 ( Jan. 14, 2004). Similarly, President Barack Obama’s
National Security Strategy paper, released in May 2010, expressed the
administration’s efforts and commitment to promote the recognition that
“pervasive corruption is a violation of basic human rights and a severe
impediment to development and global security.” The White House,

For example, in a number of recent enforcement actions, the same
employees who were directing or controlling the bribe payments were
also enriching themselves at the expense of the company. See, e.g.,

of Economic Cooperation and Development, to
govern persons from those countries concerning
acts prohibited with respect to issuers and domestic

Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
International Business Transactions art. 1.1, Dec. 18, 1997, 37 I.L.M. 1
[hereinafter Anti-Bribery Convention]. The Anti-Bribery Convention
requires member countries to make it a criminal offense “for any person
intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other

105

advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign
public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the
official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of
official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper
advantage in the conduct of international business.” The Convention
and its commentaries also call on all parties (a) to ensure that aiding and
abetting and authorization of an act of bribery are criminal offenses, (b)
to assert territorial jurisdiction “broadly so that an extensive physical
connection to the bribery act is not required,” and (c) to assert nationality
jurisdiction consistent with the general principles and conditions of each
party’s legal system. Id. at art. 1.2, cmts. 25, 26.

67
In amending the FCPA in 1988, Congress made clear that the business
purpose element, and specifically the “retaining business” prong, was
meant to be interpreted broadly:
The Conferees wish to make clear that the reference
to corrupt payments for “retaining business” in
present law is not limited to the renewal of contracts
or other business, but also includes a prohibition
against corrupt payments related to the execution
or performance of contracts or the carrying out of
existing business, such as a payment to a foreign

107

official for the purpose of obtaining more favorable
tax treatment. The term should not, however, be
construed so broadly as to include lobbying or other
normal representations to government officials.

United States v. Kay, 359 F.3d 738, 755-56 (5th Cir. 2004).
70
Id. at 749. Indeed, the Kay court found that Congress’ explicit
exclusion of facilitation payments from the scope of the FCPA was
evidence that “Congress intended for the FCPA to prohibit all other
illicit payments that are intended to influence non-trivial official foreign
action in an effort to aid in obtaining or retaining business for some
person.” Id. at 749-50 (emphasis added).
71
Id. at 750.
72
Id. at 749-55.
73
Id. at 756 (“It still must be shown that the bribery was intended to
produce an effect—here, through tax savings—that would ‘assist in
obtaining or retaining business.’”).
74
The FCPA does not explicitly define “corruptly,” but in drafting the
statute Congress adopted the meaning ascribed to the same term in the
domestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-640,
at 7.
75
The House Report states in full:
The word “corruptly” is used in order to make
clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must
be intended to induce the recipient to misuse
his official position; for example, wrongfully to
direct business to the payor or his client, to obtain
preferential legislation or regulations, or to induce a
foreign official to fail to perform an official function.
The word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or
purpose such as that required under 18 U.S.C.
201(b) which prohibits domestic bribery. As in
18 U.S.C. 201(b), the word “corruptly” indicates
an intent or desire wrongfully to influence the
recipient. It does not require that the act [be] fully
consummated or succeed in producing the desired
outcome.
Id. The Senate Report provides a nearly identical explanation of the
meaning of the term:
The word “corruptly” is used in order to make
clear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must
be intended to induce the recipient to misuse
his official position in order to wrongfully direct
business to the payor or his client, or to obtain

preferential legislation or a favorable regulation.
The word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or
purpose, an intent to wrongfully influence the
recipient.

86
The phrase “anything of value” is not defined in the FCPA, but the
identical phrase under the domestic bribery statute has been broadly
construed to include both tangible and intangible benefits. See, e.g.,
United States v. Moore, 525 F.3d 1033, 1048 (11th Cir. 2008) (rejecting
defendant’s objection to instruction defining sex as a “thing of value,”
which “unambiguously covers intangible considerations”); United
States v. Gorman, 807 F.2d 1299, 1304-05 (6th Cir. 1986) (holding that
loans and promises of future employment are “things of value”); United
States v. Williams, 705 F.2d 603, 622-23 (2d Cir. 1983) (approving jury
instruction that stock could be a “thing of value” if defendant believed it
had value, even though the shares had no commercial value, and noting
that “[t]he phrase ‘anything of value’ in bribery and related statutes has
consistently been given a broad meaning”).
87
Section 30A(a), 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(a); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(a), 78dd3(a) (emphasis added).
88
Like the FCPA, the domestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, prohibits
giving, offering, or promising “anything of value.” Numerous domestic

AP P ENDIX
E nd notes

bribery cases under Section 201 have involved “small” dollar bribes.
See, e.g., United States v. Franco, 632 F.3d 880, 882-84 (5th Cir. 2011)
(affirming bribery convictions of inmate for paying correctional officer
$325 to obtain cell phone, food, and marijuana, and noting that 18
U.S.C. § 201 does not contain minimum monetary threshold); United

113
Under the FCPA, any person “acting in an official capacity for
or on behalf of ” a foreign government, a department, agency, or
instrumentality thereof, or a public international organization, is a
foreign official. Section 30A(f )(1)(A), 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(f )(1)(A); 15
U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(h)(2)(A), 78dd-2(f )(2)(A). See also U.S. Dept. of

(4) (facilitating payments exception).
115
Even though payments to a foreign government may not violate the
anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, such payments may violate other
U.S. laws, including wire fraud, money laundering, and the FCPA’s
accounting provisions. This was the case in a series of matters brought by
DOJ and SEC involving kickbacks to the Iraqi government through the
United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme. See, e.g., Complaint, SEC v.

The United States has some state-owned entities, like the Tennessee
Valley Authority, that are instrumentalities of the government. McCarthy
v. Middle Tenn. Elec. Membership Corp., 466 F.3d 399, 411 n.18
(6th Cir. 2006) (“[T]here is no question that TVA is an agency and
instrumentality of the United States.”) (internal quotes omitted).
117
During the period surrounding the FCPA’s adoption, state-owned
entities held virtual monopolies and operated under state-controlled
price-setting in many national industries around the world. See generally
World Bank, Bureaucrats in Business: The Economics
and Politics of Government Ownership, World Bank
Policy Research Report at 78 (1995); Sunita Kikeri and
Aishetu Kolo, State Enterprises, The World Bank Group
(Feb. 2006), available at http://rru.worldbank.org/documents/

Id. at 1 (“[A]fter more than two decades of privatization, government
ownership and control remains widespread in many regions—and in
many parts of the world still dominates certain sectors.”).
119
To date, consistent with the approach taken by DOJ and SEC, all
district courts that have considered this issue have concluded that this is
an issue of fact for a jury to decide. See Order, United States v. Carson,
2011 WL 5101701, No. 09-cr-77 (C.D. Cal. May 18, 2011), ECF No.

admitted to violating the FCPA by bribing officials of state-owned or
state-controlled entities. See Government’s Opposition to Defendants’

See Section 30A(f )(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(f )
(2)(A); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(h)(3)(A), 78dd-3(f )(3)(A).
139
See Section 30A(f )(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(f )
(2)(B); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(h)(3)(B), 78dd-3(f )(3)(B). The “knowing”
standard was intended to cover “both prohibited actions that are taken
with ‘actual knowledge’ of intended results as well as other actions
that, while falling short of what the law terms ‘positive knowledge,’
nevertheless evidence a conscious disregard or deliberate ignorance
of known circumstances that should reasonably alert one to the high
probability of violations of the Act.” H.R. Rep. No. 100-576, at 920; see
also Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100418, § 5003, 102 Stat. 1107, 1423-24 (1988).

H.R. Rep. No. 100-576, at 922. The conferees also noted that “[i]n

normal rules of legal construction would apply.” Id.
143
See United States v. Kozeny, 582 F. Supp. 2d 535, 537-40 (S.D.N.Y.
2008). Likewise, the court found that a provision under Azeri law that
relieved bribe payors of criminal liability if they were extorted did
not make the bribe payments legal. Azeri extortion law precludes the
prosecution of the payor of the bribes for the illegal payments, but it does
not make the payments legal. Id. at 540-41.

For example, DOJ has previously approved expenditures on behalf of
family members or for entertainment purposes under certain, limited
circumstances. See, e.g., U.S. Dept. of Justice, FCPA Rev. P. Release
83-02 ( July 26, 1983) (declining to take enforcement action against
company seeking to provide promotional tour for foreign official and
wife, where both had already planned a trip to the United States at their
own expense and company proposed to pay only for all reasonable and
necessary actual domestic expenses for the extension of their travel to
allow the promotional tour, which would not exceed $5,000), available at
http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/review/1983/r8302.pdf.
159
Unlike the local law and bona fide expenditures defenses, the
facilitating payments exception is not an affirmative defense to the
FCPA. Rather, payments of this kind fall outside the scope of the
FCPA’s bribery prohibition. Prior to 1988, the “facilitating payments”
exception was incorporated into the definition of “foreign official,” which
excluded from the statute’s purview officials whose duties were primarily
ministerial or clerical. See Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, Pub.
L. No. 95-213, § 104(d)(2), 91 Stat. 1494, 1498 (1977) (providing that
the term foreign official “does not include any employee of a foreign
government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof whose
duties are essentially ministerial or clerical”). The original exception thus
focused on the duties of the recipient, rather than the purpose of the
payment. In practice, however, it proved difficult to determine whether
a foreign official’s duties were “ministerial or clerical.” S. Rep. No. 10085, at 53. Responding to criticism that the statutory language “does not
clearly reflect Congressional intent and the boundaries of the prohibited
conduct,” Congress revised the FCPA to define the exception in terms of
the purpose of the payment. H. Rep. No. 100-40, pt. 2, at 77. In doing so,
Congress reiterated that while its policy to exclude facilitating payments
reflected practical considerations of enforcement, “such payments should
not be condoned.” Id. The enacted language reflects this narrow purpose.
160
In exempting facilitating payments, Congress sought to distinguish
them as “payments which merely move a particular matter toward an

111

eventual act or decision or which do not involve any discretionary action,”
giving the examples of “a gratuity paid to a customs official to speed the
processing of a customs document” or “payments made to secure permits,
licenses, or the expeditious performance of similar duties of an essentially
ministerial or clerical nature which must of necessity be performed in any
event.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-640, at 8.
161
Section 30A(f )(3)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(f )(3)
(B); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(h)(4)(B), 78dd-3(f )(4)(B).
162
In a 2004 decision, the Fifth Circuit emphasized this precise point,
commenting on the limited nature of the facilitating payments exception:
A brief review of the types of routine governmental
actions enumerated by Congress shows how limited
Congress wanted to make the grease exceptions.
Routine governmental action, for instance, includes
“obtaining permits, licenses, or other official
documents to qualify a person to do business in
a foreign country,” and “scheduling inspections
associated with contract performance or inspections
related to transit of goods across country.”
Therefore, routine governmental action does not
include the issuance of every official document or
every inspection, but only (1) documentation that
qualifies a party to do business and (2) scheduling an
inspection—very narrow categories of largely nondiscretionary, ministerial activities performed by
mid- or low-level foreign functionaries.

These payments, however, must be accurately reflected in the
company’s books and records so that the company and its management
are aware of the payments and can assure that the payments were properly
made under the circumstances. For example, in one instance, a Kazakh
immigration prosecutor threatened to fine, jail, or deport employees
of a U.S. company’s subsidiary. Believing the threats to be genuine, the
employees in Kazakhstan sought guidance from senior management
of the U.S. subsidiary and were authorized to make the payments. The
employees then paid the government official a total of $45,000 using
personal funds. The subsidiary reimbursed the employees, but it falsely
recorded the reimbursements as “salary advances” or “visa fines.” The
parent company, which eventually discovered these payments, as well
as other improperly booked cash payments made to a Kazakhstani
consultant to obtain visas, was charged with civil violations of the
accounting provisions. Admin. Proceeding Order, In the Matter of

not capital, unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted

113

within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.”
See Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 396-97 (1957)
(holding government must prove conspiracy still existed and at least
one overt act was committed within the statute of limitations); Fiswick
v. United States, 329 U.S. 211, 216 (1946) (“The statute of limitations,
unless suspended, runs from the last overt act during the existence of
the conspiracy. The overt acts averred and proved may thus mark the
duration, as well as the scope, of the conspiracy.”) (citation omitted); see

has been concealed by the falsification of corporate books and records,”
that the accounting provisions “remove [] this avenue of coverup,” and
that “[t]aken together, the accounting requirements and criminal [antibribery] prohibitions . . . should effectively deter corporate bribery of
foreign government officials”).

The accounting provisions contain a narrow exemption related to
national security and the protection of classified information. Under
this “national security” provision, “no duty or liability [under Section
13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act] shall be imposed upon any person acting
in cooperation with the head of any federal department or agency
responsible for such matters if such act in cooperation with such head of
a department or agency was done upon the specific, written directive of
the head of such department or agency pursuant to Presidential authority
to issue such directives.” Section 13(b)(3) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
§ 78m(b)(3). As Congress made clear, however, the exception is narrowly
tailored and intended to prevent the disclosure of classified information.

about audit failures and financial fraud and resultant recommendations
by experts for stronger accounting practices and audit standards.” Id.

Although private companies are not covered by the books and records
and internal controls provisions of the FCPA and do not fall within
SEC’s jurisdiction, such companies generally are required by federal and
state tax laws and state corporation laws to maintain accurate books and
records sufficient to properly calculate taxes owed. Further, most large
private companies maintain their books and records to facilitate the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP to comply
with financial institutions’ lending requirements.
247
See SEC v. RAE Sys. Inc., supra note 92; In re RAE Sys. Inc., supra note

248
See Section 13(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b) (6),
which provides that where an issuer “holds 50 per centum or less of the
voting power with respect to a domestic or foreign firm,” the issuer must
“proceed in good faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under
the issuer’s circumstances, to cause such domestic or foreign firm to devise
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls consistent with
[Section 13(b)(2)].”
249
See 15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(6). Congress added the language in subsection 78m(b)(6) to the FCPA in 1988, recognizing that “it is
unrealistic to expect a minority owner to exert a disproportionate degree
of influence over the accounting practices of a subsidiary.” H.R. Rep.
No. 100-576, at 917. The Conference Report noted that, with respect
to minority owners, “the amount of influence which an issuer may
exercise necessarily varies from case to case. While the relative degree of
ownership is obviously one factor, other factors may also be important in
determining whether an issuer has demonstrated good-faith efforts to use
its influence.” Id.; see also S. Rep. No. 100-85, at 50.
250
Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, titled “Prosecution of Persons
Who Aid and Abet Violations,” explicitly provides that for purposes of
a civil action seeking injunctive relief or a civil penalty, “any person that
knowingly or recklessly provides substantial assistance to another person
in violation of a provision of this title, or of any rule or regulation issued
under this title, shall be deemed to be in violation of such provision to
the same extent as the person to whom such assistance is provided.” See

controls.” See S. Rep. No. 100-85, at 49; H.R. Rep. No. 100-576, at

Foreign officials may “not be charged with violating the FCPA itself,
since the [FCPA] does not criminalize the receipt of a bribe by a foreign
official.” United States v. Blondek, 741 F.Supp. 116, 117 (N.D. Tex.
1990), aff ’d United States v. Castle, 925 F.2d 831 (5th Cir. 1991) (“We
hold that foreign officials may not be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. §
371 for conspiring to violate the FCPA.”). Foreign officials, however,
can be charged with violating the FCPA when the foreign official acts
as an intermediary of a bribe payment. See, e.g., Information, United
States v. Basu, No. 02-cr-475 (D.D.C. Nov. 26, 2002) (World Bank

For example, in United States v. BAE Systems plc, BAE pleaded guilty
to conspiring to defraud the United States by impairing and impeding its
lawful functions, to making false statements about its FCPA compliance
program, and to violating the AECA and ITAR.  BAE paid a $400
million fine and agreed to an independent corporate monitor to ensure
compliance with applicable anti-corruption and export control laws.

cases/bae-system/03-01-10baesystems-plea-agree.pdf. In an action based
on the same underlying facts as the criminal guilty plea, BAE entered
a civil settlement with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for
violations of AECA and ITAR, including over 2500 ITAR violations
that included a failure to report the payment of fees or commissions
associated with defense transactions and failure to maintain records
involving ITAR-controlled transactions.  BAE paid $79 million in
penalties, and the State Department imposed a “policy of denial” for
export licenses on three BAE subsidiaries involved in the wrongful
conduct. Consent Agreement between BAE Sys. plc and Defense Trade

Debarment authorities, such as the Department of Defense or
the General Services Administration, may also consider a company’s
compliance program when deciding whether to debar or suspend
a contractor. Specifically, the relevant regulations provide that the
debarment authority should consider “[w]hether the contractor had
effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at
the time of the activity which constitutes cause for debarment or had
adopted such procedures prior to any Government investigation of the
activity cited as a cause for debarment,” and “[w]hether the contractor
has instituted or agreed to institute new or revised review and control
procedures and ethics training programs.” 48 C.F.R. § 9.406-1(a).

USAM § 9-28.300. When evaluating the pervasiveness of wrongdoing
within the corporation, prosecutors are advised that while it may be
appropriate to charge a corporation for minor misconduct where the
wrongdoing was pervasive, “it may not be appropriate to impose liability
upon a corporation, particularly one with a robust compliance program in
place, under a strict respondeat superior theory for the single isolated act
of a rogue employee.” Id. § 9-28.500.A (emphasis added). Prosecutors
should also consider a company’s compliance program when examining
any remedial actions taken, including efforts to implement an effective
compliance program or to improve an existing one. As the commentary
explains, “although the inadequacy of a corporate compliance program is
a factor to consider when deciding whether to charge a corporation, that
corporation’s quick recognition of the flaws in the program and its efforts
to improve the program are also factors to consider as to appropriate
disposition of a case.” Id. § 9-28.900.B. Finally, the Principles of Federal
Prosecution of Business Organizations provides that prosecutors should
consider the existence and effectiveness of the corporation’s pre-existing
compliance program in determining how to treat a corporate target. Id.
§ 9-28.800.

This is also reflected in the Sentencing Guidelines, which recognizes
that no single, formulaic set of requirements should be imposed, but
instead focuses on a number of factors like applicable industry practice
or the standards called for by any applicable governmental regulation,
the size of the organization, and whether the organization has engaged
in similar misconduct in the past. See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines §
8B2.1 & app. note 2 (2011).
311
This was underscored by then-SEC Commissioner Cynthia Glassman
in 2003 in a speech on the SEC’s implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act: “[T]he ultimate effectiveness of the new corporate governance rules
will be determined by the ‘tone at the top.’ Adopting a code of ethics
means little if the company’s chief executive officer or its directors make
clear, by conduct or otherwise, that the code’s provisions do not apply
to them. . . . Corporate officers and directors hold the ultimate power

116

and responsibility for restoring public trust by conducting themselves
in a manner that is worthy of the trust that is placed in them.” Cynthia
Glassman, SEC Implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley: The New Corporate
Governance, Remarks at National Economists Club (April 7, 2003),
available at http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch040703cag.htm .
312
Indeed, research has found that “[e]thical culture is the single biggest
factor determining the amount of misconduct that will take place in a
business.”  Ethics Resource Center, 2009 National Business
Ethics Survey: Ethics in the Recession (2009), at 41.  Metrics
of ethical culture include ethical leadership (tone at the top), supervisor
reinforcement of ethical behavior (middle management reinforcement),
and peer commitment (supporting one another in doing the right
thing).  Ethics Resource Center, 2011 National Business
Ethics Survey: Workplace Ethics in Transition (2012) at 19. 
Strong ethical cultures and strong ethics and compliance programs are
related, as data show that a well-implemented program helps lead to a
strong ethical culture.  Id. at 34.  “Understanding the nature of any gap
between the desired culture and the actual culture is a critical first step in
determining the nature of any ethics-based risks inside the organization.” 
David Gebler, The Role of Culture at 1.7, in Society of Corporate
Compliance and Ethics, The Complete Compliance and
Ethics Manual (2011).  To create an ethical culture, attention must be
paid to norms at all levels of an organization, including the “tone at the
top,” “mood in the middle,” and “buzz at the bottom.”  Id. 1.9-1.10.

DOJ has recently declined matters where some or all of the following
circumstances were present: (1) a corporation voluntarily and fully
disclosed the potential misconduct; (2) corporate principles voluntarily
engaged in interviews with DOJ and provided truthful and complete
information about their conduct; (3) a parent company conducted
extensive pre-acquisition due diligence of potentially liable subsidiaries
and engaged in significant remediation efforts post-acquisition; (4) a
company provided information about its extensive compliance policies,
procedures, and internal controls; (5) a company agreed to a civil
resolution with the Securities and Exchange Commission while also

Director Pleads Guilty for Role in Evading Internal Controls Required

pr/2012/April/12-crm-534.html (“After considering all the available
facts and circumstances, including that Morgan Stanley constructed and
maintained a system of internal controls, which provided reasonable
assurances that its employees were not bribing government officials, the
Department of Justice declined to bring any enforcement action against
Morgan Stanley related to Peterson’s conduct. The company voluntarily
disclosed this matter and has cooperated throughout the department’s
investigation.”); see also Press Release, U.S. Sec. and Exchange Comm.,

391
18 U.S.C. § 1513(e).
392
15 U.S.C. § 78u-6(a)(3). The new provision defines “original
information” to mean information that:
(A) is derived from the independent knowledge
or analysis of a whistleblower; (B) is not known
to the Commission from any other source, unless
the whistleblower is the original source of the
information; and (C) is not exclusively derived from
an allegation made in a judicial or administrative
hearing, in a governmental report, hearing, audit,
or investigation, or from the news media, unless the
whistleblower is a source of the information.
393
15 U.S.C. § 78u-6; see also Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, § 922, 124 Stat. 1376,
1841-49 (2010).
394
For detailed information about the program, including eligibility
requirements and certain limitations that apply, see Section 922 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, available
at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/owb/dodd-frank-sec-922.pdf,
and the final rules on eligibility, Exchange Act Rule 21F-8, 17 C.F.R. §
240.21F-8.
395
For example, the rules: (1) make a whistleblower eligible for an award
if the whistleblower reports original information internally, and the
company informs the SEC about the violations; (2) give whistleblowers
120 days to report information to the SEC after first reporting
382

internally and still be treated as if he or she had reported to the SEC
at the earlier reporting date , thus preserving their “place in line” for
a possible whistleblower award from the SEC; and (3) provide that a
whistleblower’s voluntary participation in an entity’s internal compliance
and reporting systems is a factor that can increase the amount of an
award, and that a whistleblower’s interference with internal compliance
and reporting system is a factor that can decrease the amount of an award.
See Exchange Act Rule 21F, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F.
396
See Exchange Act Rule 21F-7(b), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-7(b).
397
For example, SEC staff will not disclose a whistleblower’s identity in
response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. However,
there are limits on SEC’s ability to shield a whistleblower’s identity,
and in certain circumstances SEC must disclose it to outside entities.
For example, in an administrative or court proceeding, SEC may be
required to produce documents or other information that would
reveal the whistleblower’s identity. In addition, as part of ongoing
SEC investigatory responsibilities, SEC staff may use information
provided by a whistleblower during the course of the investigation. In
appropriate circumstances, SEC may also provide information, subject
to confidentiality requirements, to other governmental or regulatory
entities. Exchange Act Rule 21F-7(a), 17 C.F.R. 240.21F-7(a).
398
Although SEC does not have an opinion procedure release process,
it has declared its decision to follow the guidance announced through
DOJ’s FCPA Opinion Release Procedure. U.S. Sec. and Exchange
Comm., SEC Release No. 34-17099 (Aug. 29, 1980), available at http://
www.sec.gov/news/digest/1980/dig082980.pdf. SEC Release No. 3417099 stated that, to encourage issuers to take advantage of the DOJ’s
FCPA Review Procedure, as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, SEC
would “not take enforcement action alleging violations of Section 30A
in any case where an issuer has sought and obtained an FCPA Review
letter from the Department, prior to May 31, 1981, stating that the
Department will not take enforcement action under Section 30A with
respect to the transaction involved.” Id. The release further noted that it
would revisit this policy once the DOJ had evaluated the results of the
FCPA Review Procedure after its first year of operation. A second release
stated that the SEC would continue to adhere to the policy announced
in Release No. 34-17099. U.S. Sec. and Exchange Comm., SEC Release
No. 34-18255 (Nov. 13, 1981), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/
digest/1981/dig111381.pdf.
399
Both DOJ’s opinion procedure releases (from 1993 to present) and
review procedure releases (from 1980-1992) are available at http://www.
justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/opinion.
400
The full regulations relating to DOJ’s opinion procedure are available
at http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/docs/frgncrpt.pdf.
401
28 C.F.R. § 80.1.
402
28 C.F.R. § 80.3.
403
28 C.F.R. § 80.12 (“Neither the submission of a request for an
FCPA Opinion, its pendency, nor the issuance of an FCPA Opinion,
shall in any way alter the responsibility of an issuer to comply with the
accounting requirements of 15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(2) and (3).”).
404
28 C.F.R. § 80.4.
405
28 C.F.R. § 80.5.
406
28 C.F.R. § 80.6.
407
28 C.F.R. § 80.14(a). This non-disclosure policy applies regardless of
whether DOJ responds to the request or the party withdraws the request
before receiving a response. Id.
408
28 C.F.R. § 80.6.
409
28 C.F.R. § 80.2.
410
In connection with any request for an FCPA opinion, DOJ may
conduct whatever independent investigation it believes appropriate. 28
C.F.R. § 80.7.
411
28 C.F.R. § 80.15. Once a request is withdrawn, it has no effect.
However, DOJ reserves the right to retain a copy of any FCPA
opinion request, documents, and information submitted during the
opinion release procedure for any governmental purpose, subject to the
restrictions on disclosures in 28 C.F.R. § 80.14.
412
28 C.F.R. § 80.8.
413
28 C.F.R. § 80.7. “Such additional information, if furnished orally,
must be confirmed in writing promptly. The same person who signed
the initial request must sign the written, supplemental information and
must again certify it to be a true, correct and complete disclosure of the
requested information.” Id.

28 C.F.R. § 80.9 (“No oral clearance, release or other statement
purporting to limit the enforcement discretion of the Department of
Justice may be given. The requesting issuer or domestic concern may rely
only upon a written FCPA opinion letter signed by the Attorney General
or his designee.”).
415
28 C.F.R. § 80.8. FCPA opinions do not bind or obligate any agency
other than DOJ. They also do not affect the requesting party’s obligations
to any other agency or under any statutory or regulatory provision other
than those specifically cited in the particular FCPA opinion. 28 C.F.R. §
80.11. If the conduct for which an FCPA opinion is requested is subject
to approval by any other agency, such FCPA opinion may not be taken
to indicate DOJ’s views on any legal or factual issues before that other
agency. 28 C.F.R. § 80.13.
416
28 C.F.R. § 80.10. DOJ can rebut this presumption by a
preponderance of the evidence. A court determining whether the
presumption has been rebutted weighs all relevant factors, including
whether the submitted information was accurate and complete and the
activity was within the scope of conduct specified in the request. Id. As of
September 2012, DOJ has never pursued an enforcement action against a
party for conduct that formed the basis of an FCPA opinion stating that
the prospective conduct would violate DOJ’s present enforcement policy.
417
As a general matter, DOJ normally anonymizes much of the
information in its publicly released opinions and includes the general
nature and circumstances of the proposed conduct. DOJ does not release
the identity of any foreign sales agents or other types of identifying
information. 28 C.F.R. § 80.14(b). However, DOJ may release the
identity of the requesting party, the foreign country in which the
proposed conduct is to take place, and any actions DOJ took in response
to the FCPA opinion request. Id. If a party believes that an opinion
contains proprietary information, it may request that DOJ remove or
anonymize those portions of the opinion before it is publicly released. 28
C.F.R. § 80.14(c).
418
28 C.F.R. § 80.16.
