Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by Macau
Resources Group Ltd. (“Macau Resources” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a) of the Rules
of Practice of the Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these
proceedings initiated against Respondent on May 20, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to Macau Resources Group Ltd. (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that 1 :
1.
Macau Resources (CIK No. 1557436) is a British Virgin Islands corporation
located in Hong Kong. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the securities of Macau
Resources have been registered under Exchange Act Section 12(g). As of May 9, 2016, the
company’s stock (symbol “MRGLF”) was quoted on OTC Link, had two market makers,
and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
2.
Macau Resources has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a)
and Rule 13a-1 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports with the
Commission since the period ended December 31, 2013.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is, revoked.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
