SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Respondent.

On Petition for Review of an Order of the
Securities and Exchange Commission

BRIEF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
RESPONDENT
______________________________________________

INTRODUCTION
The Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq, prohibits
various transactions and arrangements involving serious conflicts of interest
between investment companies (“funds”) and their managers. The Act, however,
gives the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to adopt rules granting
exemptions, including conditional exemptions, from these prohibitions when such
exemptions are consistent with the purposes of the Act. Petitioner Chamber of

Commerce seeks review of an order issued by the Commission adopting
amendments to ten such exemptive rules. 1/ Each of the ten rules (“Exemptive
Rules”) has for some years contained a condition requiring oversight of the
exempted transaction or arrangement by fund directors who are independent of the
fund’s management company. The rule amendments that are the subject of the
petition impose two new conditions on funds that seek to rely on any of the
Exemptive Rules: (i) at least 75 percent of the directors of the fund must be
independent (an increase from the prior condition of a simple majority); and (ii)
the chairman of the fund’s board must be an independent director. These
conditions were adopted to enhance the protection of funds and their shareholders.
It is these two conditions that are challenged by petitioner.
The Commission adopted the amendments in the face of mounting evidence
that mutual fund managers were misusing their positions of trust to favor
themselves at the expense of fund investors, thereby inflicting huge losses on
investors and leading them to withdraw large amounts of their fund investments

because of their lost trust in the funds. 2/ This misconduct, which involved
managers of leading fund groups, cost investors more than half a billion dollars.
As a part of its broad response to these well-publicized scandals, the Commission
reevaluated the conditions imposed on funds and their affiliates that rely on the
Exemptive Rules – conditions designed to safeguard the interests of fund investors
from the conflicts of interest inherent in the transactions permitted under the rules.
After considering comments received from nearly 200 commenters, and as part of
a larger package of reforms designed to restore investor confidence in the nation’s
mutual funds, the Commission determined it was necessary to strengthen
independent director oversight under the Exemptive Rules.
Independent director oversight of conflicts of interest has always been a
critical aspect of the extensive corporate governance provisions of the Act, and
has long been a cornerstone of the Exemptive Rules. Indeed, the Exemptive Rules
have been conditioned upon independent director oversight of the transactions
permitted under the rules since the rules were adopted (or amended) at various
times over the last 50 years. This independent director oversight was strengthened
in 2001, when the Commission amended the Exemptive Rules to include the
condition that a majority of the fund’s board be independent, and again in 2004

when it added the two conditions challenged by petitioner. In so acting, the
Commission was doing precisely what Congress intended by expressly authorizing
the Commission to grant exemptions to prohibitions under the Act, “conditionally
or unconditionally,” when the exemptions are consistent with the purposes of the
Act. See Section 6(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-6(c).
COUNTERSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION
A.

Petitioner Has Not Demonstrated Its Standing to Bring This Petition.

The petition should be dismissed because petitioner has not shown that it
has standing to seek review of the rule amendments.
1. Relying upon the declaration of one of its officers (Petitioner’s
Addendum at A-48), petitioner states (Br. 4) that at least 30 of its members and
their subsidiaries (out of its more than 3 million members) are fund advisers, and
that these “include firms that have boards with management chairs and fewer than
75 percent independent directors.” 3/ But petitioner has not provided evidence
that any of those members has been injured by the rule amendments, much less
any evidence of “concrete and particularized” harm that is “actual or imminent, not
conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560
3/

We assume petitioner intended to say that the member firms advise “funds”
that have management chairs and fewer than 75 percent independent
directors.
4

(1992). 4/ Petitioner provides no evidence that any of its members would even
contend that they have been injured by the rule amendments. Nor has petitioner
identified any of its fund adviser members so as to permit inquiry into whether
they have been harmed. Petitioner apparently believes that it is sufficient for it
simply to allege harm to fund advisers generally. It is not. This Court requires a
petitioner whose standing is not self-evident to establish its standing, at the latest,
in its opening brief. Its burden of production in this Court is the same as that of a
plaintiff moving for summary judgment in the district court: it must support each
element of its claim to standing by affidavit or other evidence. Sierra Club v.
EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002). 5/ But petitioner provided no such
evidence of any actual harm to any of petitioner’s individual fund adviser
members. As far as we know, petitioner’s fund adviser members may, unlike
petitioner but like many other fund advisers, fully support the rule amendments.
Or, the funds advised by petitioner’s members may be among those that do not

4/

The Supreme Court has said that the “actual injury” requirement “tends to
assure that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved, not in
the rarified atmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual
context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial
action.” Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982).

5/

Petitioner was reminded of this obligation in the Court’s scheduling order

5

rely upon any of the Exemptive Rules and are, therefore, unaffected by the
amendments. Without the declaration of a single fund adviser member explaining
how it has been injured, petitioner has not established its associational standing.
Even petitioner’s claims of harm to fund advisers generally is without
adequate support. Petitioner claims (Br. 5) that management-chaired funds
perform better than independent-chaired funds, and that this will result in reduced
fees for fund advisers, thus causing them injury. But petitioner provides no
evidence of any such injury. Instead, petitioner points solely to a report prepared
by two fund industry consultants, Geoffrey H. Bobroff and Thomas H. Mack (the
“Bobroff-Mack Report”), that was commissioned in response to the proposed rule
amendments by one of the commenters (R2: Letter 65) opposed to the rule
amendments. 6/ That report, however, does not establish that the independence of
a fund’s chair is the reason for any lesser performance. 7/ Moreover, the report

6/

The report addressed only the condition that a fund have an independent
chair, not the condition that a fund board be 75 percent independent. As to
the latter condition, the Commission noted in the 2004 Adopting Release
that nearly 60 percent of all funds already meet this condition. 69 FR at
46387 n.78.

7/

As the Commission pointed out in the 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR 46383
n.52 (and as more fully discussed infra at 54-57), the report is equivocal in
its conclusions, and was criticized by other knowledgeable commenters.
Even if the report’s conclusions are accepted, at best they show that the
(continued...)
6

says nothing about the performance of funds in the future, nothing about adviser
fees being reduced as a result of the amendments and, most importantly, nothing
about any effect on petitioner’s individual members, but only that in the past some
independently chaired funds as a group may have performed somewhat less well
than some management chaired funds as a group.
Petitioner has not shown that any of its members will suffer “concrete and
particularized” harm that is “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”
as a result of the rule amendments. There is no evidence that is specific to one or
more of petitioner’s members that the performance of the funds they advise will
suffer as a result of the amendments, and that they will be harmed thereby. At a
minimum, petitioner should have provided declarations from its members
themselves demonstrating the probability of “substantial” injury to them. DEK
Energy Co. v. FERC, 248 F.3d 1192, 1195 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Petitioner has not
established its associational standing.
2. Petitioner also argues that it has standing in its own right as an investor
in funds. The rule amendments, it argues (Br. 5-6), will “compel” funds to comply
7/

small number of existing independent-chaired funds performed somewhat
less well during the past ten years than the much more common
management-chaired funds. The report offers no explanation for this
alleged discrepancy, calling it “an interesting and challenging question.”

with the new conditions and thus deprive petitioner of the ability to purchase a
desired product, namely a management-chaired fund. Petitioner apparently
believes that management-chaired funds will yield higher investment returns than
independent-chaired funds. But the amendments do not, as petitioner contends,
compel funds to be independently chaired. Only funds that seek to rely upon the
exemptions provided in the Exemptive Rules need comply. 8/ Moreover, whether
funds that comply with the independent chair condition will, in fact, have lower
investment returns than they otherwise would have had is pure conjecture.
Petitioner’s assertion of injury is not “distinct and palpable,” but “merely
hypothetical, abstract, or conjectural.” University Medical Center of Southern
Nevada v. Shalala, 173 F.3d 438, 441 (D.C. Cir. 1999). As this Court pointed out
in DEK Energy Co. v. FERC, 248 F.3d at 1195: “There is quite a gulf between the
antipodes of standing doctrine – the ‘imminent’ injury that suffices and the merely
‘conjectural’ one that does not. We have insisted that to escape the latter
characterization the claimant must show a substantial (if unquantifiable)
probability of injury.”
Petitioner has not made the required showing. As one commenter, John A.

8/

Funds also can continue to seek individual exemptions without reliance
upon the Exemptive Rules.
8

Hill, the independent chair of the Putnam fund group, pointed out (R2: Letter
171), there is “no dissimilarity of interest * * * between affiliated and independent
chairpersons” on the issue of fund performance. He said: “The role of board
chairpersons of large complexes is not to manage funds; portfolio managers
manage funds. The role of board chairpersons is to insure that his or her board
monitors performance and to insist on changes in personnel or strategy when
performance lags.” Petitioner has offered no credible support for its contention
that conditioning reliance on the Exemptive Rules upon an independent chair will
adversely affect fund performance. 9/ Indeed, petitioner has presented no
evidence that any fund in which it wishes to invest has indicated or would contend
that the rule amendments will impair its returns or its operations in any way.
B.

Aside From Standing, This Court Has Jurisdiction to Consider the
Petition.

Where, as here, the governing statute provides for appellate court
jurisdiction over appeals of agency “orders,” 10/ the courts of appeals possess

9/

Petitioner again cites the Bobroff-Mack Report, but the report does not
speak to the effect of the independent chair condition on the performance of
funds in the future, when all funds that wish to rely upon the Exemptive
Rules will have independent chairs. The report provides no basis to believe
that funds’ future performance will be affected at all.

When appellate court review can be conducted on the administrative record,

Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to consider the petition for review, which
was timely filed.
COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES
1.

Whether, in exercising its authority under the Investment Company

Act to grant conditional exemptions from statutory prohibitions against conflictof-interest transactions, the Commission exceeded that authority when it amended
the conditions to ten Exemptive Rules to strengthen independent director
oversight of such transactions, which had long been a condition of the rules and is
critical to the Act’s corporate governance provisions.
2.

Whether the Commission, in light of a series of enforcement actions

involving self-dealing by fund managers that cost investors more than half a
billion dollars and reflected a serious breakdown in management controls, was
10

arbitrary and capricious when it determined to strengthen independent director
oversight of conflict-of-interest transactions permitted under the Exemptive Rules.
COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE
On July 27, 2004, the Commission adopted the challenged rule
amendments. These amendments add conditions to ten Exemptive Rules that
conditionally permit funds and their affiliates to engage in transactions or
arrangements that involve potentially serious conflicts of interest between the
funds and their managers, and which would otherwise be prohibited under the Act.
Congress gave the Commission authority to grant exemptions, “conditionally or
unconditionally * * * to the extent that such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Act].” 11/
The Exemptive Rules have long been conditioned upon the judgment and scrutiny
of the funds’ independent directors to oversee these conflicts of interest. 12/ The

Section 6(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-6(c). See also Sections 10(f), 12(b),
17(d), 17(g), and 23(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-10(f), 80a-12(b), 80a17(d), 80a-17(g), and 80a-23(c).

12/

The term “independent,” as used in this brief and in the Commission’s
release adopting the amendments, describes a director who is not an
“interested person” of the fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Act,
15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(19). Interested persons of a fund include, among others,
(continued...)
11

challenged amendments strengthen this independent oversight by increasing the
percentage of independent directors of a fund that seeks to rely on the Exemptive
Rules from a simple majority to 75 percent, and by imposing the condition that the
board have an independent chair. 13/ The ten Exemptive Rules are summarized in
Respondent’s Statutory Addendum, attached hereto, at A5. A discussion of the
events leading up to the adoption of the amendments is set forth in Argument I,
infra.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Under Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706, this
Court considers whether an order of the Commission is arbitrary, capricious, an
abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to
constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of statutory
jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; or without
observance of procedure required by law. See AT&T Corp. v. FCC, 236 F.3d 729,
734-735 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Under Section 43(a) of the Investment Company Act,

12/

(...continued)
the fund’s investment adviser and its affiliated persons, such as its officers,
directors, and employees, and members of their immediate families.

13/

Until January 16, 2006, funds may continue to rely on the Exemptive Rules
without complying with these new conditions.
12

15 U.S.C. 80a-42(a), no objection to the order of the Commission shall be
considered by the Court unless such objection shall have been urged before the
Commission or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The
Commission’s findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.
See Graham v. SEC, 222 F.3d 994, 999-1000 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Schoenbohm v.
FCC, 204 F.3d 243, 246 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“possibility of drawing two inconsistent
conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency’s finding
from being supported by substantial evidence”).
The Commission’s conclusions of law with respect to the statutes it
administers are “binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or
capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.” United States v.
Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 227 (2001), citing Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984). The
Commission’s interpretation of a statute it administers is entitled to deference
under Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43. As discussed infra at 35-36, petitioner’s
argument (Br. 25 n.9) that Chevron does not apply is without merit.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
1. The two conditions challenged by petitioner continue a long history of
Commission reliance on independent directors to oversee the conflicts of interest
13

between funds and fund management inherent in the transactions allowed under
the Exemptive Rules. Independent director oversight of conflicts of interest has
always been a critical aspect of the extensive corporate governance provisions of
the Act, and has long been a cornerstone of the Exemptive Rules. Indeed, the
Exemptive Rules have been conditioned upon independent director oversight since
the rules were adopted (or amended) at various times over the last 50 years. This
independent director oversight was enhanced in 2001, when the Exemptive Rules
were amended to include the condition that a majority of the fund’s board be
independent. In 2004, the majority independent director condition adopted in
2001 was expanded to the current 75 percent condition, and the independent
chairman condition was added, because the Commission concluded that, in light of
the scandals in the fund industry involving serious wrongdoing by fund managers,
the 2001 amendments had not gone far enough in addressing the need for
independent oversight of fund managers.
2. Petitioner’s argument that the Commission lacked the authority to adopt
the challenged conditions because they are related to corporate governance ignores
the statute and is without merit. The Commission is expressly authorized to grant
exemptions that are conditional and are consistent with the purposes of the Act. A
central objective of the Act is to impose a scheme of governance and oversight to
14

regulate conflicts of interest that, in Congress’ view, were not addressed
adequately by state law. By imposing the challenged conditions to the use of the
Exemptive Rules, the rule amendments strengthen independent director oversight
of conflict-of-interest transactions covered by the Exemptive Rules – transactions
that would otherwise be entirely prohibited by the Act. Conditioning the use of
the exemptions on independent director oversight, as enhanced by the rule
amendments, is entirely consistent with the purposes and structure of the Act. The
requirement of Section 10(a) of the Act that for all funds at least 40 percent of the
fund’s board be composed of independent directors does not prevent the
Commission from requiring a greater percentage of independent directors, or from
requiring an independent chair, as a condition to exemptive rules allowing funds
and their affiliates to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited by
the Act.
3. Petitioner’s argument that the Commission’s adoption of the two
conditions was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance
with law is likewise without merit. In adopting the rule amendments, the
Commission examined the relevant facts and articulated a detailed and rational
explanation for its action. In light of the scandals in the fund industry, the
Commission reasonably concluded that independent director oversight of the
15

conflict-of-interest transactions permitted under the Exemptive Rules needed to be
strengthened. The scandals vividly demonstrated the critical importance of
effective independent oversight of fund advisers and affiliates, oversight that had
been sorely lacking in the funds involved in the enforcement actions. Contrary to
petitioner’s argument, the Commission was not required – in considering the
effect of the rule amendments on efficiency, competition, and capital formation –
to conduct an empirical analysis of whether funds with independent chairs
performed better than funds with management chairs. The objective of the rule
amendments was to monitor more effectively conflicts of interest and better
protect investors. The Commission made a considered and rational policy
determination, of a judgmental and predictive nature, after examining widespread
evidence of misconduct harmful to investors, reviewing an extensive comment
file, and applying its broad regulatory expertise. Contrary to petitioner’s
argument, the Commission properly considered the costs of the two conditions,
responded to commenters who suggested that an independent board should be
allowed to pick whomever it wished to be chair, and considered the other major
alternatives.

16

ARGUMENT
I.

Consistent With Congress’ Reliance on Oversight by Independent
Directors, the Commission Has Long Relied Upon Independent
Directors to Monitor Conflicts of Interest Inherent in Transactions
Allowed Under the Exemptive Rules.
The Investment Company Act was enacted in 1940 to meet the crisis of

confidence occasioned by scandals in the investment company industry which
were disclosed in public hearings leading to, and described in, the Report of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Investment Trusts and Investment
Companies (1939). Congress found that the disclosure regimes of the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were inadequate to cope
with the type of conflicts and abuses that then pervaded the investment company
industry. See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 2639, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 10 (1940). The Act,
with its detailed prescriptions for the organization and governance of investment
companies – particularly the setting of standards for independent directors, and
their role as “watchdogs” for the interests of fund shareholders, subject to
Commission oversight – played a crucial role in restoring confidence in
investment companies as a regulated medium for investor savings. See H.R. Rep.
No. 2639, supra, and the discussion by Judge Herlands in Brown v. Bullock, 194
F. Supp. 207, 244-45 (S.D.N.Y. 1961), aff’d 294 F.2d 415 (2d Cir. 1961). The

17

two conditions challenged by petitioner continue a long history of Commission
reliance on independent directors to oversee the conflicts of interest between funds
and fund management inherent in the transactions allowed under the Exemptive
Rules, consistent with the oversight role that was assigned to the independent
directors by Congress under the Act.
A.

Managing Conflicts of Interest – the Role of Independent Directors
1.

The Unique Structure of Mutual Funds

The critical role of independent directors of investment companies is
necessitated, in part, by the unique structure of investment companies. As the
Commission explained in the release proposing the 2001 amendments, 14/ funds
are formed as corporations or business trusts under state law and, like other
corporations and trusts, must be operated for the benefit of their shareholders.
Funds are unique, however, in that they are organized and operated by people
whose primary loyalty and pecuniary interest lie outside the enterprise. This
“external management” structure presents inherent conflicts of interest and
potential for abuses. An investment adviser typically organizes a fund and is
responsible for its day-to-day operations. The adviser generally provides the seed
14/

See Role of Independent Directors of Investment Companies, Investment
Company Act Release No. 24082 (Oct. 14, 1999) [64 FR 59826 (Nov. 3,
1999)] (“2001 Proposing Release”), at 59827.
18

money, officers, employees, and office space, and usually selects the initial board
of directors. As a result of this extensive involvement, investment advisers
typically have dominated the funds they advise.
Investment advisers to funds may have an interest that is quite different
from the interests of the funds’ shareholders. For example, while fund
shareholders ordinarily prefer lower advisory fees (to achieve greater fund
returns), the fund’s investment adviser might want to maximize its own profits
through higher fees. And while fund shareholders might prefer that advisers use
brokers that charge the lowest possible commissions, advisers might prefer to use
brokers that are affiliates of the adviser or that provide services to the adviser.
These types of conflicts (and others) resulted in the pervasive abuses that led
Congress in 1940 to enact legislation regulating the activities of mutual funds. As
noted by Professor Loss, the Investment Company Act “is definitely a regulatory
measure for an industry that was thought to require something more than the
disclosure treatment of the 1933 and 1934 Acts.” 1 L. Loss & J. Seligman,
Securities Regulation 242 (3d ed. rev. 1998).
2.

Statutory Curbs on Conflicts of Interest – the Role of
Independent Directors

One of the ways that the Act addresses conflicts between advisers and funds

19

is by giving fund boards, and in particular the independent directors, an important
oversight role. At the outset, in 1940, Congress required that for all funds at least
40 percent of the fund’s board be composed of independent directors. Section
10(a), 15 U.S.C. 80a-10(a). 15/ The Act further requires that a majority of a
fund’s independent directors: approve the fund’s contracts with its investment
adviser and principal underwriter; 16/ select the independent public accountant of
the fund; 17/ and select and nominate individuals to fill independent director
vacancies resulting from the assignment of an advisory contract. 18/
As the Supreme Court explained, Congress clearly intended independent
directors to be “watchdogs” safeguarding the interests of fund investors:
Congress’ purpose in structuring the Act as it did is clear. It
“was designed to place the unaffiliated directors in the role of
15/

Under certain circumstances, Congress provided for an even greater
percentage of independent directors. Section 10(b)(2), 15 U.S.C. 80a10(b)(2), requires, in effect, that independent directors comprise a majority
of a fund’s board if the fund’s principal underwriter is an affiliate of the
fund’s investment adviser; Section 15(f)(1), 15 U.S.C. 80a-15(f)(1), which
provides a safe harbor for the sale of an advisory business, requires that
directors who are independent of the adviser constitute at least 75 percent of
a fund board for at least three years following the assignment of the
advisory contract.

The Exemptive Rules Have Long Relied on Independent
Director Oversight.

Congress did not consider a 40 percent independent director requirement, or
even a majority, sufficient to protect investors against conflicts between advisers
and funds in all cases. Congress viewed the conflicts of interest inherent in the
transactions covered by the Exemptive Rules as being so serious that it imposed a
complete prohibition on those transactions. At the same time, however, Congress
gave the Commission broad authority in Section 6(c) of the Act to grant
exemptions by order or rule, “conditionally or unconditionally,” from these
prohibitions. 19/ In his remarks to Congress recommending the bill that later

became the Act, David Schenker, Chief Counsel of the Commission’s Investment
Trust Study and a principal author of the Act, explained that “the difficulty of
making provision for regulating an industry which has so many variants and so
many different types of activities * * * is precisely [the reason that Section 6(c)] is
inserted.” Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on S. 3580
Before a Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong.,
3d Sess. 197 (1940). 20/ The Commission has relied extensively on oversight by
independent directors in rules that exempt funds from various prohibitions under
the Act. Long before the ten Exemptive Rules were amended in 2001 to provide
for a majority independent board, reliance by a fund and its affiliates on any of the
ten rules was expressly conditioned upon the oversight of the independent
directors.
As the Exemptive Rules were adopted or amended at various times over a
period of five decades, each rule provided for independent director oversight. The
Commission explained that, because the adviser may have a “significant self-

conditioned upon approval of the independent directors “to ensure that the
interests of the investment companies and their shareholders * * * are not
compromised.” 21/ The Commission has pointed out that oversight by
independent directors is particularly important in the case of an exemptive rule
because, unlike in the case of an individual application for an exemption, the
Commission staff would no longer individually review the transactions exempted
under the rule. 22/ When it adopted Rule 12b-1, 17 CFR 270.12b-1, in 1980, the
Commission discussed the connection between greater oversight by independent
directors and reduced oversight by Commission staff. Citing a study then being
conducted, the Commission said: 23/
Two central goals of the Study are to permit investment
companies to exercise wider latitude in making business
judgments without Commission approval and to enhance
the role of directors, particularly the disinterested
directors, in scrutinizing investment company affairs.

Rule Amendments to Enhance the Effectiveness of Independent
Directors

2001 Amendments

The rule amendments challenged by petitioner were adopted as part of a
broad effort by the Commission over a number of years to better address conflicts
of interest between funds and their investment advisers or other affiliated
persons. 24/ In the late 1990's, questions were being raised about the effectiveness
of independent directors. The Commission also had instituted a number of
enforcement actions against independent directors for failing to fulfill their legal
obligations. 25/ In recognition of the increasingly important role that funds played

in Americans’ finances and that independent directors played in protecting fund
investors, the Commission hosted a two-day public Roundtable in 1999 to discuss
the role of independent directors and the steps that could be taken to improve their
effectiveness. 26/ Most participants agreed that independent directors could best
fulfill their responsibilities when they constitute “a substantial majority” of the
board. 27/
The recommendations of the Roundtable participants led the Commission to
review its Exemptive Rules – rules “that provide funds and advisers relief from
various statutory prohibitions designed to prevent the most egregious conflicts of
interest.” 2001 Proposing Release, 64 FR at 59829. The Commission stated:
[I]n light of the recommendations of the Roundtable

prohibited by the Act also should contain provisions designed

Id. The Commission said that it selected the ten Exemptive Rules for amendment
because those rules “(i) exempt funds or their affiliated persons from provisions of
the Act, and (ii) have as a condition the approval or oversight of independent
directors.” Id. Among the amendments proposed was the condition that
independent directors constitute a majority of the board of any fund that sought to

2004 Amendments

In July 2004, the majority independent director condition adopted in 2001
was expanded to the current 75 percent condition, and the independent chairman
condition was added. The Commission concluded that, in the wake of a troubling
series of ongoing enforcement actions, the 2001 amendments had not gone far
enough in addressing the need for independent oversight of fund managers. In
these enforcement actions (which involved fraudulent market timing activities,
illegal late trading of mutual fund shares, and misuse of nonpublic information
about fund portfolios), a significant number of well known fund advisers had
engaged in misconduct that cost investors more than $500 million – a figure that
has grown in subsequently concluded Commission enforcement actions by at least
an additional $750 million. The abuses also caused investors to withdraw assets
from funds because of their lost trust in the fund advisers. 30/ With respect to

market timing, fund advisers improperly reaped financial benefits (generally in the
form of increased fees) at the expense of fund shareholders. The advisers allowed
certain select investors to conduct frequent trading in fund shares, even though the
fund’s prospectus disclosure indicated that such trading would be discouraged or
even prohibited. In some cases, fund advisers expected – or even required –
these select investors to invest in other funds managed by the adviser, such as
other mutual funds or hedge funds. These quid pro quo arrangements benefitted
the advisers at the expense of ordinary fund investors. In some cases, advisers
offered an additional benefit to these select investors – nonpublic information
regarding the mutual fund’s portfolio holdings. Disclosure of this information,
ordinarily considered highly confidential, conferred an advantage on the select
investors, allowing them to profit from market timing during falling markets. 31/

The Commission found that this misconduct reflected a serious breakdown
in management controls in a number of large mutual fund complexes. The
Commission observed that in each case, the fund was used for the benefit of fund
managers rather than fund shareholders. 32/ The Commission further determined
that fund advisers were frequently in a position to dominate a fund’s board
because of the adviser’s monopoly over information about the fund and its
frequent ability to control the board’s agenda. Consequently, the Commission
questioned the ability of a management-dominated board to undertake the
oversight necessary to address conflicts of interest. 33/
Prior to adopting the 2004 amendments, the Commission received nearly
200 comments from fund investors, management companies, and independent
directors to funds, as well as members of Congress. Most commenters supported
the 75 percent condition. After considering the comments, the Commission found

Requiring that each fund that relies upon any Exemptive
Rule have a board of directors whose independent
directors constitute at least 75 percent of the board, will
help ensure that independent directors carry out their
fiduciary responsibilities. Management controls the dayto-day activities of the fund and has significantly greater
access to information about the fund than do the
independent directors. This information gives the
management directors a significant advantage over the
independent directors in setting the board’s agenda and
potentially dominating board deliberations. The
amendments seek to resolve this imbalance.
Commenters were divided on the independent chair proposal. Among those
strongly supporting the proposal were all of the seven living former Chairmen of
the Commission (R2: Letter 179). Upon consideration, the Commission
determined that a fund board would be in a better position to protect the interests
of the fund, and to fulfill the board’s obligations under the Act and the Exemptive
Rules, if its chairman did not have the conflicts of interest inherent in the role of
an executive of the fund adviser. 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR at 46382. The
Commission said (id. at 46383):
The board chairman can play an important role in setting the
agenda of the board, and in establishing a boardroom culture
that can foster the type of meaningful dialogue between fund
management and independent directors that is critical for
healthy fund governance. The chairman can play an important
role in providing a check on the adviser, in negotiating the best
deal for shareholders when considering the advisory contract,
and in providing leadership to the board that focuses on the
30

long-term interests of investors. We believe that a fund
chairman is in the best position to fulfill these responsibilities
when his loyalty is not divided between the fund and its
investment adviser.
The Commission noted that even with an independent chair, representatives of
management would still be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the fund,
and would continue to be able to serve as fund directors. “We do not believe that
this amendment will deprive the board of management’s knowledge and
judgment.” Id. at 46383.
In adopting these amendments, the Commission found that “if funds are to
engage in the transactions permitted by the Exemptive Rules, and effectively
manage the conflicts of interest inherent in those transactions, greater board
independence is needed.” Id. at 46279-80. The Commission also noted that the
rule amendments were part of a larger package of regulatory reforms “designed
both to prevent the compliance failures of yesterday and to strengthen a fund
board’s ability to deal with compliance challenges of the future.” Id. at 46384. 34/

34/

The Commission has proposed or adopted a range of other regulatory
reforms, including rules to require that funds adopt compliance policies and
procedures, disclose policies on market timing and selective disclosure of
portfolio information, and charge redemption fees for short-term trading in
fund shares. See 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR at 46378 n.5.

II.

The Rule Amendments Are Well Within the Commission’s Statutory
Authority.
A.

The Commission Has Express Authority to Adopt Rules Providing
Conditional Exemptions That Are Consistent With Statutory
Purposes; the Conditions Challenged By Petitioner Are Consistent
With the Purposes of the Investment Company Act.

The Commission has express authority under the Investment Company Act
to amend (as well as to adopt) exemptive rules that are consistent with the
purposes of the Act. The conditions imposed by the 2004 amendments, which are
challenged by petitioner, are indeed consistent with the Act’s purposes and should
be upheld.
Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission, “conditionally or
unconditionally,” to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any
provision of the Act “if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Act].” 35/
This provision, by its terms, contemplates an array of conditions designed to
ameliorate the fund management’s conflicts of interest in dealing with the fund
and its shareholders. The Act also gives general authority to the Commission to
35/

Other sections of the Investment Company Act provide similar exemptive
authority specific to those sections. See Sections 10(f), 12(b), 17(d), 17(g),
and 23(c).
32

make such rules as are necessary or appropriate to the exercise of the powers
conferred upon the Commission under the Act. Section 38(a), 15 U.S.C. 80a37(a). It is well settled that “the validity of a regulation promulgated” under an
agency’s enabling statute “will be sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably related to
the purposes of the enabling legislation.’” Mourning v. Family Publications Serv.,
Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973) (quoting Thorpe v. Housing Auth. of City of
Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 280-81 (1969)). See also Touche Ross & Co. v. SEC, 609
F.2d 570, 579-80 (2d Cir. 1979).
The purposes of the Act are clear. Section 1(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a1(a), sets out the reasons investment companies “are affected with a national
public interest,” and notes the necessity for broad federal regulation of investment
companies. The wide-ranging activities of investment companies “make difficult,
if not impossible, effective State regulation of such companies in the interest of
investors.” Section 1(a)(5). Section 1(a)(2) points to the importance of the
activities of investment companies as “constitut[ing] a substantial part of all
transactions effected in the securities markets of the Nation,” and Section 1(a)(4)
points out that investment companies “are media for the investment in the national
economy of a substantial part of the national savings and may have a vital effect

33

upon the flow of such savings into the capital markets.” These findings made by
Congress in 1940 are more true today than ever, with over $7.65 trillion in fund
assets and 53.8 million American households invested in funds.
Section 1(b)(2) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1(b)(2), states, among other
things, that the national public interest and the interest of investors are adversely
affected when investment companies are organized, operated, or managed in the
interest of investment advisers or their affiliated persons rather than in the interest
of their investors. And Section 1(b) specifically provides that the Act is to be
interpreted so as to mitigate or eliminate such abuses. The importance of this
language as a guide in the interpretation of the Act was stressed by Judge Friendly
in Brown v. Bullock, 294 F.2d 415, 421 (2d Cir. 1961). See also Levitt v. Johnson,
334 F.2d 815, 819 (1st Cir. 1964).
As discussed above, the two conditions challenged by petitioner were
adopted in order to strengthen oversight by independent directors of transactions
that would, absent the Exemptive Rules, be prohibited under the Act because of
serious conflicts of interest between funds and their management. Independent
director oversight of such conflicts of interest, which has long been employed by
the Commission under the Exemptive Rules, is entirely consistent with the
approach taken by Congress in the Act, as detailed in Argument I. In light of the
34

recent scandals in the fund industry, the Commission determined that there had
been a serious breakdown in the oversight of fund managers – oversight
necessitated by the conflicts of interest inherent in the “external management”
structure of funds. Because of this breakdown, it was reasonable for the
Commission to conclude, as it did, that the current level of independent director
oversight under the Exemptive Rules was not sufficient to monitor adequately the
conflicts of interest inherent in the transactions covered by those rules, and that it
needed to be improved. The adoption of the two new conditions represented a
reasonable response to the problem, consistent with the purpose of the Act to rely
on effective oversight by independent directors as a means of protecting funds and
fund investors from conflicts of interest. The rule amendments were well within
the Commission’s authority.
Even if the Act had left ambiguous the Commission’s authority to impose
the two challenged conditions, this Court should adhere to the interpretive
direction of Section 1(b) in upholding such authority. In addition, this Court
should defer to the Commission’s interpretation of the Act under Chevron.
Petitioner incorrectly argues (Br. 25 n.9) that Chevron deference is inappropriate
when the scope of the agency’s jurisdiction is at issue. The Supreme Court has
squarely held that Chevron deference applies to agencies’ interpretations of the
35

statutes they administer, including those that implicate the agencies’ jurisdiction.
See, e.g., CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 844 (1986); NLRB v. City Disposal
Systems Inc., 465 U.S. 822, 829-30 & n.7 (1984). See also Mississippi Power &
Light Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Moore, 487 U.S. 354, 381 (1988) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in the judgment) (giving deference to an agency’s interpretation of its
statutory authority is necessary because “there is no discernible line between an
agency’s exceeding its authority and an agency’s exceeding authorized application
of its authority. To exceed authorized application is to exceed authority.”). 36/
B.

Contrary to Petitioner’s Contentions, Conditioning the Exemptive
Rules on Independent Director Oversight Is Consistent With the
Structure of the Act.

In spite of the Commission’s express authority to grant conditional
exemptions, petitioner argues (Br. 26-27) that the Commission lacked the
authority to adopt the 75 percent independent board condition and the independent
chair condition because they are related to corporate governance, which, petitioner
argues, is the domain of state law. Of course, funds, like other corporations, are
incorporated pursuant to state, not federal, law. But this does not mean that
36/

In Business Roundtable v. SEC, 905 F.2d 406, 408 (D.C. Cir. 1990), this
Court stated, “we assume that we owe the Commission deference under
[Chevron], even though the case might be characterized as involving a limit
on the SEC’s jurisdiction.” See also Mitchell v. Christopher, 996 F.2d 375,
379 (D.C. Cir. 1993).
36

federal law imposes no requirements on the corporate governance of funds. While
the Act “does not purport to be the source of authority for [a fund’s] managerial
power,” the Act nonetheless “functions primarily to ‘impos[e] controls and
restrictions on the internal management of investment companies.’” Burks v.
Lasker, 441 U.S. at 478 (citation omitted, emphasis in original). As we have seen,
those controls and restrictions include giving to the independent directors “a host
of special responsibilities involving supervision of management.” Id. at 483. This
plainly relates to corporate governance, particularly in the case of dealing with
conflicts of interest as the Commission has done in the Exemptive Rules. A
central objective of the Act is to impose a scheme of governance and oversight to
regulate conflicts of interest that, in Congress’ view, were not addressed
adequately by state law.
Nevertheless, petitioner maintains (Br. 28) that the Act “contains no
indication that the Commission was licensed to exceed its customary role and
undertake the regulation of mutual fund governance.” But this ignores that the
Commission was expressly authorized to grant conditional exemptions, and that
the conditions imposed by the rule amendments are reasonably designed to further
the purposes of the Act and to protect investors. Nothing in the language of the
statute or the legislative history suggests that Congress intended for the
37

permissible conditions to exclude conditions related to the oversight of the
independent directors. To the contrary, as the Supreme Court said in Burks v.
Lasker, 441 U.S. at 484-85, “the structure and purpose of the [Act] indicate that
Congress entrusted to the independent directors of investment companies,
exercising the authority granted to them by state law, the primary responsibility for
looking after the interests of the funds’ shareholders.” Because Congress itself
relied extensively on independent director oversight under the Act, it is entirely
rational to construe the authority delegated by Congress to the Commission under
the Act to include the authority to condition exemptions upon independent director
oversight – authority the Commission has exercised for decades.
If petitioner’s argument to the contrary were correct, the Commission would
never be able to grant exemptions that relied upon the oversight of independent
directors because to do so would infringe on a fund’s corporate governance. Not
only would the 75 percent independent board and independent chair conditions go
out the window, so would the majority independent board condition adopted in
2001, and even the decades-old condition of separate approval by the independent
directors. Instead, the Commission would be required either to review
individually requests for exemptions for specific transactions, or to impose
detailed and strict guidelines applicable to each category of prohibited
38

transactions. Contrary to petitioner’s contention, this is not an approach mandated
by Congress, but an approach Congress sought to avoid.
Petitioner next argues that the requirement of Section 10(a) that at least 40
percent of a fund’s board be composed of independent directors somehow
forecloses the possibility of requiring a greater percentage of independent
directors, or of requiring an independent chair, as a condition to a fund’s relying
on an Exemptive Rule (Br. 28). In fact, petitioner claims (Br. 30, emphasis added)
that the “Act’s provision that 40 percent of a fund’s directors be independent of
management embodies a considered congressional decision to reject” a greater
percentage, even in the case of an exemption for transactions the Act would
otherwise prohibit. This is wholly unsupported and incorrect. There is nothing in
the Act or the legislative history to indicate that the Commission could not require
a higher percentage as a condition to an exemption where necessary or
appropriate. Petitioner’s argument fails to distinguish between the statutory
requirements applicable to all funds, and the conditions for reliance upon the
Exemptive Rules, which apply only to those funds that choose to rely upon those
rules. Regardless of whether the Commission may lack authority to alter the
former, nothing in the language of the statute suggests it lacks the authority to
impose the latter, so long as they are reasonably related to the Act’s purposes.
39

Petitioner cites (Br. 29) to the testimony of David Schenker, Chief Counsel
of the Commission’s Investment Trust Study. But while Mr. Schenker explained
that a majority independent director provision in the original Senate bill had been
reduced to 40 percent because of concerns that an independent majority could
repudiate the recommendations of the investment adviser, he went on to say (in
discussing the requirement of Section 10(b) of the Act that a majority of the
directors be independent if the fund’s principal underwriter is an affiliate of the
fund’s adviser):
You come to a different situation which is dealt with in subsection
(b). However, the bill provides that if you have a pecuniary interest
more direct than that of merely a manager who gets a fee; if you have
a pecuniary interest in the transactions in which the investment
company effects and have the power to make these transactions, then
you have to give up control of the board.
Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on H.R. 10065 Before the
House Subcomm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 110
(1940). This is precisely what happens in the case of transactions covered by the
Exemptive Rules. The conflicts of interest inherent in those transactions indeed
involve pecuniary interests beyond the adviser’s advisory fee. In fact, the conflicts
are so serious the transactions would, absent an exemption, be absolutely
prohibited. It is entirely appropriate to condition such transactions on effective

40

independent oversight.
Petitioner also appears to maintain that the Commission lacked authority to
impose the two conditions because the Commission’s motivation was improper,
that the Commission sought not to enhance independent director oversight under
the ten Exemptive Rules, but rather to mandate broadly independent control of
funds generally. Any such contention is without merit. The Commission made it
clear that although it “urge[d] all funds to consider adopting the measures to
strengthen the independence of their boards, funds that do not rely on any of the
Exemptive Rules will not be subject to these requirements.” Adopting Release, 69
FR at 46379 n.12. While the Commission clearly believed (and desired) that the
amendments would have salutary effects beyond the oversight of the conflicts
involved in the ten Exemptive Rules, the amendments were “designed to enhance
the ability of fund boards to perform their important responsibilities under each of
the rules.” Id. at 46379 (emphasis added). As long as the amendments were
reasonably related to the purposes of the Act, which they unquestionably were, the
Commission had authority to act.
C.

Petitioner’s Reliance on Case Law Is Misplaced.

The situation here is in sharp contrast to the situation presented in Business
Roundtable v. SEC, 905 F.2d 406, cited by petitioner (Br. 32). There, this Court
41

determined that a rule adopted by the Commission, which barred securities
exchanges from listing stock of a corporation that reduces per share voting rights,
was beyond the Commission’s authority. This was because the Court determined,
905 F.2d at 408, that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.,
could not “be understood to include regulation of an issue that is so far beyond
matters of disclosure [by issuers] * * * and of the management and practices of
self-regulatory organizations [such as exchanges].” Instead, the effect of the rule
was to regulate the management and practices of issuers, even though for issuers
Congress’ central concern in the Exchange Act was disclosure. Id. at 410. While
the Exchange Act allowed the Commission to regulate the administration and
operation of the self-regulatory organizations, it could not regulate “the issuers’
corporate structures.” Id. at 413. In marked contrast, the Investment Company
Act directly regulates the management and practices, including aspects of the
corporate governance, of funds, and assigns a specific role to the independent
directors. “Unlike other federal securities laws, which are designed to protect
investors primarily through disclosure, the Act imposes substantive requirements
on the operations of investment companies in addition to disclosure requirements.”
Thomas P. Lemke, Gerald T. Lins, A. Thomas Smith, Regulation of Investment
Companies (2004). Moreover, the Act expressly delegates authority to the
42

Commission to grant exemptions subject to conditions, provided that the
exemptions are conditioned so as to be in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes of the Act. The Commission’s
imposition of “controls and restrictions” on the operations of a fund’s board as a
condition to a fund’s reliance on the Exemptive Rules is entirely within the
regulatory scheme of the Investment Company Act. See Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S.
at 478.
The other cases cited by petitioner (Br. 32-33) are equally unavailing. In
Teicher v. SEC, 177 F.3d 1016 (D.C. Cir. 1999), the Court determined that the
Commission could not use its authority under the Exchange Act, which allowed it
to “place limitations” upon the activities of a person associated with a brokerdealer, to bar that person from association with an investment adviser. This was
because the Exchange Act expressly allowed the Commission to bar a person
associated with a broker-dealer from future association with a broker or dealer,
while the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80b-3(f), expressly allowed
the Commission to bar a person associated with an investment adviser from future
association with an investment adviser. This suggested that Congress intended
there to be a nexus between the securities activity with which the person was
associated and the securities activity from which the Commission was authorized
43

to bar him. Here, there is an obvious nexus between the two conditions
challenged by petitioner, which enhance independent oversight of otherwise
prohibited conflict-of-interest transactions, and the purpose of the Investment
Company Act of protecting funds and fund investors from conflicts of interest.
In American Bankers Ass’n v. SEC, 804 F.2d 739 (D.C. Cir. 1986), this
Court vacated a Commission rule that required banks engaging in the securities
brokerage business to register as broker-dealers under the Exchange Act, even
though the Exchange Act “unambiguously” excluded banks from broker-dealer
regulation. Although the Commission rule sought to redefine “bank” such that
banks engaged in the brokerage business could be regulated, the Court found (804
F.2d at 755) that the statutory definition was “plain as can be” and reflected a
basic decision by Congress on how to allocate regulatory responsibility that could
not be changed except by Congress. Here, in contrast, there is no claim that the
rule amendments conflict with the plain language of the statute. In fact, they are
entirely consistent with that language. 37/

37/

In Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. Dep’t of Labor, 174 F.3d
206 (D.C. Cir. 1999), also cited by petitioner (Br. 33), this Court held that
OSHA was required to conduct notice and comment rulemaking before
imposing safety and health standards which employers were required to
meet in order to avoid costly and inconvenient OSHA inspections. Here, of
course, the Commission did conduct notice and comment rulemaking.

III.

The Commission Articulated a Satisfactory Explanation for the Rule
Amendments; The Rational Connection Between the Facts Found and
the Choices Made Cannot Be Doubted.
Petitioner argues (Br. 34-35) that the Commission’s adoption of the two

conditions was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance
with law.” As the Supreme Court has explained, the scope of review under the
“arbitrary and capricious” standard is narrow and this Court is not to substitute its
judgment for that of the Commission. Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass’n v. State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). Nevertheless,
the Commission was required to examine the relevant data and articulate a
satisfactory explanation for its action including a “rational connection between the
facts found and the choice made.” Id. (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.
United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962). In reviewing that explanation, the Court
must “consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant
factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.” Id. (quoting
Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285
(1974); Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971).
Normally, an agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the agency has
relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to
consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its
45

decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible
that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency
expertise. Id. As more fully discussed below, in adopting the rule amendments,
the Commission indeed examined the relevant facts and properly articulated a
detailed and rational explanation for its action.
A.

The Commission Fully Explained Its Rationale for Amending the
Exemptive Rules.

Petitioner argues (Br. 35-39) that the Commission failed to articulate a
cogent explanation for its actions. Apparently, rather than dealing with the
Exemptive Rules as a group, petitioner would have the Commission address each
rule individually. But the Commission explained in connection with the 2001
amendments and again in connection with the 2004 amendments why it was
appropriate to amend these particular rules. The ten rules were selected because
each of them (i) exempted funds from provisions of the Act that prohibit certain
conflict-of-interest transactions, and (ii) had as a condition the approval or
oversight of independent directors. 38/ The Commission explained: “These rules
rely on the independent judgment and scrutiny of directors, including independent
directors, in overseeing activities that are beneficial to funds and fund
38/

2001 Proposing Release, 64 FR at 59829. In fact, the Commission
requested comment on the criteria it used to select the ten rules. Id.
46

shareholders but that involve conflicts of interest between the funds and their
managers.” 39/ Because the scandals in the fund industry involved serious
conflicts of interest in which fund managers benefitted at the expense of the fund
investors, the need for greater scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, including
those covered by the Exemptive Rules, was obvious. There was no need for the
Commission to discuss, yet again, the reasons why independent director oversight
was an essential condition for each individual rule. Rather, the Commission
appropriately discussed why independent director oversight needed to be
enhanced and how the rule amendments would further that objective.
Petitioner focuses (Br. 36-38) on two of the Exemptive Rules, Rules 17g1(j) and 15a-4(b)(2), and complains that the Commission did not explain why the
amendments were necessary “in light of the exemption’s longstanding requirement
that the [transaction] be approved by a majority of independent directors.” 40/ In
fact, the Commission explained, both in connection with the 2001 amendments
and again in connection with the 2004 amendments, that serious problems had
emerged in the mutual fund industry, indicating that the independent oversight

39/

40/

Under petitioner’s theory, as discussed above, the Commission lacked the
authority to impose even this condition.
47

conditions provided in the Exemptive Rules needed to be strengthened. In 2001,
the Commission had added the condition that a majority of the board be
independent, but that change proved to be inadequate. So, in 2004, the
Commission further strengthened the conditions for independent oversight by
adopting the 75 percent condition and the independent chair condition. “[A]n
agency must be given ample latitude to ‘adapt their rules and policies to the
demands of changing circumstances.’” Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass’n v.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. at 42 (quoting Permian
Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 784 (1968)). 41/
Next, petitioner complains (Br. 38) that the Commission “failed to establish
a connection between the problems that it claimed justified the rulemaking, and
the actual terms of the rule,” and that there is no relationship between the scandals

41/

Petitioner argues more specifically (Br. 37) that there is no connection
between the ability of an independent chair to set the board’s agenda, which
was cited by the Commission as a benefit of the independent chair
condition, and an Exemptive Rule that already requires board consideration
of a transaction. As the Commission explained, however, control of the
agenda by a management chair, among other things, “may contribute to the
adviser’s ability to dominate the actions of the board of directors.” 2004
Proposing Release, 69 FR at 3474. The objective of having an independent
chair is not to assure that transactions covered by the Exemptive Rules get
on the board’s agenda, but to assure that the independent directors are able
to effectively exercise their oversight truly independently of, and not
dominated by, management.
48

involving late trading, market timing, and misuse of nonpublic information, and
the transactions for which exemptions are provided under the Exemptive Rules.
Of course there is a relationship. Independent directors are supposed to play the
role of independent watchdogs who furnish an independent check upon the fund
management. Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. at 484. These scandals, the Commission
found, reflected a serious breakdown in controls over the conflicts of interest
between funds and their managers that are inherent in the external management
structure of funds – the same sort of conflicts that led Congress to prohibit the
transactions covered by the Exemptive Rules. The watchdogs (or at least some of
them), it appears, were asleep or, worse, were awake but chose not to bark. Since
independent director oversight of fund managers in the areas involved in the
scandals had proved ineffective, it was reasonable for the Commission to conclude
that independent director oversight of fund managers under the Exemptive Rules
should be strengthened. The Commission explained both in the 2004 Proposing
Release, 69 FR at 3472, and in the 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR at 46378-79,
that, in light of the scandals, the amendments were necessary and appropriate to
“provide for greater fund board independence and are designed to enhance the
ability of fund boards to perform their important responsibilities under each of the
[Exemptive Rules].” The Commission concluded in the 2004 Adopting Release,
49

69 FR at 46379-80 (footnote omitted): “We recognize that these amendments
might not have prevented all of the abuses that were uncovered in the enforcement
actions discussed above. Nevertheless, if funds are to engage in the transactions
permitted by the Exemptive Rules and effectively manage the conflicts of interest
inherent in those transactions, greater board independence is needed.” 42/
Finally, petitioner makes the remarkable claim (Br. 34, 39) that the
requirement in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-447,
118 Stat. 2809 (2004), that the Commission submit a report to the Senate
Appropriations Committee, constitutes a “congressional determination that the
Commission failed to satisfy its obligation under the APA” to justify the
independent chair condition. Congress made no such determination – it simply

42/

Petitioner also claims (Br. 38) that there was insufficient “record evidence”
to support the rule amendments. As more fully discussed infra at __, the
Commission was required, in addressing the effectiveness of independent
director oversight, to use its judgment to predict how funds would react to
the new conditions imposed by the rule amendments. The Commission
relied on an extensive comment file, as well as its own experience and
expertise. “[A] forecast of the direction in which future public interest lies
necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the
agency.” FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, 436 U.S. 775,
813 (1978) (quoting FPC v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 365
U.S. 1, 29 (1961); Melcher v. FCC, 134 F.3d 1143, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1998).
Petitioner also cites (Br. 38) to a “recent academic study” that was not
before the Commission and is not part of the record in this case. It cannot
be considered by this Court. See Section 43(a).
50

asked for a report. The appropriation for the Commission included in the bill
contains a provision directing the Commission, not later than May 1, 2005, to
submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate that provides a
justification for the independent chair condition. The report is to include an
analysis of whether mutual funds chaired by disinterested directors perform better,
have lower expenses, or have better compliance records than mutual funds chaired
by interested directors. The Commission is directed to act upon the
recommendations of the report not later than January 1, 2006. What conclusions,
if any, Congress or the Senate committee draws from the report remains to be
seen. If Congress had wished to nullify the Commission’s action, it easily could
have done so.
B.

The Commission Properly Considered Whether the Rule
Amendments Would Promote Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation.

Section 2(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-2(c), requires the Commission, when
engaging in rulemaking that requires it to consider or determine whether an action
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to also consider whether the
action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The
Commission specifically considered this in Section VIII of the 2004 Adopting
Release, “Consideration of Promotion of Efficiency, Competition and Capital
51

Formation,” 69 FR at 46388-89. The Commission said that it did not expect the
amendments to have a significant effect on efficiency, competition and capital
formation because the costs associated with the amendments were minimal and
many funds had already adopted the required practices. To the extent that these
amendments did affect competition or capital formation, the Commission said it
believed that the effect would be positive because the amendments were likely to
reduce the risk of securities law violations such as late trading in mutual funds and
market timing violations, and thus increase investor confidence in mutual funds.
In the 2004 Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comments on the impact
of the proposed amendments on efficiency, competition and capital formation, but
did not receive any from petitioner or any other commenter.
Nevertheless, petitioner now argues (Br. 40-42) that the Commission did not
adequately consider the effect of the rule amendments on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation, because it did not conduct an empirical analysis of whether
funds with independent chairs performed better than funds with management
chairs. 43/ But there is nothing in the statute that requires an empirical study to

Petitioner contends (Br. 40) that the Commission staff failed to conduct a
study although requested to do so by Commissioner Glassman. In fact, at
the Commission meeting adopting the amendments, the Commission’s
Deputy Chief Economist explained that his office had in fact analyzed the

52

demonstrate that a particular action will, in fact, promote efficiency, competition,
and capital formation. Section 2(c) required the Commission to consider whether
the rule amendments would promote efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. The Commission did just that. The primary objectives of the rule
amendments were to monitor more effectively conflicts of interest and better
protect investors. To the extent that factual determinations were involved in the
Commission’s decision to adopt the new conditions, “they were primarily of a
judgmental or predictive nature.” FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for
Broadcasting, 436 U.S. 775, 813 (1978). “In such circumstances complete factual
support in the record for the Commission’s judgment or prediction is not possible
or required; ‘a forecast of the direction in which future public interest lies
necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the agency.’”
Id. (quoting FPC v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 365 U.S. 1, 29 (1961).
In Melcher v. FCC, 134 F.3d 1143, this Court considered an FCC decision
to bar rural telephone companies from holding licenses for wireless service in the
same geographic area in which they provide telephone service if there was more
43/

(...continued)
issue, but that it had ceased work when it determined that it was not finding
anything new and because the evidence it had found was “mixed” and
“inconclusive,” and “there is a limited ability to measure” the costs and the
benefits. R4:30-36.
53

than a 10 percent overlap of customers. Among other things, the FCC found that
the restriction would not hinder the introduction of the wireless service in rural
areas because there was unlikely to be that much overlap between the area served
by a rural phone company and the area likely to be served by the wireless service.
The rural phone companies argued that the FCC was required to “conduct an
analysis of the actual degree of overlap between [wireless service] areas and rural
telephone company service areas.” Id. at 1158. This Court said that the FCC
might profitably have undertaken such a factual investigation, but that it was not
required to do so. “[W]e do not believe that the comprehensive factual analysis
that the rural [phone companies] would have liked was actually required of the
FCC in this case. The FCC was entitled to conduct, and did conduct, a general
analysis based on informed conjecture. * * * The FCC accordingly drew a
reasonable inference from its general knowledge * * *.” Id.
Petitioner also contends (Br. 41) that the Commission failed to consider the
Bobroff-Mack Report, discussed above, even though, according to petitioner, it
showed that management-chaired funds outperformed independent-chaired funds.
In fact, the Commission did consider the report in the 2004 Adopting Release, 69
FR at 46383 n.52, but did not find it compelling. The report did not purport to
discuss the future impact, if any, of the independent chair condition on fund
54

performance. With respect to past performance, the report was equivocal in its
conclusion, stating (p. 4): “Why independent chair funds have performed less well
than management chair funds is an interesting and challenging question. Apart
from having different types of board chairs, the two groups of funds have other
important differences that may have impacted performance results.” 44/ As the
Commission pointed out in the 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR 46383 n.52, another
commenter, using the same data as the Bobroff-Mack Report, found that the

44/

The report explains some of these differences (p. 4-5):
The independent chair fund groups are mostly bank-based,
sales force oriented fund groups, which distribute their funds
importantly through the banks’ own trust departments and
brokerage arms. In contrast, the management chair fund groups
are mostly so-called “wholesale” firms: sales force oriented
groups that sell mainly through third-party broker-dealers and
other distributors. It is possible that differences in the types of
clients served (for example, being more or less conservative) or
other distribution-related factors could have influenced
performance results. * * * [W]e have focused on the larger
fund groups, and the independent chair funds and fund groups
tend to be smaller than the other firms. * * * Therefore, as it
happens the independent chair firms are being compared
against mostly larger firms, which by definition have been
more successful in asset gathering, which may be because they
have produced particularly good investment performance.
The report also pointed out (p. 11) that it had been prepared under
“significant time restraints,” which “limited the possibilities for further
analysis.”
55

independent-chaired funds performed slightly better than management-chaired
funds (R2: Letter 175). That commenter, John C. Bogle, the founder and former
CEO of The Vanguard Group, believed (p. 13) that the Bobroff-Mack Report had
mis-categorized some funds as independent chair when they should have been
categorized as management chair. 45/ After correcting what he thought were miscategorizations, and expanding the categories being compared from two to four,
Bogle found (p. 14) that “management-chaired funds and bank-managed funds
ranked at the bottom * * *. 46/ Independently-chaired funds did only slightly
better in terms of returns, but at lower cost.” Another commenter, John A. Hill,
warned (R2: Letter 171) that “[s]tudies purporting to show that funds with
affiliated chairpersons have better investment results are statistically flawed: there
are too few funds with independent chairs (less than 1%) and the time frames
selected for comparison are too limited to permit any statistically significant

45/

One of the poorest performing fund groups, Bogle said (p. 13), had been put
in the independent chair group in the Bobroff-Mack Report even though the
chairmen during the time period had been the former head of the fund’s
management company and a former senior executive of the conglomerate
that owned the management company.

46/

Bogle compared non-bank funds having independent chairs, bank-managed
funds having independent chairs, funds having management chairs, and
funds operated under mutualized structures where the fund chair was
affiliated with the fund’s administrator but not with the fund’s investment
adviser.
56

comparisons on the performance front.” 47/
That the Commission would proceed to adopt the independent chair
condition in spite of the Bobroff-Mack Report is hardly surprising, especially
given the fact that the amendments were not proposed as a means of enhancing
fund financial performance, but as a means of enhancing independent oversight of
conflict-of-interest transactions. The Commission believed “that having
independent chairmen can provide benefits and serve other purposes apart from
achieving high performance of the fund. In this regard, corporate governance
experts have pointed more generally to the value an independent chairman brings
to a corporate board of directors.” 48/ That does not mean that the Commission
failed to consider whether the rule amendments would promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation, but, as stated by the Supreme Court, “[i]t is not
infrequent that the available data do not settle a regulatory issue, and the agency
must then exercise its judgment in moving from the facts and probabilities on the

C.

The Commission Properly Considered Both the Costs of the Rule
Amendments, and the Alternatives Proposed by the Commenters.

Petitioner claims (Br. 43-45) that the Commission failed to consider the
costs related to the two conditions, particularly the cost of hiring staff to assist the
independent directors and independent chairs. In fact, both the 2004 Proposing
Release, 69 FR at 3478-79, and the 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR at 46386-87,
specifically discussed the benefits and the costs of the conditions. In the
proposing release the Commission acknowledged that the conditions would
impose some additional costs on funds that rely on an Exemptive Rule. 69 FR at
3479. However, the Commission said that it was not aware of any costs associated
with the hiring of staff because “boards typically have this authority under state
law, and the rule would not require them to hire employees.” Id. Nevertheless,
the Commission requested comment on whether boards would choose to hire
employees. Id. In the adopting release, the Commission again stated that the

49/

Petitioner again makes the claim (Br. 42-43) that Congress has determined
that the Commission “violated the [Investment Company Act] and the APA
as well,” and thus has rendered the independent chair condition “ipso facto
invalid.” Again, Congress did not make any such determinations – it simply
asked for a report.
58

Commission staff was not aware of any costs associated with the hiring of
employees or retaining experts. 69 FR at 46387. Although the amendments added
a provision to authorize the independent directors to hire employees and to retain
advisers and experts necessary to carry out their duties (69 FR at 46385), the
amendments did not require that they do so (69 FR at 46387). The cost, if any,
would be wholly within their discretion. Presumably any additional cost would be
incurred because the independent directors decided that it was in the interest of the
fund and its investors for them to retain staff to help them better carry out their
duties. 50/
Petitioner asserts (Br. 45) that the independent chair provision “will
inevitably impose search costs and in many instances will require funds to pay
board members higher salaries.” Petitioner does not explain why this is
“inevitable.” Some commenters believed that the independent chair could be
selected from among the fund’s existing independent directors. See John H. Hill,
Chairman of the Board, Putnam Mutual funds (R2: Letter 171), Ashok N. Bakhru,
Independent Chairman, Goldman Sachs Trust (R2: Letter 57), Fergus Reid III,

50/

The Commission noted (69 FR at 46387 n.81) that an independent chairman
might hire staff for assistance in carrying out his or her responsibilities as
chairman. However, the Commission said that it had no reliable basis for
estimating those costs.
59

Independent Chairman, JP Morgan Funds (R2: Letter 174). In any event, the
additional costs, if any, are speculative at this point, and the Commission had no
reliable basis for estimating those costs. 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR at 46387.
Similarly, the Commission explained that it could not estimate the cost of
compliance with the 75 percent independent director condition because it had no
basis for determining how funds would choose to satisfy the condition. Id. One
way described by the Commission that a fund could comply – decreasing the size
of its board and allowing some interested directors to resign – appears to involve
little or no cost. In all events, the Commission did find that the costs associated
with the amendments were minimal and that many funds had already adopted the
required practices. 69 FR at 46388. Because the costs, if any, were minimal and
difficult to evaluate, the Commission was not required somehow to come up with
a dollar estimate, as petitioner would have it do.
Next, petitioner argues (Br. 46-47) that the Commission did not give
adequate consideration to the idea of letting the independent directors choose the
board chair, whether the chair be independent or not. Of course, the Commission
did consider this issue. “To be clear,” the Commission said, “the amendments we
are adopting today do not prevent the independent directors from choosing the
most qualified and capable candidate. That candidate, however, cannot serve two
60

masters.” 69 FR at 46383. Petitioner dismisses the Commission’s conclusion that
the chair of a fund board “cannot serve two masters” as a “cliché” (Br. 46) and a
“quip” (Br. 47). In fact, it goes directly to the heart of the matter: enhancing the
board’s ability to protect the fund and its shareholders from conflicts of interest
with the adviser.
Finally, petitioner argues (Br. 47-48) that the Commission gave inadequate
consideration to alternatives to the independent chair condition, including the
alternative, mentioned by the dissenting commissioners, of enhanced disclosure of
whether or not the chair was independent. But the Commission is not required to
discuss every alternative raised. Here, the Commission discussed many of the
alternatives suggested by the commenters, including the major alternatives
proposed. 2004 Adopting Release, 69 FR at 46384. See Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 51 (“Nor do we broadly require an agency to
consider all policy alternatives in reaching a decision.”). No specific discussion of
this particular alternative was required, particularly since Congress rejected a
purely disclosure-based approach to regulating conflicts of interest under the Act.
