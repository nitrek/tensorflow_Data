AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Extension of comment period.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is extending the comment period for a
release proposing new Rule 13q-1 and an amendment to Form SD to implement Section 1504 of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to disclosure of
payments by resource extraction issuers [Release No. 34-76620 (Dec. 11, 2015); 80 FR 80057
(Dec. 23, 2015)]. The comment period for the proposal is divided between an initial comment
period and a period for reply comments. The original initial comment period is scheduled to end
on January 25, 2016 and the original period for reply comments is scheduled to end on February
16, 2016. The Commission is extending the time period in which to provide the Commission
with initial comments until February 16, 2016 and to provide reply comments until March 8,
2016. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the issues and prepare
their comments.
DATES: Initial comments are due on February 16, 2016. Reply comments, which may respond
only to issues raised in the initial comment period, are due on March 8, 2016. In developing the
final rules, the Commission may rely on both new comments and comments that have been
received to date, including those that were provided in connection with the prior rules that the
Commission issued under Section 13(q).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has requested comment on a release
proposing new Rule 13q-1 and an amendment to Form SD to implement Section 1504 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Section 1504 added Section
13(q) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which directs the Commission to issue rules
requiring resource extraction issuers to include in an annual report information relating to any
payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or an entity under the control of the
issuer, to a foreign government or the Federal Government for the purpose of the commercial
development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. Section 13(q) requires a resource extraction issuer
to provide information about the type and total amount of payments made for each project
related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals, and the type and total
amount of payments made to each government. In addition, Section 13(q) requires a resource
extraction issuer to provide certain information regarding those payments in an interactive data
format, as specified by the Commission.
The Commission originally requested that initial comments on the release be received by
January 25, 2016 and that reply comments, which may respond only to issues raised in the initial
comment period, be received by February 16, 2016. The Commission has received a request for

an extension of time for public comment on the proposal to, among other things, allow for the
collection of information and to improve the quality of responses. 1 The Commission believes
that providing the public additional time to consider thoroughly the matters addressed by the
release and to submit comprehensive responses to the release would benefit the Commission in
its consideration of final rules. Therefore, the Commission is extending the comment period for
Release No. 34-76620 “Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers” until February
16, 2016 for initial comments and until March 8, 2016 for reply comments.

By the Commission.

Dated: January 21, 2016

Brent J. Fields
Secretary.
