INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendants Luke C.

4

Zouvas (“Zouvas”), Cameron F. Robb (“Robb”), Christopher D. Larson (“Larson”),

5

Jason M. Schiprett (“Schiprett”) and Robert D. Jorgenson (“Jorgenson”) from

6

violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. From no later than

7

December 2011 through at least December 2012, Defendants engaged in a “pump-

8

and-dump” scheme to manipulate the market for the stock of Crown Dynamics

9

Corp. (“Crown”), a publicly-traded shell company.

10

2.

As part of the scheme, Larson obtained controlling shares of Crown

11

from Asher Z. Zwebner (“Zwebner”), an Israeli accountant who created and

12

secretly controlled the company and its stock. Although Larson controlled Crown

13

and acted as its de facto chief financial officer, his name did not appear in any of

14

Crown’s filings with the Commission. With the assistance of Zouvas, an attorney

15

based in San Diego who served as Crown’s general counsel, Larson transferred

16

free-trading Crown shares from Zwebner’s nominees – purported shareholders in

17

Crown’s initial public offering – to Larson’s nominees, including Jorgenson and

18

Schiprett. Larson then paid $400,000 for a “call center” to promote Crown and

19

placed manipulative trades in his own brokerage account to create the appearance

20

of market interest in the stock. Robb prepared materially misleading press releases

21

about the company’s business success. As Crown’s stock price became inflated as

22

a result of Larson’s and Robb’s efforts to pump the stock, Larson’s nominees

23

Jorgenson and Schiprett sold Crown shares and wired most of the sale proceeds – at

24

least $865,000 – to accounts controlled by Larson.

25

retained some of the proceeds as compensation for their assistance in the scheme as

26

nominees.

27

Jorgenson and Schiprett

As a result of the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants

violated Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities

U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5(a) and 240.10b-5(c). Unless restrained

4

and enjoined, Defendants are reasonably likely to continue to violate the federal

5

securities laws.

Minnesota Board of Accountancy censured Larson and imposed other sanctions.

24

During the relevant time period, he acted as de facto chief financial officer of

25

Crown, and he and Robb were business associates and co-managing members of

26

Bull Market. Larson also currently serves as the chief financial officer of Mix 1.

27

Also, as of June 2014, Larson was the chief financial officer and interim chief

During the relevant time period, Crown was a Delaware corporation.

15

On or about September 21, 2010, in its initial public offering registration statement,

16

Crown claimed it planned to develop a patent for a toothbrush. After its registration

became effective, the company’s stock began trading under the symbol CDYY and,

18

in January 2012, Crown announced a new product – an electronic monitoring

19

device called PomCom. During the relevant time period, Crown stock traded in the

20

U.S. on the over-the-counter market, and its IPO shares were issued in the U.S. by a

21

U.S. registered transfer agent. U.S. investors purchased and sold shares here and

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
11.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b),

3

20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a); and

4

Sections 21(d) and 27(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa(a).

5

12.

The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants and venue is

6

proper in this District because, among other things, Defendants participated in the

7

offer or sale of securities in this District, and many of the acts and transactions

8

constituting the violations alleged in this Complaint occurred in this District. In

9

addition, venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a

10

substantial part of the events giving rise to the Commission’s claims occurred here.

11

13.

In connection with the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Defendants,

12

directly and indirectly, singly or in concert with others, have made use of the means

13

or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, the means or instruments of

14

transportation or communication in interstate commerce, the mails, and/or the

15

facilities of a national securities exchange.

16

IV.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

17

A.

The Creation and Sale of the Crown Shell

18

14.

Zwebner created Crown as a shell company. Although the original

19

record owners of the company and its stock ostensibly were two officers, Amir

20

Rehavi (“Rehavi”) and Chanah Zehavi (“Zehavi”), in reality Zwebner controlled all

21

of the stock. In September 2010, he filed an S-1 registration statement with the

22

Commission for a purported self-directed offering under the smaller company

23

reporting rules and, behind the scenes, managed every aspect of the registration

24

process. In September 2011, Crown’s registration became effective.

25

15.

Zwebner, whose name and control of the company were undisclosed in

26

the registration statement, conducted a sham IPO through which he placed Crown’s

27

free-trading shares with 40 Israeli purported subscribers, but never delivered their

28

certificates. Instead, Zwebner took possession of the certificates, and the
-5-

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 6 of 26

1

subscribers never paid consideration for the shares and were unaware their names

2

even were involved at all. This initial public offering therefore was a sham.

3

16.

To add a further sense of legitimacy to the offering, however, and to

4

make the Crown shell a more attractive target for sale, Zwebner engaged a U.S.

5

broker-dealer in September 2011 to sponsor Crown’s false application under Rule

6

15c2-11 of the Exchange Act, 17 CFR § 240.15c2-11, so that Crown’s common

7

stock would be quoted on the OTCBB and the OTC Link (an SEC-registered

8

Alternative Trading System).

9

Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the application. Zwebner then

10

had a valuable commodity to sell: a fully-registered shell company with 2.5 million

11

free-trading shares, and a ready-made trading market into which the shares could be

12

sold.

13

17.

On or about November 2, 2011, the Financial

Ultimately, Larson purchased the Crown shell from Zwebner. On or

14

about December 6, 2011, Larson wired $300,000 from a bank account titled to an

15

entity he controlled – S&L Investments, LLC – to Zouvas’ trust account, which

16

reflected that payment was for Crown. Two days later, Zouvas wired $25,000 to

17

Zwebner. On or about December 14, 2011, Zouvas wired an additional $206,127 to

18

Zwebner through a financial cash change house in Jerusalem. The next day, Larson

19

wired an additional $25,000 from the same bank account he controlled to another of

20

Zouvas’ trust accounts. Larson thus gained control of Crown’s 2.5 million freely-

21

tradable shares that Zwebner had fraudulently placed in the names of the 40 Israeli

22

subscribers and the shares held by the two nominee officers of the company.

23

18.

Acquiring control of a publicly traded company generally involves an

24

acquisition or tender offer pursuant to which the acquirer purchases a control block

25

of common stock from the shareholders. Here, Larson purchased all of Crown’s

26

free-trading shares by paying and arranging for payment to Zwebner, who was not

27

even a named shareholder. Larson was able to gain control in this unusual manner

28

because Zwebner was simply transferring control of Crown’s outstanding stock,
-6-

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 7 of 26

1

including the two nominee officers’ shares and the shares placed with the 40 Israeli

2

subscribers in the sham IPO.

3

B.

Larson Places Crown Shares with His Nominees

4

19.

On or about December 14, 2011, after the purchase of the Crown shell

5

was complete, Larson arranged for Jorgenson and Schiprett to receive 218,750

6

Crown shares each from seven of the original Israeli subscribers for a total purchase

7

price of $25,850. In reality, however, this arrangement was a sham. As alleged

8

above, the original subscribers never received or paid for their shares (because they

9

were simply nominees for Zwebner), and Schiprett and Jorgenson never purchased

10

the Crown shares (because they were nominees for Larson). Larson orchestrated

11

this ruse to conceal his trading in Crown stock, and Jorgenson and Schiprett knew,

12

or were reckless in not knowing, they were participating in a scheme to conceal

13

Larson’s true ownership of the stock.

14

20.

In or around December 2011, Zouvas was retained as Crown’s general

15

counsel. One of his duties was to instruct the transfer agent on issuing, canceling,

16

re-issuing and otherwise transferring Crown stock certificates among record

17

shareholders. Larson turned to Zouvas to have the Crown certificates transferred

18

into the names of Jorgenson and Schiprett.

19

21.

On or about January 3, 2012, Zouvas directed Crown’s transfer agent

20

to transfer the shares from the seven Israeli subscribers to Jorgenson and Schiprett.

21

However, Zouvas instructed the transfer agent to send the certificates to Larson,

22

rather than to Jorgenson and Schiprett, the supposed shareholders of record. The

23

transfer agent did as Zouvas directed. As a result of a 3-for-1 forward stock split,

24

Jorgenson and Schiprett became the record owners of 656,250 free-trading Crown

25

shares each.

26

22.

The next step in the scheme was for Jorgenson and Schiprett to sell the

27

shares and remit the proceeds to Larson. On or about January 4, 2012, they each

28

opened securities brokerage accounts and attempted to deposit the Crown shares
-7-

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 8 of 26

1

into them. However, before allowing the deposit, the brokerage firm requested

2

proof they had purchased the shares. Because they had not paid for the shares,

3

however, no such proof existed.

4

23.

To enable Jorgenson and Schiprett to make the deposit, Zouvas

5

prepared a false attestation for them to provide to the brokerage firm. The

6

attestation was dated January 17, 2012. In it, Zouvas wrote that his law firm had

7

acted as escrow agent for the transaction in which Jorgenson and Schiprett had

8

purchased Crown shares for $25,850. He misrepresented that on December 14,

9

2011, he sent the funds to the selling shareholders. The attestation was false

10

because Zouvas’s escrow account never received the funds from Jorgenson and

11

Schiprett, and never remitted the funds to the seven purported subscribers. When

12

Zouvas provided the attestation, he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that it

13

was false.

14

24.

Jorgenson and Schiprett in turn provided Zouvas’ false attestation to

15

the brokerage firm, which allowed them to deposit the Crown shares into their

16

newly-opened brokerage accounts. Because they did not transfer funds to Zouvas’

17

escrow account, Jorgenson and Schiprett knew, or were reckless in not knowing,

18

that they were providing a false document to the brokerage firm.

19

25.

trades in his newly-opened brokerage account.
C.

22
23

On or about January 24, 2012, Jorgenson authorized Larson to place

Larson and Robb Install a CEO for Crown, But Larson Retains
Control of the Company

26.

After Jorgenson and Schiprett were in place, Larson needed to inflate

24

the market price of Crown’s stock so he could make back the money he spent to

25

purchase the Crown shell, and reap additional trading profits. His first step in the

26

“pump” phase of the scheme was to obtain a product for Crown by means of which

27

he could deceive public investors into believing Crown would generate substantial

28

revenue. Larson and Robb decided Crown’s product would be a wireless device
-8-

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 9 of 26

1

that would monitor senior citizens and special needs adults, branded as “PomCom.”

2

PomCom was the invention of an entrepreneur named Steven Aninye (“Aninye”)

3

who owned the technology through his alter ego company, Zorah, LLC.

4

27.

Although the PomCom existed and was functional, in order for any

5

significant number of the devices to be in use simultaneously, there needed to be an

6

operational infrastructure, including a support staff to receive and act upon the

7

devices’ electronic signals. Aninye did not have sufficient funding to pay for the

8

infrastructure. As a result, he was willing to enter into an arrangement with Larson

9

and Robb who assured him that by associating with Crown, he would obtain the

10

funding necessary to support the product. That funding, however, never

11

materialized.

12

28.

In or around January 2012, Larson and Robb solicited Aninye to

13

become Crown’s CEO.

14

Aninye, copying Robb: “Great news! The shell we have is Crown Dynamics Corp.

15

symbol (CDYYD).” Larson also told Aninye he had been providing the funding for

16

Crown and that now he wanted to recover his money. Robb told Aninye that he

17

and Larson were acquiring Crown by buying off the existing owners, that they

18

would make Aninye the company’s CEO, and that, as a result, money would never

19

again be a problem for Aninye.

20

29.

In an email dated January 5, 2012, Larson informed

That same month, Larson and Robb installed Aninye as Crown’s CEO.

21

Shortly thereafter, Zouvas’ law firm prepared an agreement whereby Aninye’s

22

company, Zorah LLC, licensed the PomCom technology to Crown. An attorney in

23

Zouvas’ law firm emailed the draft agreement to Larson, and Zouvas participated in

24

one or more conference calls with Larson, Robb and Aninye concerning the

25

agreement.

26

30.

In a February 2, 2012 email, Robb suggested to Aninye that Larson’s

27

and/or Robb’s control of the public float of Crown stock was compensation for

28

providing: a “[c]lean public company ready to trade”; “3 months of marketing to
-9-

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 10 of 26

1

the company to bring in new investors and provide the stock with a true market”;

2

and “Knowledge, Network, and understanding to establish market price and

3

position the company for financings . . . .”

4

D.

Crown’s Public Filings Falsely Report Aninye’s Stock Ownership

5

31.

On January 18, 2012, Crown filed a Form 8-K “Current Report” (“8-

6

K”) with the Commission. On the cover page, the 8-K requested that copies of all

7

communications be sent to Zouvas’ law firm. The 8-K disclosed that as of January

8

17, 2012, Crown’s purported sole officers and directors, Rehavi and Zehavi, had

9

resigned from the company and that Aninye had been appointed CEO and

10

Chairman of the Board. The 8-K also stated that on January 17, 2012, Aninye had

11

acquired from Rehavi and Zehavi nine million shares of Crown’s common stock,

12

representing approximately 54.54% of Crown’s issued and outstanding common

13

stock, and that Rehavi and Zehavi were paid $180,000 for the shares.

14

32.

The 8-K was false because Aninye never paid for the shares and never

15

received the share certificates, even though he signed a share purchase agreement.

16

Rehavi was unaware he was listed as an officer or director of Crown, did not act in

17

either capacity, and first heard about Crown when contacted by the Israel Securities

18

Authority (“ISA”) in mid-2014 when it was assisting the Commission in the

19

investigation of this matter.

20

33.

Although Crown publicly announced Aninye had purchased Rehavi’s

21

and Zehavi’s shares, Zouvas did not, at that time, instruct the transfer agent to

22

cancel their share certificates or reissue them in Aninye’s name.

23

certificates remained in Rehavi’s and Zehavi’s names for roughly seven months

24

after Aninye purportedly purchased their stock.

25

34.

In fact, the

Zouvas did eventually direct the transfer agent to remove Rehavi’s and

26

Zehavi’s names as record shareholders. But he did not direct the transfer agent to

27

transfer the shares to Aninye. Instead, on or about July 23, 2012, Zouvas instructed

28
- 10 -

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 11 of 26

1

the transfer agent to cancel the share certificates and retire the nine million shares to

2

Crown’s treasury account.

3

35.

On March 14, 2012, Crown filed a Form 10-K “Annual Report” (“10-

4

K”) with the Commission. Zouvas approved a draft of the Form 10-K falsely

5

reporting that Aninye owned the nine million shares of Crown, a statement which

6

was repeated in the final Form 10-K. Zouvas became Crown’s general counsel in

7

December 2011 and took responsibility for directing the transfer agent any time

8

shares of Crown needed to be cancelled or reissued. Zouvas therefore knew Aninye

9

did not receive any shares from Rehavi and Zehavi because he had not directed the

10

transfer agent to cancel the Rehavi and Zehavi share certificates or reissue them in

11

Aninye’s name.

12

36.

In a communication with FINRA three months later, Zouvas

13

reaffirmed the false 8-K by stating Aninye had purchased the nine million shares of

14

Crown from Rehavi and Zehavi for $180,000: “On January 17, 2012, the Company

15

executed a Stock Purchase Agreement, under which 9,000,000 (post-split) shares of

16

common stock of the Company were sold by Rehavi and Zehavi to Steve Aninye in

17

exchange for $180,000.” Zouvas knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his

18

statement to FINRA was false because (i) he never had the shares placed in

19

Aninye’s name, and (ii) he directed the transfer agent to cancel the shares and retire

20

them to Crown’s treasury.

21

E.

22
23

Larson’s Role as a De Facto Officer of Crown and Robb’s Role as
Crown’s Marketing Agent

37.

From December 2011 until at least July 2012, Robb took responsibility

24

for Crown’s marketing campaign. He prepared the company’s press releases and

25

with the assistance of a family member created its corporate web page. Robb

26

issued at least one press release before Aninye had a chance to review and comment

27

on its accuracy. Robb also rejected changes to the corporate web page that Aninye

28

proposed. In late January 2012, Robb suggested to Aninye that Robb create a
- 11 -

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 12 of 26

1

virtual office for Crown in Scottsdale, Arizona (near where Robb and Larson

2

resided, even though Aninye resided in Atlanta, Georgia). In doing so, Robb wrote:

3

“If Investors, Finra, SEC, have any indication that this is not a company worthy of

4

being public we will have a can of worms opened and we do not want that.”

5

38.

From December 2011 until at least July 2012, Larson served as

6

Crown’s de facto chief financial officer (“CFO”) and secretly controlled Crown.

7

Aninye viewed Larson as a seasoned CFO responsible for handling Crown’s

8

finances. Larson paid various third-party service providers on behalf of Crown,

9

including, among others, Zouvas, as Crown’s general counsel; Crown’s transfer

10
11

agent; and for a Standard & Poor’s listing.
39.

Larson also assisted in preparing Crown’s financial statements. In an

12

April 18, 2012 email to Aninye, Robb, and potential new management for Crown,

13

Larson wrote: “Dave [an outside accountant] and I took the liberty of assisting

14

Steve prepare his/Crowns financials prior to air coming on board . . . .” In

15

particular, Larson assisted the outside accountant in preparing, among others,

16

Crown’s draft Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Balance Sheet as of December 31,

17

2011, and its Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Income Statement for the Three

18

Months Ended March 31, 2012. Larson also was the point-of-contact for Crown’s

19

outside auditor. For example, on February 24, 2012, the auditor emailed Larson:

20

“As part of our audit of Crown we need to review the draft 10-K. Please send the

21

draft when it is available.” On February 28, 2012, Larson sent the auditor the draft

22

10-K with the cover message: “This our final [sic] may have a few minor

23

changes[.]” And when, in May 2012, Crown needed financial records from 2011 –

24

before Larson purchased the company from Zwebner – Larson emailed Zwebner:

25

“Do you have 1/1/11 through 3/31/11 income statement for Crown Dynamics?”

26

40.

Despite his control of Crown’s financial activities, Larson’s name

27

appeared nowhere in Crown’s public filings, including the 10-K filed with the

28

Commission on March 14, 2012. Crown’s filings also did not disclose the fact that

1

Larson – by virtue of his having purchased the Crown shell from Zwebner in

2

December 2011 – owned Crown’s outstanding stock.

3

41.

Larson knew, or was reckless in not knowing, the Form 10-K was false

4

because it failed to disclose his stock ownership and control of the company.

5

Having acted as escrow agent for Larson’s purchase of the Crown shell, and then

6

general counsel, Zouvas knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Crown’s public

7

disclosure of its securities ownership was materially false and misleading.

8

F.

Larson and Robb Artificially Inflate Crown’s Stock Price

9

42.

Having installed Aninye as CEO and licensed his product, Larson and

10

Robb were ready to “pump up” Crown’s stock price so that Larson could dump his

11

shares into the market at inflated prices. In late January 2012, they hired a “call

12

center” to tout Crown’s stock to brokers. On January 26, 2012, Robb emailed

13

Aninye that a “[c]all center is going to kick this off on Monday” and that “[t]hey

14

would like to do a webinar with you as they announce the deal to the 23+ guys who

15

will be making 2000 calls per day for the next 90 days.” The purpose of the call

16

center, Robb told Aninye, was to generate “buzz” in the market. Robb also told

17

Aninye that the market awareness campaign would last for just 90 days. Then,

18

Aninye would be on his own to drive the share price up, although he could hire

19

Robb to continue the campaign. The following day, Larson communicated to

20

Aninye, copying Robb, that Aninye would “need to do a [sic] investor presentation

21

to 23 brokers” and that “[t]his is SO IIMPORTANT [sic] to knock their socks off

22

on this.”

23

43.

Larson paid a company called Bay Hill Partners LLC (“Bay Hill”)

24

doing business as the Ritman Agency (“Ritman”) to publicize Crown in order to

25

increase its stock price. During the period January through April 2012, from bank

26

accounts belonging to Bull Market and National Cash & Credit, LLC (“NCC”)

27

(another entity Larson controlled), Larson wired a total of $400,000 to Bay Hill.

28

Bay Hill operated the “call center,” through Ritman, a self-described “full service

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 14 of 26

1

advertising firm, dedicated to aiding the success of emerging public companies”

2

that works “to communicate your company’s story to our vast network of brokers

3

. . . .” In exchange for Larson’s payments to Bay Hill, Ritman conducted an

4

aggressive awareness campaign to get stock brokers to recommend purchases of

5

Crown stock or to purchase the stock for their own accounts. Ritman

6

representatives placed 1,500 to 2,000 sales calls per day and were paid

7

commissions only for purchases that were made at the offer price.

8

44.

A Ritman employee who helped to manage the market awareness

9

campaign considered Larson the point of contact at Crown. In preparation for the

10

campaign, she gathered publicly-available information on Crown and prepared a

11

page of bullet points about Crown for Ritman’s callers to use when recommending

12

the stock to brokers. Among the bullet points were those labeled “Reasons to

13

Own.” On January 25, 2012, the employee emailed the draft bullet page to Larson,

14

requesting that he let her know if anything needed to be changed or if there was

15

anything important that needed to be highlighted.

16

45.

To provide the call center with information to include in its campaign,

17

Robb drafted press releases trumpeting the revenue-generating prospects of the

18

PomCom device. He did so in order to supply the call center with material it could

19

use to tout Crown’s stock to the market.

20

46.

On January 30, 2012, Robb emailed Aninye, copying Larson, a draft

21

press release titled: “Crown Dynamics is now ready to enter a $14.5 Billion U.S.

22

healthcare market opportunity with its proprietary hardware and software solution.”

23

Robb copied Larson on the email.

24

quotation from Aninye stating in part: “. . . our technology provides Crown with a

25

turn key solution that will allow the company to quickly enter the market and

26

immediately begin generating revenue.” Aninye did not want to issue the press

27

release as written. He believed it was inaccurate to announce that Crown was

28

entering a market, because Crown did not have the infrastructure to support the

The press release contained a purported

1

operations of the PomCom device. He replied to Robb: “I will like for us to take a

2

different approach with this PR. I think it is not about Crown entering a market but

3

Crown announcing a new product. I will take a stab at it. Also, let’s do it tomorrow

4

and use today to massage it a bit.” In response, Robb replied that he had already

5

issued the press release, without waiting for Aninye to correct it. Robb knew, or as

6

reckless in not knowing, that the press release was not accurate.

7

47.

On February 7, 2012, Robb drafted and caused Crown to issue another

8

misleading press release.

9

announce that it has initiated full commercial use of its Location Based Software

10

Service Platform.” It also contained the following quotation purportedly from

11

Aninye: “Owning and operating the platform allows our company to generate

12

revenue from direct high margin solutions as well as in-direct services to other

13

equipment manufacturers.” The press release was inaccurate because the PomCom

14

was not generating revenue for Crown in February 2012. In fact, in an email sent

15

on March 5, 2012 from Larson to Aninye copying Robb, Larson remarked: “Every

16

investor I speak to about investing in Crown points to the . . . fact you have zero

17

sales.” Robb knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the press release was

18

inaccurate.

19

48.

The press release stated that Crown “is pleased to

The “pump” was successful. On or about January 30, 2012, Ritman

20

kicked off its campaign to induce investors to purchase Crown stock. That day, the

21

trading volume in Crown’s stock was approximately 191,000, a 95-fold increase

22

over the 2,000 shares that had changed hands on the prior trading day. During the

23

90-day period of call-center activity, Crown’s stock price increased substantially

24

from its $1.40 per share market price immediately before the call center activity

25

began. On April 20, 2012, Crown’s stock price reached $2.50 per share.

26

49.

Each morning during the campaign, Ritman emailed Larson a

27

spreadsheet showing Crown purchases that resulted from the calls to brokers. At

28

the conclusion of the market awareness campaign, Ritman reported the results to
- 15 -

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 16 of 26

1

Larson. On May 2, 2012, it emailed Larson a spreadsheet that displayed trading in

2

Crown stock during the period January 30, 2012, through May 1, 2012. The

3

spreadsheet identified the date, time, volume and price of each Crown trade, and the

4

brokerage firm through which the trade was made.

5

50.

During the 90-day period of call-center activity, Larson also engaged

6

in his own manipulative trading to create the appearance of an active market in

7

Crown’s stock, as a further inducement to investors to purchase the stock. On or

8

about February 1, 2012, Larson purchased 250 shares of Crown stock in his

9

personal trading account, for $1.68 per share. The same day, Larson sold the 250

10

Crown shares for the same price, $1.68 per share. Thereafter, during the next three

11

months Larson purchased or sold Crown stock 44 more times. There was no

12

legitimate investment purpose to his trading. All told, Larson purchased 7,460

13

shares and sold the same amount. Larson knew, or was reckless in not knowing,

14

that his own trading was not for legitimate investment purposes but instead to

15

deceive investors into believing there was an active trading market for Crown’s

16

stock.

Larson Dumps Crown Shares into the Inflated Market through his
Nominees

51.

While Larson and Robb were successfully “pumping up” Crown’s

20

stock price, Schiprett and Jorgenson were selling their shares into the inflated

21

market.

22

52.

Between January 25, 2012, and May 2, 2012, Schiprett sold 220,793

23

shares of Crown stock he had pretended to purchase from the Israeli subscribers.

24

The proceeds from those sales were approximately $427,000.

25

53.

Between January 30, 2012, and April 12, 2012, Jorgenson sold

26

273,086 shares of the Crown stock he had pretended to purchase from the

27

subscribers. The proceeds from those sales were approximately $488,000.

54.

As Jorgenson and Schiprett sold the stock, they quickly funneled most

of the proceeds back to Larson, the undisclosed owner of the stock.
55.

Between March and May 2012, Schiprett transferred approximately

4

$402,000 of the trading proceeds to two bank accounts over which Larson was the

5

authorized signatory – 84% of it to an account belonging to Bull Market, and 16%

6

to NCC, the other bank account Larson controlled.

7

56.

During almost the same period, Jorgenson transferred approximately

8

$462,000 of the trading proceeds to the Bull Markets account that Larson

9

controlled.

10

57.

Larson thus received at least $865,000 as a result of his nominees’

11

sales of Crown stock. Schiprett retained approximately $25,000 of the trading

12

proceeds as compensation for his role in the scheme and Jorgenson retained

13

approximately $26,000 of the proceeds. Subsequently, on or about May 23, 2012,

14

after the Crown stock had been sold through his brokerage account and he had

15

wired the proceeds to Larson, Jorgenson directed the brokerage firm to remove

16

Larson’s authority to trade in the account.

17

58.

The call center activities ended in or about early May 2012, and after

18

that Crown’s stock price declined significantly. By May 16, 2012, the price had

19

dropped to $1.60 per share. On May 23, 2012, it closed at $0.99 per share. By

20

August 2012, it was trading at less than one dollar per share and, in September

21

2012, it traded as low as $0.37 per share.

22

59.

Through his payments to Bay Hill, Larson recommended that public

23

investors purchase shares of Crown. Unbeknownst to the market, at that very time

24

Larson, through Schiprett and Jorgenson, was selling almost a half million shares of

25

Crown stock against his buy recommendation and at the expense of the investing

26

public. Larson knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that his sales of large

27

quantities of his Crown stock ran counter to the buy recommendations he was

28

paying Bay Hill to make.

Zouvas Receives Crown Shares and Provides False Certification to
Transfer Agent

60.

In or around June 2012, Zouvas received 87,500 shares of Crown stock

4

for which he paid no consideration. According to a stock purchase agreement dated

5

June 25, 2012, Zouvas purchased 87,500 shares of Crown stock from one of the

6

original purported Israeli subscribers for $2,000. According to a second stock

7

purchase agreement dated June 19, 2012, a third-party entity purchased 100,000

8

shares of Crown stock from the same purported subscriber for $2,000. The

9

purported subscriber was – like the other subscribers – Zwebner’s nominee. She

10

did not purchase the shares or sell them to Zouvas or to the third party, nor was she

11

even aware the stock certificate had been issued in her name.

12

communicated with Zouvas and her signature was forged on the Stock Purchase

13

Agreement.

14

61.

She never

On or about June 25, 2012, Zouvas directed the transfer agent to

15

transfer the subscriber’s shares to himself and the third party. In his instruction

16

letter to the transfer agent, Zouvas wrote, in part: “We certify that these shares have

17

been validly purchased by the following parties,” including the third party and

18

Zouvas himself. The certification was inaccurate because Zouvas did not purchase

19

the Crown shares referred to in the letter, and the purported subscriber did not sell

20

the shares either to Zouvas or the third party. When Zouvas made the certification,

21

he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that it was inaccurate.

22

62.

Approximately one year later, in July 2013, Zouvas deposited the

23

87,500 Crown shares into his brokerage account. Between September 27 and

24

October 7, 2013, Zouvas sold all of the 87,500 Crown shares he purportedly

25

acquired for proceeds of approximately $10,300. Zouvas also received legal fees

26

and other payments related to Crown in addition to his stock sale proceeds.

I.

Larson Transfers Other Crown Shares into an Additional

2

Nominee Account and Zouvas Prepares a False Attestation Letter

3

and a False Certification

4

63.

With Zouvas’s assistance, Larson placed some additional Crown

5

shares he had acquired when he purchased the Crown shell in the names of other

6

nominees. For example, on or about December 14, 2011, an offshore entity named

7

Netlynx Solutions, Ltd. (“Netlynx”) purportedly entered into a share transfer

8

agreement with six of the original purported Israeli subscribers. Pursuant to the

9

agreement, Netlynx purchased 375,000 Crown shares (1.125 million post-split

10

shares) for $20,800. Netlynx, however, did not pay for the shares pursuant to the

11

share transfer agreement. On or about January 3, 2012, Zouvas instructed the

12

transfer agent to transfer 1.125 million Crown shares from the subscribers to

13

Netlynx. He further instructed the transfer agent to send the Netlynx share

14

certificate to Larson.

15

64.

A few weeks after Larson received the Netlynx certificate, Robb

16

emailed a letter to Aninye, with the instruction: “Please sign the attached letter and

17

fax it or scan it to Chris [Larson] asap.” The letter was addressed to a brokerage

18

firm and concerned 1.125 million Crown shares held by Netlynx. The letter was

19

written for Aninye’s signature, and it certified, among other things, that Netlynx

20

had acquired the shares from several of Crown’s IPO subscribers. The letter also

21

stated the brokerage firm “is permitted to rely on the above representations in

22

accepting the deposit of the Shares into a brokerage account for resale.” As

23

instructed by Robb, Aninye signed the letter.

24

65.

On or about January 31, 2012, just as he had done for Schiprett and

25

Jorgenson, Zouvas provided a false attestation letter submitted to the same

26

securities brokerage firm about Netlynx’s shares. Zouvas wrote that on December

27

14, 2011, he had acted as escrow agent for Netlynx’s purchase of Crown stock. He

28

falsely attested that he had sent the funds from his escrow account to the sellers.
- 19 -

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 20 of 26

1

Zouvas’ attestation was false because Netlynx did not pay any funds into Zouvas’

2

escrow account on December 14, 2011, and Zouvas never sent funds to the Israeli

3

subscribers who purportedly sold their shares to Netlynx. When Zouvas made this

4

attestation he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that it was false.

5

66.

At or about the time Larson and Zouvas transferred Crown shares to

6

Netlynx, they transferred additional shares into the name of another nominee, one

7

of Larson’s family members. Larson persuaded him to sign a share purchase

8

agreement that purported to show the purchase of 187,500 Crown shares from one

9

of the original purported Israeli subscribers for $3,645. The subscriber was, in

10

reality, Zwebner’s nominee. She never paid for the Crown shares and was unaware

11

the shares even had been issued in her name. Likewise, Larson’s family member

12

never paid for the shares he had purportedly purchased from the subscriber.

13

67.

On or about February 2, 2012, Zouvas instructed the transfer agent to

14

transfer the subscriber’s shares to Larson’s family member, but to send the newly-

15

issued share certificate to Zouvas rather than to the family member, the shareholder

16

of record. In Zouvas’s instruction to the transfer agent, he provided the following

17

false certification: “We certify that these shares have been validly purchased by the

18

following parties.” By February 21, 2012, the stock certificate was in Larson’s

19

hands, not his family member’s.

20

68.

Several months later, the family member saw the stock certificate for

21

the first (and only) time, but only briefly. Larson sent it to him – but only to

22

facilitate the transfer of the certificate to a third party. Larson instructed him to

23

obtain a medallion signature guarantee on the certificate and return it to Larson.

24

69.

Under certain circumstances, in order to transfer or sell securities, a

25

shareholder must have his or her signature guaranteed by a financial institution –

26

this process is often referred to as a medallion signature guarantee.

27
28

70.

The family member did as he was instructed and returned the

medallion signature certificate to Larson. Shortly thereafter, Larson sold the shares
- 20 -

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 21 of 26

1

to a third party without the family member’s knowledge. The family member’s

2

signature was forged on the share transfer agreement, and he never knew of the

3

transaction or received any financial benefit from the sale of his shares.

4

71.

In July and December 2012, Defendants made additional sales of

5

Crown stock. On or about July 16, 2012, approximately 3.3 million shares were

6

sold to third-party purchasers pursuant to share purchase agreements between the

7

purchasers and several of the original Israeli IPO subscribers. However, as alleged

8

above, Larson had purchased all of the free-trading shares from Zwebner and

9

allocated a portion of those shares to, among others, Schiprett and Jorgenson.

10

These additional 3.3 million shares were part of Larson’s purchase that had not

11

otherwise already been allocated. On or about July 25, 2012, Zouvas received

12

$57,551.31 into his escrow account from the purchasers as the sale proceeds for the

13

sale of these additional shares of Crown stock. Zouvas in turn wired $17,271 of

14

this money to the NCC bank account Larson controlled and $40,000 to Bay Hill,

15

which used the money for a promotional campaign they were conducting on

16

Larson’s behalf pertaining to another issuer.

17

72.

On December 4, 2012, Zouvas received $39,545 into his escrow

18

account from some or all of these same purchasers as the sale proceeds for the sale

19

of an additional approximately 2.1 million shares of Crown stock from Larson’s

20

family member, Jorgenson, Schiprett, and Netlynx. Zouvas subsequently wired

21

$39,000 of this money to the Bull Markets bank account that Larson controlled.

22

Robb signed the stock power for the sale of the Netlynx shares, indicating his

23

control over those shares. In addition, at least 1.3 million additional Crown shares

24

were allocated to an entity named Hyperion with which Robb was affiliated.

25
26

Defendants’ Scienter
73.

Robb knowingly, recklessly, or negligently drafted and issued false

27

press releases concerning Crown’s PomCom product. Larson engaged Jorgenson

28

and Schiprett to act as nominees to conceal his trading in Crown. Larson and Robb,
- 21 -

Case 3:16-cv-00998-CAB-DHB Document 1 Filed 04/25/16 Page 22 of 26

1

individually or through their entity Bull Market, knowingly or recklessly

2

manipulated the share price of Crown common stock through arranging call-center

3

activity designed to artificially increase the price of the stock. In addition, Larson

4

engaged in manipulative trading designed to artificially stimulate market interest in

5

the stock. Larson then sold into that increasing volume and price for profits that

6

were routed back to bank accounts he controlled by Jorgenson and Schiprett.

7

74.

Jorgenson and Schiprett knowingly provided a letter to a registered

8

brokerage firm that falsely stated they had purchased Crown stock from the original

9

purported subscribers for $25,850. Jorgenson and Schiprett profited from this

10
11

misconduct by receiving a portion of the proceeds of the trading in Crown stock.
75.

Zouvas provided an attestation to Jorgenson and Schiprett that falsely

12

stated they paid for their Crown shares. When he did so, he knew or was reckless

13

in not knowing they would provide the attestation to a registered brokerage firm to

14

transact the purchase and sale of securities. Zouvas provided a similar attestation

15

directly to the brokerage firm that falsely stated Netlynx had paid for its Crown

16

shares. Zouvas also knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements

17

to a registered transfer agent concerning payments to the supposed original Crown

18

subscribers in private “sales” transactions. Zouvas profited at least by receiving

19

Crown shares and legal fees. He subsequently sold 87,500 of his Crown (Airware)

20

shares in October of 2013 that he acquired in July of 2012. Zouvas received

21

proceeds of approximately $10,300 in connection with that transaction.
