16 Civ. ______ ( )
ECF CASE
JURY TRIAL
DEMANDED

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), for its complaint
against Defendants Contrarian Press, LLC (“Contrarian Press”), Scott S. Fraser (“Fraser”), and
Nathan Yeung (“Yeung,” and together with Contrarian Press and Fraser, “Defendants”), alleges:
SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS
1.

From approximately September 2011, Fraser—the CEO of the penny stock issuer

Empowered Products, Inc. (“EMPO”)—concealed from the investing public his and EMPO’s
involvement with and funding of at least three separate promotional campaigns touting EMPO.

Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 2 of 23

2.

As part of the first promotional campaign in September and October 2011, Fraser,

who was also the writer and publisher of stock-picking newsletters, and Contrarian Press,
Fraser’s publishing company, made materially false and misleading statements about their
relationship with EMPO.
3.

Fraser and Contrarian Press touted EMPO’s business prospects and repeatedly

recommended—in e-mails and/or hard-copy mailers—the purchase of EMPO shares.
Specifically, Fraser and Contrarian Press authored and distributed highly-positive articles about
EMPO’s business without disclosing in those articles that (a) EMPO’s CEO Fraser prepared and
distributed the articles and owned and ran Contrarian Press; and (b) EMPO and Contrarian Press
had entered into an “Investor Relations / Sales and Marketing Agreement” (“Investor Relations
Agreement”), under which EMPO paid thousands of dollars per month to Contrarian Press, in
part, to promote its business and stock. As a result, the promotional campaign fraudulently hid
the fact that it was, in essence, sponsored by the EMPO, the very company the promotional
articles were recommending.
4.

In order to make this promotional campaign more effective, Fraser and Contrarian

Press worded the promotional articles to create the false appearance of objectivity in reporting on
EMPO’s prospects. For example, Fraser wrote a number of the promotional articles under an
alias, “Charlie Buck.” These promotional articles failed to disclose that Fraser was both
EMPO’s CEO and the promoter hiding behind the alias of “Charlie Buck”, and drafted to create
the false and misleading appearance that the author was an objective third-party, unconnected to
EMPO and Fraser, who was strongly recommending the purchase of EMPO stock. For example,
(a) when using the “Charlie Buck” alias as the author of articles, Fraser referred to EMPO’s CEO
(himself) in the third person; and (b) the articles explicitly disclaimed Contrarian Press’s receipt

2


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 3 of 23

of payments from EMPO, despite the monthly payments made under the Investor Relations
Agreement.
5.

As part of the second and third promotional campaigns—which ran in May 2012

and October through mid-November 2012, respectively—Fraser and Contrarian Press hired third
parties, including Yeung, to arrange the promotion of EMPO and its stock in order to further
obscure Contrarian Press’s and Fraser’s direction of the promotional campaigns. For example,
from approximately summer through fall 2012, Yeung—working under the alias “Mason Zhang”
and through a front company, “Crown Pacifica Media Services”—arranged a promotional
campaign for EMPO’s stock. Although Yeung worked at Fraser’s direction and under his
control, the promotional materials did not disclose Fraser’s and Contrarian Press’s involvement
in the campaign and the fact that EMPO was paying Contrarian Press to promote its business and
stock.
6.

As a result of Defendants’ fraud, the investing public was misled both (a) as to the

objectivity of the promotional material, specifically, that the promotional campaigns were
arranged by EMPO’s CEO; and (b) that EMPO paid for Contrarian Press to promote its stock.
7.

Defendants’ efforts to promote EMPO’s stock were successful. During each of

the promotional campaigns, EMPO’s stock volume and/or price increased substantially.
VIOLATIONS
8.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
11.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d),

22(a), and 22(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d), 77v(a), and 77v(c)] and

12.

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa].

Bulletin Board, certain of the stock promoters hired by Defendants to distribute promotional
materials at issue in this case were based in Manhattan, and payments were made to at least one
promoter through an account in New York City.
13.

In connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business

alleged in this Complaint, Defendants directly or indirectly have made use of the means and

5

instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of the facilities of a national
securities exchange.

times, Fraser was the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, and a major
EMPO shareholder. Fraser was also the owner and President of Contrarian Press.
15.

Nathan Yeung, age 28, is a resident of Vancouver, Canada.

16.

of California. At all relevant times, Contrarian Press had offices in San Diego, California.
RELATED ENTITY
17.

Empowered Products, Inc., is a Nevada corporation with its principal offices in

Las Vegas, Nevada. EMPO described itself as a manufacturer of gels and other “sexual health”
products.
FACTS
I.

Contrarian Press Background
18.

Fraser founded Contrarian Press in approximately 1992 and at all relevant times

owned and controlled the company. Contrarian Press’s business was to publish newsletters and
other information that promoted ideas for investing in securities, including making stock-picking
recommendations.
19.

Contrarian Press published its investing newsletters under a number of titles,

including “The Natural Contrarian,” “Charlie Buck’s Situational Strategies,” “Stock-Profit
Guide,” and “Contrarian Wealth Coalition.”
20.

Contrarian Press and Fraser distributed the promotional materials through a

6


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 7 of 23

variety of means, including by posting on websites controlled by Contrarian Press and Fraser and
sending them by e-mail and direct mail.
21.

Fraser personally authored or authorized the content and distribution of

Contrarian Press’s newsletters and other publications.
II.

EMPO Background
22.

Fraser founded EMPO in approximately 2002. At all relevant times, Fraser

served as EMPO’s President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, and was a major
shareholder.
23.

EMPO became a public company in approximately June 2011 by reverse merging

with a public company called On Time Filings, Inc., which then changed its name to Empowered
Products, Inc. Following the reverse merger, EMPO’s stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin
Board and OTC Link under the ticker symbol “EMPO.”
III.

The Investor Relations Agreement
24.

On July 1, 2011—immediately after EMPO became a public company—Fraser

caused EMPO and Contrarian Press to enter into the Investor Relations Agreement. Fraser
signed the agreement on behalf of EMPO and directed a Contrarian Press employee to sign for
Contrarian Press.
25.

Under the Investor Relations Agreement, Contrarian Press served as a consultant

to EMPO, with the aim of, among other things, helping EMPO to attract new shareholders. To
that end, the agreement set out Contrarian Press’s “objectives” as being:
[T]o establish, maintain, and expand the shareholder bases of its
clients, and create wholesale and retail consumer awareness for the
purpose of increasing product sales. Contrarian Press’s complete
service package is designed to provide a continuous stream of
communication to the investing public and retail consumer with
response mechanisms that expand the active interest of new and
7


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 8 of 23

current shareholders and consumers. The ultimate goal of this
agreement between Contrarian Press and its clients is to attain the
highest shareholder and consumer loyalty through consistent
quality-controlled information services.
26.

Under the terms of the Investor Relations Agreement, EMPO initially paid

Contrarian Press $14,500 per month. This amount increased over time, eventually reaching at
least $19,500 per month. From 2011 through 2014, EMPO paid Contrarian Press approximately
$1 million pursuant to the Investor Relations Agreement. These payments were significant to
EMPO, which reported net losses in each of 2011, 2012, and 2014, and net income of only
$134,000 in 2013.
IV.

Contrarian Touts EMPO’s Stock
27.

Shortly after entering into the Investor Relations Agreement—and true to its

agreement to attempt to expand EMPO’s shareholder base—Contrarian Press began touting
EMPO’s stock in promotional newsletters. However, in order to create the false and misleading
appearance of objectivity, the Contrarian Press promotional materials, as drafted by Fraser,
masqueraded as objective and independent stock picking newsletters, with no disclosure of
Fraser’s involvement with Contrarian Press, or that Fraser was, in fact, “Charlie Buck,” the
supposedly independent stock analyst-author of Contrarian Press newsletters that so highly
touted the prospects of EMPO.
28.

For example, on September 9, 2011, Contrarian Press issued a newsletter called

the “Stock-Profit Guide,” which stated that “Empowered Products (EMPO) represents a solid
growth stock that just launched at $1.25 per share.” This newsletter purported to be written by
“Charlie Buck.” “Charlie Buck” was a pseudonym for Fraser, who was the true author of the
Stock Profit Guide. In authoring the Stock Profit Guide, Fraser took additional steps to create
the appearance that neither he nor EMPO were involved in its preparation. For example, Fraser
8


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 9 of 23

phrased the newsletter as an objective evaluation of EMPO, for example by discussing himself in
the third person, to create the false impression that Charlie Buck was an objective third party:
What I am impressed with most at this early stage is the company’s
global sales reach and expanding revenue/growth model. I also
love that Empowered Products is a U.S. corporation operating in
America, employing American workers, and manufacturing its
production on U.S. soil . . . . According to the company,
Empowered has obtained over 85 trademarks for its products
worldwide. And, over the last five operational years, EMPO has
reported a steady increase in the operational capacity/efficiency of
its Las Vegas, Nevada, bottling facility . . . .
I have known the founder, president, and CEO of Empowered
Products, Scott Fraser, for many years and I’ve watched the
company grow from a small, private entity nine years ago to a
rapidly emerging publicly traded corporation today.
29.

The Stock Profit Guide was an exhortation to buy EMPO’s stock. In it Fraser

styled the information about EMPO as “Preemptive Profit-Positioning” and invited readers to
invest:
Keep in mind also that Empowered Products just launched onto the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board exchange in July 2011 under the
symbol EMPO, which mean you have an opportunity to own
shares in an established wellness company that just commenced
public trading.
Empowered Products, in my opinion, has every indicator of being
able to successfully transition to a senior stock exchange such as
the NYSE-Amex or Nasdaq within the near-term. For those
interested in a wellness company with nearly a decade of
successful operations that’s also a brand new growth stock, I
believe Empowered Products (EMPO) has all the pieces in-place to
merit a buy recommendation at this early stage.
30.

The newsletter went on to say that the “author . . . does not accept compensation

from publicly traded companies in return for his commentary,” without disclosing that the actual
author was Fraser, who was both the CEO of EMPO and the owner of Contrarian Press, which
was, in fact, well compensated by EMPO for its promotion of the company.
9


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 10 of 23

31.

All of these statements were materially false and misleading. In effect, EMPO

was promoting itself, without disclosing that it was doing so.
32.

Throughout September and October 2011, Contrarian Press issued additional

Stock-Profit Guides promoting EMPO as a good investment. For example, Fraser wrote:

33.

•	

“Empowered Products (EMPO) represents a solid growth stock”;

•	

“Start buying EMPO . . . now at $1.25 per share with a buy-ceiling set at
$1.35”;

•	

“EMPO shareholders who buy now up to $1.35 own a proven growth
model”;

•	

“Buy shares in this emerging global wellness company today”; and

•	

“EMPO shares remain within our buy-range at the current $1.25 level”.

Fraser authored each of these newsletters. However, as with the September 9,

2011 newsletter, Fraser presented the Stock-Profit Guides as objective analysis of EMPO and its
prospects, and he concealed that he was the moving force behind the promotions.
34.

In these subsequent newsletters, Fraser again spoke about “Scott Fraser” in the

third person, creating the impression that the newsletters were written by an objective third party.
Thus, on both September 16 and 21, 2011, Fraser and Contrarian Press issued newsletters
purporting to describe an “interview with [EMPO’s] CEO, Scott Fraser” and stating that they had
“known the founder, president, and CEO of Empowered Products, Scott Fraser, for many years.”
35.

In addition, each of these newsletters disclaimed Contrarian Press’s connection to

EMPO, stating that it “did not accept compensation in return for this commentary.” This
statement was materially false and misleading because it concealed that EMPO, working through
Fraser, had approved and paid for these materials to be published and further created the
misleading appearance that the newsletters were objective analysis of EMPO’s prospects.
36.		

Fraser—who obviously understood his dual roles at Contrarian Press and EMPO
10 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 11 of 23

and knew about the Investor Relations Agreement—knew (or recklessly disregarded) that these
newsletters were materially false and misleading.
37.

Fraser and Contrarian Press distributed the Contrarian Press newsletters to

subscribers by e-mail and/or direct mail.
38.

EMPO’s shares began trading on or about July 19, 2011. Between July 19, 2011

and September 5, 2011, EMPO’s stock traded between $1.00 and $1.25 per share, with an
average daily trading volume of approximately 365 shares per day. From September 9, 2011
through October 12, 2011—while Fraser and Contrarian Press were issuing their false and
misleading newsletters—the average daily trading volume increased to approximately 1,263
shares per day (a 240% increase).
V.

The May 2012 EMPO Stock Promotion
39.

In May 2012, Fraser and Contrarian Press again undertook a campaign to promote

EMPO stock while EMPO continued to make monthly payments to Contrarian Press for investor
relations activities. This time, however, they took efforts to hide both Fraser’s and Contrarian
Press’s involvement in the campaign.
40.

Fraser arranged for his long-time associate (“Associate 1”) to organize the

promotional campaign through his companies, Red Rock Marketing Group (“Red Rock”) and
Silver Crest Equity Research. By May 2012, Associate 1 and Red Rock had a longstanding
relationship with Fraser and Contrarian Press. Red Rock was a print-broker, which coordinated
printing jobs, renting e-mail lists for stock promotions, and distributing printed materials by
direct mail and e-mail. Fraser and Contrarian Press represented virtually all of Red Rock’s and
Associate 1’s business, and Red Rock and Associate 1 arranged for the printing and distribution
of stock promotions for Fraser and Contrarian Press.

11 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 12 of 23

41.

In addition, Associate 1 and Red Rock did work for EMPO. For example, from

January through early May, 2012, EMPO paid Red Rock approximately $37,000 for various
jobs. Moreover, in 2012, Fraser referred to Associate 1 as an EMPO employee and provided
Associate 1 with an EMPO e-mail address, at which Fraser corresponded with him. In January
2012, Fraser sent an email to his EMPO employees noting that he appointed Associate 1 as
EMPO’s “vice president of sales and business development.”
42.

Associate 1 also owned Silver Crest Equity Research, which published a stock

investment newsletter called the “Investor Stock Advisory.” Associate 1 attributed the articles in
the Investor Stock Adviser to a pseudonym, “George Hughes.” However, Associate 1 was
responsible for hiring copy writers and approving the substance and distribution of the
newsletter.
43.

In April 2012, Associate 1 paid another associate of Fraser’s—who was also a

regular contributor to Contrarian Press’s own promotional articles—$2,500 to write the copy for
an Investor Stock Advisory promotional newsletter about EMPO.
44.

Fraser saw and approved the Investor Stock Advisory newsletter about EMPO

before it was distributed to the investing public. Associate 1 hired a number of stock promoters
to distribute the EMPO newsletters to their subscribers by e-mail. In order to ensure that the email distribution went smoothly, those promoters undertook a test distribution to a small group
of e-mail addresses provided to them by Red Rock, which included Associate 1 and Fraser.
Therefore, Fraser knew (or recklessly) disregarded that Investor Stock Advisory was issuing a
promotional newsletter about EMPO before it was distributed to prospective investors.
45.

From approximately May 1 through May 23, 2012, Red Rock distributed Investor

Stock Advisory newsletters touting EMPO’s stock—through third-party stock promoters hired

12 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 13 of 23

by Red Rock—to at least hundreds of thousands of potential investors. The Investor Stock
Advisory newsletters repeatedly urged the purchase of EMPO stock, stating for example:

46.		

•	

EMPO’s “$1 Stock Can Only Go UP!”;

•	

“EMPO at around $1.00 could catapult above $15.00 by this time next
year . . . ”;

•	

“So, how do you make money on EMPO today? It’s simple. You buy the
stock right now around $1 and then sell part of your position during the
first projected run to above $3. Then, hold onto the remainder of your
EMPO shares and watch your net worth multiple . . . .”; and

•	

“I’m issuing an immediate STRONG BUY for Empowered Products
(EMPO) . . . Get in now and $5,000 could quickly grow to $25,000+.”

The Investor Stock Advisory newsletters contained a disclaimer that:
This stock profile is paid advertisement. In order to enhance
public awareness of Empowered Products (EMPO) and its
securities through the distribution of this report, Mass Media
Advertising paid the publisher, Silver Crest Equity Research, the
sum of $326,700 . . . All trademarks used in this publication are
the property of their respective trademark holders. Silver Crest
Equity Research is not affiliated, connected, or associated with,
and are not sponsored, approved, or originated by, the trademark
holders unless otherwise stated.

47.

This statement was, at a minimum, materially misleading because it created the

false impression that Silver Crest Equity Research was an independent firm, while not disclosing
that Associate 1 was EMPO’s vice president of sales and marketing at the time of this promotion
and that almost all of his business was derived from Fraser, Contrarian Press, and EMPO. Nor
did it disclose that Fraser (and, therefore, EMPO) had arranged for the promotion, that Fraser had
reviewed and approved the promotional materials before they were distributed, or that EMPO
had paid Red Rock Marketing approximately $10,000 in May 2012.
48.

During the promotions—from approximately May 1 through May 23, 2012—

EMPO’s trading volume increased from an average of 2,909 shares per day in April 2012 to
13 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 14 of 23

45,866 shares per day (approximately a 1,400% increase).
	
49.

The expenses for this promotional campaign—the $326,700 referenced in the

above disclaimer—were paid by another of Fraser’s long-time associates, through a company
called Mass Media Advertising Ltd.
VI.

The October 2012 Stock Promotion
A.

Contrarian Press and Fraser Hire Yeung to Promote EMPO’s Stock.

50.

In approximately summer 2012, Fraser and Contrarian Press hired Yeung to

undertake another surreptitious promotion of EMPO’s stock (among other tasks).
51.

To hide his true identity, Yeung determined to arrange for the EMPO promotional

campaign under the pseudonym “Mason Zhang”. On August 21, 2012, Yeung asked Contrarian
Press’s IT specialist to provide him with an e-mail address—“mz@contrarianpress.com”—that
corresponded to that pseudonym. That same day Contrarian Press’s IT specialist set up that email address for Yeung and copied Fraser on the e-mail correspondence.
52.

Also on August 21, 2012, Yeung created a Skype account in the name of “Mason

Zhang”, allowing him to have a phone number associated with the pseudonym.
B.

Yeung Organizes the EMPO Promotion.

53.

From August 22 (the day after he was given a Contrarian Press e-mail address)

through approximately September 2012, Yeung hired stock promoters to distribute the
promotional materials about EMPO supposedly authored by “Mason Zhang” by e-mail to their
subscribers. Yeung did not tell these promoters his real name, but instead held himself out as
“Mason Zhang” “VP of Marketing” at Contrarian Press. Yeung communicated with these
promoters through his “mz” Contrarian Press e-mail address.
54.

Yeung made no effort to hide from his Contrarian Press colleagues that he was

14 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 15 of 23

communicating with stock promoters to organize a promotional campaign or that, in doing so, he
was holding himself out as a Contrarian Press employee named Mason Zhang. For example,
Yeung copied colleagues at Contrarian Press on e-mails—using the Contrarian Press e-mail
address associated with Mason Zhang—in which he referred to himself as Mason Zhang.
55.

Moreover, Yeung kept Fraser apprised of his progress. At one point, for example,

Yeung went to Las Vegas to meet with Fraser and a stock promoter that he had hired for the
EMPO campaign. During that trip, Yeung discussed the EMPO promotion with Fraser.
C.

Crown Pacifica Media Services

56.

Yeung initially instructed the stock promoters to direct their invoices to

Contrarian Press, which many of them did.
57.

However, in order to further obscure Contrarian Press’s—and therefore Fraser’s

and EMPO’s—involvement with the latest EMPO promotional campaign, Fraser had his
personal assistant (“Personal Assistant”) create a new company, Crown Pacifica Media Services
(“Crown Pacifica”) in early October 2012. Crown Pacifica’s sole purpose was to create the
appearance that an entity other than Contrarian Press was organizing the EMPO promotion. To
that end, Crown Pacifica’s only business was to receive funds and to transfer those funds, as
payment, to the stock promoters that Yeung had already hired.
58.

Once Crown Pacifica was established, Yeung and the Personal Assistant asked the

stock promoters to re-issue their invoices—initially addressed to Contrarian Press—to Crown
Pacifica. In recognition of the fact that Crown Pacifica was nothing more than a straw man
meant to hide Contrarian Press’s and Fraser’s involvement in the campaign, Yeung sent an email to one promoter asking him to re-issue his invoice to Crown Pacifica to reflect “what should
be on paper.”

15 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 16 of 23

59.

To further obfuscate Contrarian Press’s role in organizing the promotional

campaign, in approximately late September, Yeung switched e-mail addresses from
“mz@contrarianpress.com” to a Gmail address still under the pseudonym “Mason Zhang.”
D.

The Promotional Campaign

60.

On August 29, 2012, Yeung asked two Contrarian Press employees to provide

him with an example of a past promotional campaign for EMPO that he could use as a model in
creating the new promotional materials. Later that day, and in response to Yeung’s request,
Fraser sent Yeung an e-mail containing copies of Red Rock’s May 2012 EMPO promotional
materials to use as model.
61.

Yeung then sent the stock promoters he had hired promotional materials that he

and others at Contrarian Press had created, one of which purported to be a newsletter from an
entity called “Aggressive Growth-Stock Screener.” Yeung also provided the third-party
promoters with the subject lines for the e-mails they would send to their subscribers. These
promotional materials, including the “Aggressive Growth-Stock Screener,” exhorted the reader
to purchase EMPO stock. For example, “Aggressive Growth-Stock Screener” was titled
EMPO: Empowered Products
	
Current EMPO around $1 with expanding value about $15 

Now is Your Chance to Buy Huge Asset-Growth Beforehand
	
62.

Those promotional materials contained disclaimers, which failed to accurately

disclose EMPO’s, Contrarian Press’s, or Fraser’s involvement in (and approval of) the
promotional campaign and materials, or EMPO’s involvement in paying Contrarian Press to
undertake promotional campaigns. For example, the Aggressive Growth-Stock Screener
newsletter contained a disclaimer:
Alpine View Media is providing a budget of $750,000 and this
report to Crown Pacifica to coordinate the distribution of this
featured report on Empowered Products Inc. . . . Empowered
16 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 17 of 23

Products Inc. has neither approved nor paid for this specific
advertisement.
63.

Yeung understood (or recklessly disregarded) that (a) he was undertaking the

promotion for Contrarian Press and Fraser and (b) Fraser ran both Contrarian Press and EMPO.
Therefore, Yeung knew (or recklessly disregarded) this disclaimer was false because it
disclaimed Contrarian Press’s, Fraser’s, and EMPO’s approval of and involvement in the
promotional campaign. Moreover, as discussed above, Fraser knew (or recklessly) disregarded
that the newsletter and the promotional campaign in general were deceptive because (a) Fraser
had hired Yeung to undertake the promotional campaign; (b) Fraser understood (or recklessly
disregarded) that Yeung was using a pseudonym; (c) Fraser had supplied Yeung with a model for
the promotional newsletters; and (d) Fraser understood (or recklessly disregarded) that Crown
Pacifica was merely a straw man to hide Contrarian Press’s management of the promotional
campaign.
64.

From approximately early October to mid-November 2012, the stock promoters

that Yeung hired sent e-mails to over 3 million prospective investors. None of these e-mails—
some of which contained links to the Aggressive Growth-Stock Screener newsletter that included
the misleading disclaimer set out above—accurately disclosed the involvement of EMPO,
Contrarian Press, or Faser in arranging the promotional campaign.
65.

Prior to this promotion, from September 4 to October 5, 2012, EMPO’s stock

price traded between $0.70 and $0.95 with an average daily trading volume of 681 shares per
day. During this promotional campaign, the price of EMPO shares increased to a high of $1.11
per share, with an average daily trading volume of 70,185 shares per day. After the promotional
campaign ended, the price of EMPO’s stock and average daily trading volume collapsed. By
November 30, 2012, EMPO’s stock closed at $0.32 per share, with an average daily trading
17 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 18 of 23

volume from November 15 to November 30, 2012 of 18,895 shares per day.
	
66.

In addition, further demonstrating Crown Pacifica’s role as straw man for the

campaign, in approximately November 2012, the Personal Assistant reimbursed herself
approximately $4,000 from Contrarian Press’s bank account for money she had advanced Crown
Pacifica to cover promotional expenses for the campaign.

VII.

67.

Following the promotion, Crown Pacifica never had any other business.

68.

Contrarian Press paid Yeung approximately $30,000 for his work.

Additional EMPO Promotions
69.

Fraser subsequently authored and posted to one of Contrarian Press’s websites

additional newsletters recommending EMPO’s business and stock. These newsletters were
likewise falsely presented as objective articles concerning the company and its prospects.
70.

On October 26 and November 21, 2012, Fraser authored and posted to Contrarian

Press’s website articles about EMPO under the pseudonym “Charlie Buck.” In these articles
Fraser recommended investing in EMPO. For example, he wrote:
Last week, I mentioned we’d be bringing you a pure-play microcap stock . . . and here it is: Empowered Products . . . . The stock
is currently trading around a buck, and we see the company as
well-positioned in a newly-emerging stock sector.
71.

Neither of these articles contained any disclaimer as to Fraser’s authorship, his

ownership of EMPO, or that EMPO was continuing to make monthly payments to Contrarian
Press under the Investors Relations Agreement.
72.

Moreover, Contrarian Press’s website to which Fraser posted these articles

contained a general disclaimer stating: “The publisher is not, and does not purport to be, a
registered investment adviser and did not accept compensation in return for this commentary.”
73.

This statement was false and misleading because, as Fraser and Contrarian Press
18 


Case 1:16-cv-06964 Document 1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 19 of 23

knew (or recklessly disregarded), it did not disclose (a) that Charlie Buck was a pseudonym for
Fraser; (b) that Fraser had authored the newsletters and was an officer of EMPO; or (c) that
EMPO was paying Contrarian Press under the Investor Relations Agreement.
