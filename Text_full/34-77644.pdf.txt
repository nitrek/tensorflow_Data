INTERNATIONAL, S.A.,
MICHAEL DOKTORCZYK,
and SHERRALYN BOLLES,
CPA,
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Logitech International, S.A. (“LOGI” or “the
Company”), Michael Doktorczyk (“Doktorcyzk”), and Sherralyn Bolles, CPA (“Bolles”)
(collectively, “Respondents”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Cease-and-Desist Orders and
Penalties (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
These proceedings arise out of, and this Order covers, recurring instances of improper
accounting in three separate areas at Logitech International, S.A. during a five-year period. The first
concerns LOGI’s actions and omissions in fraudulently accounting for the write-down of a failed
product in its fiscal year2 2011 (“FY11”) financial statements. The second relates to actions and
omissions by LOGI, Michael Doktorczyk, and Sherralyn Bolles concerning the accounting for the
Company’s warranty liabilities in the FY12 and FY13 financial statements, and concerning the
failure to correct, in the FY13 financial statements, a known error in not amortizing intangibles from
a prior acquisition. The third concerns books and records, reporting, and control violations by
LOGI pertaining to the Company’s revenue recognition in its Americas region in FY09.
Doktorczyk and Bolles, whose employment at LOGI began in July 2011 and July 2012,
respectively, were not involved in the first and third areas.

Accounting for Revue Product/Components
(Concerning the Company)

3

1.

In October 2010 (LOGI’s fiscal Q311), LOGI launched a product called “Revue,” a
set-top device that connected to televisions, allowing internet usage and video
streaming. Prior to launching Revue, LOGI had retained a contract manufacturer
(“CM”) in Asia to produce hundreds of thousands of units in anticipation of
demand during the year-end holidays. LOGI had also authorized the CM to
purchase millions of dollars of components to meet expected demand.

2.

From the outset, Revue sales were significantly below LOGI’s internal forecasts.
By late November 2010, sales and finance personnel, including senior executives,
were addressing whether the market price of $299 should be cut. LOGI’s CFO at
the time (“Former CFO”), and its acting controller (“Former Acting Controller”),
were aware that LOGI might have to evaluate taking a “lower of cost or market”
(“LCM”) charge if the value of Revue inventory was impaired.

3.

Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)3, the Company was
required to value its inventory at the lower of the inventory’s cost or market value.
Specifically, if the market value of a company’s inventory (generally calculated for
finished goods as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business,
less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation) is less
than its cost, then the company must write-down the inventory value in its financial
statements.

4.

On or around December 7, 2010, because of high inventory levels and weak sales,
LOGI directed CM to stop manufacturing Revue, including halting all work-inprogress. LOGI also instructed CM not to ship over 26,000 finished Revue units.
Further, because CM, at LOGI’s direction, had purchased parts for future
manufacturing, LOGI was liable for approximately $11 million of excess
components.

5.

At the end of Q311 (December 31, 2010), Revue sales were only 40% of LOGI’s
forecasts for that product. As part of its Q311 financial closing process, LOGI
performed an LCM analysis of the Revue finished goods inventory and concluded
that no adjustment, or write-down, was required.

6.

On or around January 5, 2011, LOGI’s Senior Vice-President of Operations (SVPOperations) informed several executives that he intended to “dispose of the
components” awaiting assembly by CM in light of Revue’s “current trajectory.”
Shortly thereafter, the SVP-Operations instructed the VP of Global
Sourcing/Supplier Management (VP-Global Sourcing) to “sell all of the
components we could.”

7.

Later in January 2011, LOGI management informed the Board of Directors about
the poor sales of Revue and about management’s future plans for the product,
including a plan to lower the retail price of Revue to $249 in Q112, and to $199 in
Q312. Management did not inform its independent auditor of this pricing plan
strategy.

8.

On January 27, 2011, LOGI issued its Q311 earnings release, reporting strong
results, increasing its guidance for annual revenue for fiscal year-end March 31,
2011, and affirming its guidance for annual operating income in a range of $170M$180M.

9.

During LOGI’s fiscal Q411, Revue sales continued to be far below projections. For
all of Q411, despite regular discounting and promotions, Revue sales were 30% of
internal product forecasts. By quarter-end, retailers were selling fewer than 1,000
Revue units per week.

10.

At the end of Q411, LOGI had over 163,000 units of Revue finished inventory in
its US distribution centers, with another 52,000 finished and work-in-progress units
in Asia. Based on the sales rate for Q411, LOGI had well over a year’s supply of
Revue. At the quarter-end sales rate to retailers, LOGI had over three years of
inventory.

11.

In mid-March 2011, an accountant in LOGI’s Regional Finance area asked LOGI’s
VP-Global Sourcing about financial risk for the Revue product and the number of
units that could be built from on-hand components. The VP-Global Sourcing
informed her that there was no plan to use the components and that Global Sourcing
was attempting to sell whatever could be sold. He also noted: “If we need to scrap
[work-in-progress] and components, we should assume a recoverable value of
zero.”

12.

On or around March 23, 2011, a LOGI Finance employee sent the Former Acting
Controller a summary of potential excess and obsolete inventory for contract
manufacturers in preparation for a meeting the next day to discuss required
accounting adjustments for the year-end financials. The summary highlighted a
total potential excess inventory of $19.4M for Revue units and components that
“should be reserved.”

13.

On March 31, 2011, LOGI announced that, for reasons unrelated to Revue, it would
miss the guidance it had provided to the market two months earlier. LOGI lowered
the previous guidance for operating income by $30M (to a range of $140M$150M). Internally, the CEO characterized the guidance miss as a “disaster” and
informed his executive team, including the Former CFO, that management’s
credibility with the market was damaged.
4

14.

For its FY11 year-end financial close process, LOGI initially prepared an LCM
analysis indicating that no LCM adjustment was required for Revue finished goods
inventory. The company’s independent auditor arranged separate meetings with
LOGI’s Former CFO and Former Acting Controller to discuss the importance of
the assumptions in the LCM analysis. In the meetings, the independent auditor
stressed the need to consider future pricing assumptions and strategies. Within
days, LOGI revised the LCM analysis and, based on a planned price cut to $249 in
Q112, recorded a $2.2M adjustment. However, in the revised analysis, LOGI did
not account for the planned Q312 price cut to $199, nor did LOGI consider the
excess component inventory.

15.

After receiving the revised LCM with the $2.2 million adjustment, the independent
auditor noted the roughly $11 million of excess component inventory and informed
the Former Acting Controller and Regional Finance that LOGI was also required to
evaluate and, if necessary, record an adjustment for the component inventory.

16.

LOGI’s Regional Finance accountant resisted adjusting for the component
inventory. When the independent auditor persisted, Regional Finance again
emailed the VP-Global Sourcing, notifying him there was “heated discussion” with
the independent auditor about Revue, and asking him to determine the number of
Revue units that could be built from the component inventory.

17.

The VP-Global Sourcing, who was responsible for managing the component
inventory liability, informed Regional Finance and the Former Acting Controller
that production had been stopped for months and that he did not “see a chance that
we are ever going to build [the components] into units.” He wrote that a build-out
of components was a “far fetched scenario that has never been formulated.” He
also explained that, at the direction of the SVP-Operations, “we have been working
since January to resell component liabilities” with only modest success: “the easiest
stuff to resell . . . is moving at 40-50 cts on the dollar maximum. For the rest of
components, we should assume 25cts on the dollar of recovery, the rest will be a
hard loss.”

18.

The Former Acting Controller forwarded the information to the Former CFO, who
asked about the potential exposure if the information was correct. In her reply to
the Former CFO, the Former Acting Controller suggested that, by assuming the
excess components would be built into finished goods, LOGI could reduce the
amount it would have to write-down. There was no basis for any such assumption.

19.

The Former CFO replied: “Yes, we need to understand with precision what we are
looking at and what decisions we need to make or clarify. We are still committed
to making the right decisions and staying within our lowered range for Q4—we
need to achieve them both.”
5

20.

On the next day (April 18, 2011), the Former Acting Controller received a detailed
list of the excess components. Less than an hour later, she sent a spreadsheet
containing an LCM component analysis to the independent auditor, calculating an
adjustment of $1.1M, based on a hypothetical build-out of 79,000 additional
finished units of Revue. The Former Acting Controller ignored the fact
(communicated to her two days earlier) that LOGI had been actively attempting to
sell all of the components, with only limited success and below cost. Instead, she
based the Company’s accounting on a “far fetched scenario.”

21.

On or around April 18, 2011, after forwarding the component LCM analysis
spreadsheet to the independent auditor, the Former Acting Controller met with
members of the independent audit team. At that meeting, the Former Acting
Controller discussed LOGI’s plans to use the $11 million of excess components to
build 79,000 finished Revue units. She also represented that LOGI could use
excess components (beyond what was needed to make 79,000 Revue units) to
manufacture even more Revue units. The Former Acting Controller’s
representations were false.

22.

During the week of April 18, 2011, the Former Acting Controller and Former CFO
met with senior members of the independent audit team. In those meetings the
Former Acting Controller and Former CFO confirmed the assumptions used in the
LCM analyses, and represented that LOGI was committed to the Revue product for
the long-term and was going to build at least 79,000 additional units using excess
components. These representations were false.

23.

At the time the representations were made, the Former Acting Controller and
Former CFO knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that LOGI had no plan to
produce additional units of Revue. They knew, or were reckless in not knowing,
that CM had not shipped any Revue units since late November 2010, and had
stopped production in early December 2010. In fact, they knew, or were reckless in
not knowing, that LOGI had no timetable for re-starting production or even for
completing the work-in-progress units and, for months, had been attempting to sell
excess component inventory at substantial discounts.

24.

On or around May 27, 2011, the Former Acting Controller and Former CFO signed
a management representation letter to the independent audit firm. The letter
contained material misrepresentations concerning the valuation of inventory and the
LCM analysis for Revue inventory. Specifically, with respect to the Revue LCM
analysis, the letter represented that “we considered future pricing
adjustments/discounts which are probable of occurring.” This representation was
false because the LCM analysis did not consider the planned price drop to $199 in
Q312 or other discounting or promotions that would likely be required to sell the
excess finished goods inventory.
6

25.

The Former Acting Controller and Former CFO knew, or were reckless in not
knowing, that the representations in the management representation letter
concerning inventory valuation and the LCM analysis were false. Prior to including
the language on LCM and inventory valuation in the representation letter, the
independent audit team had made both the Former Acting Controller and Former
CFO aware of the importance of considering future pricing in the LCM analysis.
As LOGI acknowledged in its November 2014 restatement, the Company had not
considered future pricing adjustments/discounts that were probable of occurring.
The LCM analysis provided to the independent audit firm, and which the Former
Acting Controller and Former CFO discussed with the auditor, did not address—or
account for—LOGI’s plan to lower the price to $199 in or before Q312.

26.

On May 27, 2011, LOGI filed its Form 10-K with the Commission. The Former
CFO signed the Form 10-K as the Company’s CFO and Principal Accounting
Officer. LOGI reported operating income of $142.7M, which was within the
lowered range of $140M-$150M that LOGI had communicated to investors on
March 31, 2011.

27.

On November 14, 2014, LOGI restated its financial results for FY11 and FY12
because of errors in the timing of the Revue-related inventory write-downs. At the
time it initially filed its FY11 financial statements, LOGI overstated its operating
income by $30.7M, i.e., over 27%. If LOGI had properly accounted for Revuerelated inventory in May 2011, it would have reported operating income of
approximately $112M, far below the lowered guidance of $140M-$150M.
Warranty Accrual Accounting
(Concerning the Company, Doktorczyk, and Bolles)

28.

Historically, LOGI divided its operations into three geographical regions: Americas
(AMR); Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia-Pacific/Japan (APJ).
LOGI offered warranties on its products sold throughout the world. Depending
upon the particular country and type of product, the warranties ranged from one to
five years.4 In FY09, after its independent auditor raised the need to accrue for its
warranty liability, LOGI began recording a liability in its books and records.

29.

In the latter part of FY09, accountants within LOGI, including the same Former
Acting Controller, developed a warranty accrual model for the AMR region based
on the assumption that, if a product failed, it would fail quickly and be returned
within one quarter. The Company did not have a basis for this assumption, nor did it
have sufficient data to evaluate such an assumption. The warranty model also did

4

The need to account for contingent liabilities, including liability for future product warranty claims, was addressed
in SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Pertaining to warranties in particular, SFAS 5 was codified as ASC 46010-25, Product Warranties.

7

not consider when the warranty liability began (i.e., when products were purchased
by end-users) or when the liability ended (i.e., one, two, or five years after purchase
of a product by the end-user). This model was shared with the independent auditors.
30.

From FY08 through FY11, the deficiencies of LOGI’s AMR model—and the need
for a more robust method—were known within LOGI’s finance and accounting
groups. During FY10, LOGI’s then-controller noted that the Company’s warranty
model was “not good” because it was not based on the total number of products
under warranty in the hands of consumers. Despite this recognition, LOGI
continued to use the model to record the warranty liability.

31.

During LOGI’s FY12, a senior accountant was assigned to provide operational input
on LOGI’s warranty in the AMR region. The senior accountant reviewed the model
and could not understand the reason or basis for various discretionary inputs or the
underlying assumptions. She also discovered that the model did not take into
account the length of the product warranty term. Specifically, the senior accountant
determined that, if LOGI were to change its warranty term (e.g., increase the length
of the warranty from one-year to three-years), the model’s calculated exposure (i.e.,
the required accrual) would not change. In other words, the model calculated the
same warranty accrual regardless of whether products carried a three-month
warranty or a 10-year warranty.

32.

The senior accountant inquired but could not get an explanation or basis for the
inputs or why changing the warranty term would not impact the calculated accrual.
The senior accountant also realized that the model did not use “sell-through data”
(data on product sales to consumers). Although she lacked expertise in warranty
accounting, she concluded that the Company’s warranty accrual model did not
comply with GAAP.

33.

In Q312, the senior accountant developed a new, more robust “waterfall” model
despite having only limited historical sales and return data available to her. Using
the new model, she estimated that the Company was under-reserved by several
million dollars. She reported her findings to her supervisor, who arranged a meeting
with Doktorczyk (the controller).

34.

Since at least 2004, LOGI’s finance and accounting groups and senior management
used a quarterly “exposure list” to keep track of significant recorded entries,
potential exposures or charges, reclassifications, and other items. LOGI’s finance
and accounting groups did not share the exposure list with its independent auditor.
In Q312, the warranty accrual was added to the list as a “potential exposure,” with
the amount of exposure “TBD” [to-be-decided]. The warranty accrual remained on
the list as a “potential exposure” for six more quarters.

8

5

35.

On or around December 21, 2011 (the end of Q312), the senior accountant presented
her conclusions to Doktorczyk, the Former Acting Controller, and others. In the
presentation, the senior accountant set forth the deficiencies with the existing model
and indicated a likely under-accrual of $3.4M. Doktorczyk did not ensure that
deficiencies in the model were corrected.

36.

Five months later, in May 2012, as part of the Company’s internal accounting
controls, the senior accountant was asked to confirm5 the accuracy of certain
statements, one of which included language about the Company’s warranty
provisions. Because she believed the warranty accrual did not comply with GAAP,
the senior accountant refused to confirm or certify the statement. The senior
accountant’s refusal to confirm or certify the statement about the warranty
provisions was not raised with, and accordingly was not acted upon by, Doktorczyk.

37.

Bolles started at LOGI in Q213. In Q313, an accountant in Financial Planning and
Analysis (FP&A) became responsible for calculating the warranty accrual. She
noted the same problems, and came to the same conclusion, as the senior accountant.
When the FP&A accountant studied the existing AMR warranty model, she could
not understand the basis for the inputs and assumptions, and attempted,
unsuccessfully, to get an explanation of the AMR model’s inputs and rationale.

38.

In Q313, the FP&A accountant also discovered that the warranty accrual models for
the Company’s other regions (EMEA and APJ) were different than the AMR model.
In addition, she determined that LOGI had not updated its warranty accrual
calculation in its EMEA region for the two prior quarters because the person who
had previously done the calculation had been laid off and no one could find the
model. Bolles was informed about the lack of any support for the EMEA
calculation.

39.

By the end of Q313, the FP&A accountant had concluded that LOGI’s warranty
accrual, as computed with the existing model, was not appropriate under GAAP.
She informed Doktorczyk and Bolles about the significant problems with the
warranty accrual calculation, and asked for technical accounting assistance.

40.

To assist the FP&A accountant, Bolles assigned the senior accountant who a year
earlier had concluded that the existing model did not calculate a warranty accrual
that was GAAP-compliant. At the end of Q313, a meeting was scheduled with the
independent auditor to discuss the warranty accrual methodology. Shortly before the
meeting, Bolles postponed it. The meeting never occurred. According to the FP&A
accountant, the meeting was cancelled because the corporate accounting group did
“not want to rock the boat . . . at this time with a revised warranty methodology.”

This was a sub-certification process that LOGI had implemented.

9

41.

In mid-Q413, the supervisor of the FP&A accountant arranged a meeting with
LOGI’s Former CFO. One purpose of the meeting was to address the concerns with
the warranty model, the range of additional exposure reflected by a modified
methodology, and to “share with [LOGI’s Former CFO] our understanding of
whether the issue can be contained to FY13 or not.”

42.

On or about February 14, 2013, LOGI’s top finance and accounting officers—
LOGI’s Former CFO, Doktorczyk, Bolles, and the VP of FP&A, as well as the
senior accountant and FP&A accountant, attended a meeting at which the senior
accountant presented her findings regarding the warranty model issues and concerns,
much like the presentation she had made 14 months earlier. The senior accountant
told LOGI’s Former CFO that the existing warranty accrual model was not GAAPcompliant.

43.

The February 2013 presentation was explicit about the deficiencies in the current
model and the estimated amount of additional exposure: $4.2M. The presentation
also set forth two options for transitioning to a new model: a one-time switch in
methodology or a “gradual change to existing approach.” The first option would
result in an immediate charge or “catch up adjustment” to LOGI’s financial results.
The second option would “change the current model gradually to increase reserves
until [the] catch up entry is not material before switching the model.” The second
option was not GAAP-compliant.

44.

At the direction of LOGI’s Former CFO, the Company implemented the second
option—the plan to gradually increase the reserve. Specifically, the Company
planned for, and added, $1M to its warranty accrual for Q413. The Company added
the $1M in Q413 by manipulating certain formulas in its existing warranty accrual
model. The Company also planned to add $1M per quarter for the first three
quarters of FY14.

45.

Despite the warranty accrual remaining as a “potential exposure” item on the
exposure list for six quarters, neither LOGI’s Former CFO nor any LOGI accountant
informed the Company’s independent auditor about the under-accrual or the
problems with the existing model for over a year and a half, during which time
LOGI filed four Forms 10-Q and two Forms 10-K.

46.

Toward the end of Q413, the senior accountant also discovered that LOGI
apparently had not amortized certain intangibles from a FY10 acquisition. The
senior accountant informed Bolles of the potential error in March 2013, over two
months before the filing of the FY13 Form 10-K. The potential amortization error,
which was estimated at approximately $1.87M, was also added as a “potential
exposure” item on the finance and accounting groups’ exposure list.

10

47.

No later than April 2013, Bolles was aware that her staff, which included the senior
accountant, had researched the intangibles issue and concluded that the Company
had failed to amortize certain intangibles. Bolles did not cause the error to be
corrected in FY13 or inform the independent auditor about it before the filing of the
Form 10-K.

48.

On May 30, 2013, LOGI filed its Form 10-K for FY13, which contained material
misstatements and omissions about the Company’s product warranty accruals. In
particular, LOGI misstated the amount of its product warranty liability by over
$17.2M.

49.

LOGI’s Former CFO resigned from LOGI in April 2013. Doktorczyk was asked to
become the Company’s principal financial officer and principal accounting officer,
and he signed the Form 10-K in that capacity approximately two weeks later. At the
time he signed the Form 10-K, Doktorczyk knew, or should have known, about two
accounting errors/exposures that the Company had failed to correct in its books and
records and about which the Company had failed to inform its independent auditor.

50.

On May 30, 2013, Doktorczyk and Bolles signed a letter to the Company’s audit
firm representing that “there were no material transactions, agreements or accounts
that have not been properly recorded in the accounting records underlying the
consolidated financial statements.” The materiality threshold in the letter was
$500K. At the time they signed the letter, Doktorczyk and Bolles knew, or should
have known, about two issues—additional warranty accrual exposure (estimated to
be $4.2M at the time) and failure to amortize intangibles (approx. $1.87M) —that
exceeded the letter’s materiality threshold and had not been properly recorded in the
Company’s books and records.

51.

On May 30, 2013, Doktorczyk certified that the Form 10-K did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were
made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by the Form 10-K.
Doktorczyk also certified that the financial statements, and other financial
information in the Form 10-K, fairly presented in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of LOGI for the period reported. At
the time he signed the certification, Doktorczyk knew, or should have known, of the
errors/exposures concerning the warranty accrual and failure to amortize intangibles,
and the effect of those errors/exposures on the financial statements and results of
operations.

52.

Prior to the filing of the Company’s Form 10-K in May 2013, Bolles knew, or
should have known, that LOGI’s internal accounting controls with respect to its
warranty accrual were insufficient. Bolles was not only aware of deficiencies with
the AMR warranty model, but also knew, or should have known, that LOGI had
11

inadequate accounting controls over its warranty reserve in the EMEA region. No
later than January 2013, she had been informed that LOGI had not updated its
warranty accrual calculation for two consecutive quarters in the EMEA region and,
thus, she knew, or should have known, the Company did not have an adequate basis
for the reserves it had recorded in those quarters.
53.

The misstatements and omissions with respect to the warranty accrual were
material. At the end of FY12, LOGI reserved $5.2M for its warranty obligations
and reported net income of $71.5M. Using an appropriate methodology (i.e., the
model that LOGI subsequently proposed and adopted), the Company should have
reserved $25.5M -- an under-accrual of over $21M. Similarly, in FY13, LOGI’s
accrual was over $17M lower than the GAAP-compliant model required.

54.

On August 7, 2013, LOGI filed an amended Form 10-K for FY13, disclosing and
correcting the warranty accrual and amortization expense errors, revising its
financial statements for FY09 through FY13, and correcting its reporting on internal
control.
Revenue Recognition in AMR
(Concerning the Company)

55.

From late FY08 through FY09, LOGI improperly recognized revenue for sales to
its largest wholesale distributor (Distributor) in the AMR region.

56.

Historically, in its AMR region, most of LOGI’s sales were to wholesale
distributors and large retailers. For most sales, including those to Distributor, LOGI
recognized revenue at the time it shipped products (net of reserves for estimated
returns, incentives, price protection, and promotional programs). This method of
revenue recognition is frequently called “sell-in.”

57.

Under GAAP6, to recognize revenue based on “sell-in,” LOGI had to meet certain
criteria, including: LOGI’s price to Distributor had to be substantially fixed or
determinable at the time of sale, LOGI had to transfer the risks and rewards of
product ownership (principally, risk of loss) to Distributor, LOGI could not have
any significant obligation to bring about the resale of the product, and LOGI had to
be reasonably assured that it could collect payment from the seller.

58.

If LOGI could not meet the criteria for “sell-in” revenue recognition, then GAAP
required the Company to recognize revenue only when it had met all the required
criteria in GAAP, which was generally when the wholesale distributor (or retailer)
sold the product to the next reseller (or end user) in the distribution chain.

6

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48 (“SFAS 48”), Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists, which specifies the criteria a company must meet to recognize revenue at time of sale. This was subsequently
codified into the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) as ASC 605-15-25 for FY10 and later.

12

59.

By the end of FY08, and through FY09, the facts and circumstances of LOGI’s
relationship with Distributor required LOGI to recognize revenue based upon “sellthrough.” Nevertheless, throughout FY09, the Company continued to recognize
revenue from Distributor based upon “sell-in.”
Logitech’s Course of Dealing with Distributor

60.

From at least FY07 though FY09, LOGI consistently made large end-of-quarter
sales to Distributor in a “hockey stick” pattern: modest sales in the first two months,
with a sharp increase in sales in the quarter’s final weeks.

61.

In order to encourage Distributor to purchase excess product, LOGI provided
incentives to reach quarterly purchase thresholds, provided discounts for bulk
container sales, and gave discounts for large, lump-sum payments of overdue
invoices at quarter-end.

62.

To meet its sales numbers, LOGI sold excess quantities of certain products to
Distributor with the understanding that LOGI would assist Distributor in selling the
products or would allow Distributor to return the products outside of the return
period or in excess of the contractual return rights. When Distributor returned
products, LOGI credited the full invoice price and allowed Distributor to keep the
incentives and discounts.

63.

Because of LOGI’s selling significant amounts of lower-demand goods, Distributor
had excess inventory of LOGI product and, as a result, withheld payment until
LOGI provided a plan for reducing Distributor’s inventory. Although Distributor
had title to the inventory, Distributor considered the inventory to be “owned” only
if it had paid LOGI for that inventory.

64.

To facilitate payment of past-due invoices, LOGI negotiated discounts based, in
part, on Distributor’s amount of “owned” inventory. During FY09, LOGI gave
Distributor nearly $3M in such discounts. Although LOGI had established a
pattern of offering and negotiating these end-of-quarter payment discounts going
back to FY07, LOGI did not accrue for them at the time of sale/shipment.

65.

Distributor viewed the discounts as “owned” inventory discounts that were intended
to compensate Distributor for its carrying costs of excess inventory. LOGI’s
practice of using discounts to obtain payment of past-due invoices and negotiating
discounts based, in part, on “owned” inventory levels was inconsistent with the
GAAP requirement that the price at the time of sale be fixed or determinable.

13

LOGI’s Attempts to Alleviate Excess Inventory Levels at Distributor
66.

Given the facts and circumstances of its business with Distributor, LOGI should
have recognized revenue using the “sell-through” model no later than Q408.
Instead, in FY09, LOGI attempted to alleviate the large build-up of inventory by
finding buyers for Distributor’s excess inventory, arranging “sideways”
transactions, and allowing Distributor to return excess amounts of product. In
effect, LOGI treated Distributor as an additional warehouse for inventory.

67.

Throughout FY09, LOGI assisted Distributor in finding buyers for the excess
inventory that Distributor had purchased under generous incentives.

68.

Despite Distributor’s elevated inventories of LOGI product, LOGI continued to
make large end-of-quarter sales to Distributor in FY09, selling some products even
though Distributor already had excess quantities.

69.

In Q209 and Q309, in an effort to reduce Distributor’s inventory, LOGI authorized
extra-contractual returns and arranged “sideways” transactions or “channel to
channel” sales, in which LOGI would find a purchaser, have the product returned or
transferred from Distributor’s warehouse, and insulate Distributor from losing
money on the sale. In Q209 and Q309, LOGI also accepted millions of dollars of
excess returns from Distributor. LOGI characterized some of the returns as
“sideways” transactions, claiming that the Company needed the inventory to satisfy
a customer in another of its channels, and requesting that Distributor return the
product.

70.

LOGI actively sought buyers for Distributor’s inventory at lower prices than
Distributor had paid, and then protected Distributor from losing money on the
transactions. Specifically, LOGI credited Distributor at the original invoice price
for the extra-contractual returns and then re-sold the product at lower prices.

71.

Despite LOGI’s efforts to reduce Distributor’s inventory levels, Distributor still had
excessive inventory of LOGI product in late FY09. As a result, LOGI and
Distributor negotiated a special return of $12.5M of products, much of which LOGI
had sold to Distributor over a year earlier. LOGI scrapped some of that product
shortly after it was returned.

72.

Along with the other concessions LOGI gave to Distributor in FY09, the special
return was an indication that LOGI should not have recognized revenue on sales to
Distributor upon “sell-in” in FY 09. Instead, GAAP required that LOGI recognize
revenue from Distributor only upon Distributor’s sale of the product.

73.

If LOGI had switched to a “sell-through” model for Distributor at the beginning of
FY09, as required by GAAP (assuming all general revenue recognition criteria
14

were achieved upon “sell-through”), LOGI’s gross sales would have been $52M
lower in FY09. Given LOGI’s reported operating income of $109M and gross
margins of 31.3%, LOGI materially overstated its operating income by
approximately $16.2M in FY09, as a result of its improperly recognizing revenue
from Distributor.

Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this
action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such
a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the
amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related
Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of
one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

17

V.
It is further Ordered that, for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 523 of

Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
