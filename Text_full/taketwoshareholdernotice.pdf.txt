SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,

No. 1:07-cv-1075-DLC

NOTICE OF PLAN OF ALLOCATION FOR
DISTRIBUTION OF APPROXIMATELY $6.5 MILLION TO
SHAREHOLDERS OF TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE , INC.
THIS NOTICE RELATES TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF APPROXIMATELY $6.5
MILLION IN FUNDS RECOVERED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION (THE “SEC”) IN A CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ACTION ENTITLED SEC v.
RYAN ASHLEY BRANT, CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:07-cv-1075-DLC (S.D.N.Y.)(THE “SEC
ACTION”). THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES THE PROPOSED PLAN OF ALLOCATION FOR
THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS AND PROVIDES SHAREHOLDERS OF TAKE-TWO
INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. (“TAKE-TWO”) WITH A THIRTY-DAY PERIOD IN
WHICH TO COMMENT OR OBJECT TO THE PROPOSED PLAN OF ALLOCATION.
THIS NOTICE EXPLAINS IMPORTANT RIGHTS YOU MIGHT HAVE AS A
SHAREHOLDER OR FORMER SHAREHOLDER OF TAKE-TWO, INCLUDING YOUR
POSSIBLE RECEIPT OF A CASH PAYMENT AS A RESULT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF
FUNDS.
In February 2007, the SEC filed and simultaneously settled charges against Ryan Brant
for his alleged role in a stock options backdating scheme at Take-Two. Brant, the former Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of Take-Two, consented to an injunction and a permanent
officer and director bar and agreed to pay $6,261,606 to the Registry of the Court. This amount
consisted of Brant’s disgorgement of his “in-the-money” benefit from options backdating
($4,118,093), plus prejudgment interest thereon ($1,143,513), and payment of a penalty ($1
million). Now in the amount of approximately $6.5 million because of the accumulation of
interest, this money is maintained in an account over which the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York has control (the “Fund”).
The SEC has requested that the Court authorize the distribution of the Fund jointly with a
distribution in a class action pending against Take-Two, Brant and others, In re Take-Two
Interactive Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 1:06-cv-803-RJS (S.D.N.Y.), which would
provide for the distribution of $20,115,000, together with interest thereon, less attorneys’ fees,

expenses and costs of administration, to class members (the “Class Action Fund”). The class
action alleges stock options backdating as well as misstatements and omissions in connection
with the inclusion of sexually explicit material in Take-Two’s then-premier product, Grand Theft
Auto: San Andreas. The period covered by the class action is December 17, 2002 through July
10, 2006 (the “Class Period”), whereas the period of backdating in the SEC Action extends from
February 6, 1998 through July 10, 2006 (the “Claims Period”). The Fund will be distributed,
according to the plan of allocation described below, to all eligible Take-Two shareholders who
purchased stock in the period from February 6, 1998 through July 10, 2006 and still owned stock
at the end of that period.
The SEC alleges that the misrepresentations and omissions in connection with stock
options backdating at Take-Two were first made on February 6, 1998. The misrepresentations
and omissions are alleged to have been corrected by disclosures made on July 10, 2006.
The Fund is allocated between the Class Period and the period from February 6, 1998
through December 16, 2002 (the “SEC-Only Period”), on the basis of the relative number of
“damaged shares” calculated by Forensic Economics, Inc. to have been purchased in each such
period. According to Forensic Economics, approximately 25.6 percent of the total damaged
shares purchased in the Claims Period were purchased in the SEC-Only Period, resulting in an
allocation of approximately $1.6 million to the SEC-Only Period. The remaining approximately
$4.9 million of the Fund is allocated to the damaged shares purchased in the Class Period.
Class counsel, Forensic Economics and the SEC have calculated the amounts of losses
per share caused as a result of the alleged stock options backdating at issue in the SEC Action,
weighted according to the relative strength of such claims and the amount of the Fund available
to be awarded, as follows: (1) with respect to the options backdating claim in the SEC-Only
Period, $0.17 per share; and (2) with respect to the options backdating claim in the Class Period,
$0.73 per share (all calculated on a split-adjusted basis).
For authorized claimants who made multiple purchases, other acquisitions or sales of
Take-Two common stock during the Claims Period, sales must first be matched with purchases
during or prior to the Claims Period. The plan of allocation performs this matching using a
standard, first-in first-out methodology.
Each authorized claimant’s total “Inflation Loss” is calculated as the number of shares
purchased or otherwise acquired in the Claims Period, multiplied by the difference between the
applicable inflation per share on the date of purchase or acquisition and the applicable inflation
per share on the date of sale (if any), for each set of matched transactions. If the Inflation Loss
for a set of matched transactions is a negative amount, such negative amount represents an
“Inflation Profit” that will be offset against Inflation Losses from other sets of matched
transactions.
Each authorized claimant’s total “Trading Loss” for each set of matched transactions and
retained shares is calculated as the number of shares purchased or otherwise acquired in the
Claims Period multiplied by the difference between the purchase price per share, and: (1) if sold
or disposed of in the Claims Period, the sale price per share; or (2) if retained through the end of

2

the Claims Period, the closing price of Take-Two common stock on the last day of the Claims
Period. If the Trading Loss from this calculation results in a negative amount, such negative
amount represents a “Trading Profit” that will be offset against Trading Losses from other sets of
matched transactions.
An authorized claimant’s total Recognized Loss for purposes of the distribution of the
Fund is the lesser of the total Inflation Loss as calculated above and the total Trading Loss as
calculated above.
For purposes of calculating Recognized Loss, the date of purchase or sale is the
“contract” or “trade” date as distinguished from the “settlement” date. The determination of the
price received per share and the price paid per share is exclusive of commissions, taxes, fees and
charges. Any person who sold Take-Two common stock “short” will have no Recognized Loss
with respect to any purchase during the Class Period to cover such short sale. However, to the
extent that any purchase during the Class Period to cover a short sale resulted in an Inflation
Profit or a Trading Profit, such transaction will be taken into account when calculating an
authorized claimant’s total Recognized Loss.
If the Fund equals or is greater than the total Recognized Loss of all authorized claimants,
then each authorized claimant will receive an amount equal to the authorized claimant’s
Recognized Loss. If, however, the Fund is less than the total Recognized Loss of all authorized
claimants, then each authorized claimant will be paid the percentage of the Fund that each
authorized claimant’s Recognized Loss bears to the total of the Recognized Losses of all
authorized claimants. As such, each authorized claimant will receive a pro rata share of the
Fund. If the Fund is greater than the total Recognized Loss of all authorized claimants, then after
the distribution is complete and all taxes and court-ordered fees and expenses have been paid, the
remaining portion of the Fund will be transferred to the SEC for deposit into the United States
Treasury. The Court has reserved jurisdiction to allow, disallow, or adjust the Recognized Loss
of any authorized claimant on equitable grounds.
The Court has reserved the right to modify the plan of allocation without further notice to
authorized claimants. Payment pursuant to the plan of allocation approved by the Court shall be
conclusive against all authorized claimants.
If you would like to comment on or object to the proposed plan of distribution, you
must file your comments or objections in writing with the Court no later than January 15,
2010. Please mail your comments or objections to: United States District Court, Southern
District of New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York,
