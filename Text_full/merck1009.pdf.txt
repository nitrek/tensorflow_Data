QUESTIONS PRESENTED

The federal statute of limitations for private securities-fraud actions provides that a plaintiff must file suit
within “[two] years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation,” but not later than “[five] years
after such violation.” 28 U.S.C. 1658(b)(1) and (2). The
lower courts have uniformly construed the term “discovery” in that provision to encompass constructive as well
as actual discovery, so that suit must be filed within two
years after the plaintiff, in the exercise of reasonable
diligence, ought to have discovered the “facts constituting the violation.” The point at which the plaintiff was
sufficiently alerted to the possibility of wrongdoing that
a reasonably diligent investor in his position would have
undertaken further investigation is commonly referred
to as “inquiry notice.” The questions presented are as
follows:
1. Whether, when the two-year limitations period is
triggered by constructive discovery, the period begins to
run when the plaintiff is first placed on “inquiry notice,”
or only after an investor who has previously been placed
on inquiry notice should have discovered the violation by
way of a diligent investigation.
2. Whether a potential plaintiff is on “inquiry notice” of possible fraud in violation of the securities laws
whenever he suspects that the defendant has made a
false statement, or only when he has reason to suspect
that the defendant made the misstatement with the scienter necessary to constitute a violation of the securities
laws.

Argument:
This action is timely because respondents neither
knew, nor reasonably could have known, the facts
constituting petitioners’ alleged Section 10(b)
violation more than two years before filing suit . . . . . . . . 10

run only after the plaintiff discovers or should
have discovered facts demonstrating that all
elements of a securities-fraud violation can be
established . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11
1.	 The term “facts constituting the violation” in

2.	 Section 1658(b)(1)’s two-year limitations
period can be triggered by either actual or
constructive discovery of the “facts constituting the violation,” but is not triggered
by mere suspicion of illegality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15
3.	 Even if the plaintiff fails to undertake a
reasonably diligent investigation after
inquiry notice, the two-year limitations
period runs from when such an investigation
would have revealed the “facts constituting
the violation,” not from when the investigation should have commenced . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI

FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT


BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS


INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES


This case concerns the proper application of 28
U.S.C. 1658(b), the federal statute of limitations for private securities-fraud claims. Meritorious private securities-fraud actions are an essential supplement to criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement actions brought
by the United States and the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). The government therefore has a
strong interest in Section 1658(b)’s proper construction.
At the Court’s invitation, the United States previously
filed a brief amicus curiae in Trainer Wortham & Co. v.
Betz, petition for cert. pending, No. 07-1489 (filed May
27, 2008), which raised substantially similar issues.

STATEMENT

1. Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (1934 Act) makes it unlawful to “use or employ, in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security
* * * , any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of ” rules and regulations prescribed by the SEC. 15 U.S.C. 78j(b). The SEC’s Rule
10b-5 implements Section 10(b) by declaring it unlawful,
“in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,” to (a) “employ any device, scheme, or artifice to
defraud”; (b) “make any untrue statement of a material
fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made * * * not misleading”; or
(c) “engage in any act, practice, or course of business
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon any person.” 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5.
This Court has construed Section 10(b) to afford an
implied right of action. See, e.g., Dura Pharm., Inc. v.
Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341 (2005). In order to establish
a Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 violation, a private plaintiff
must prove the defendant made a material misrepresentation or omission with scienter—“a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.”
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 194 n.12
(1976). To recover under the implied cause of action, a
plaintiff must show, beyond a securities violation, that
he relied on the defendant’s misrepresentation and suffered economic loss as a result. Dura, 544 U.S. at 341342. In the absence of an express statute of limitations,
this Court held in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350 (1991) (Lampf ), that
Section 10(b) claims must be brought within the earlier
of one year “after the discovery of the facts constituting
the violation” or three years after the violation, id. at

3

364. The Court borrowed that language from limitations
periods Congress had provided for express causes of
action under the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), 15
U.S.C. 77a et seq., and the 1934 Act. Lampf, 501 U.S. at
359-360 & nn.6-7, 364 n.9 (citing 15 U.S.C. 77m, 78i(e),
78r(c)).
Congress adopted the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), Pub. L. No. 104-67, 109
Stat. 737, in response to the problem of abusive private
securities litigation, including plaintiff lawyers’ “race to
the courthouse” after only “minimal time preparing complaints,” often based on no more than a stock-price drop
or “a failed product development project,” S. Rep. No.
98, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 8, 10-11 (1995). See H.R.
Conf. Rep. No. 369, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 31 (1995)
(criticizing “the routine filing of lawsuits * * * without
regard to any underlying culpability of the issuer”).
Inter alia, the PSLRA requires a private securitiesfraud complaint to “state with particularity facts giving
rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with
the required state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(b)(2).
In 2002, Congress established an express federal
statute of limitations to govern securities-fraud claims.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Pub. L. No. 107-204, § 804, 116
Stat. 801 (28 U.S.C. 1658(b)). Section 1658(b) applies to
any “private right of action that involves a claim of
fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws.” Like the limitations periods borrowed by the
Court in Lampf, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established
both a period of repose, 28 U.S.C. 1658(b)(2), and a limitations period running “after the discovery of the facts
constituting the violation,” 28 U.S.C. 1658(b)(1). Congress lengthened the time available to bring suit, how-

4

ever, by extending the limitations period to two years
and the period of repose to five.
The Senate Judiciary Committee explained that
Lampf ’s one-year period encouraged “victims to race
into court.” S. Rep. No. 146, 107th Cong., 2d Sess. 9
(2002). The Committee contemplated that, in contrast
to the one-year period, the two-year period would allow
a plaintiff “to file a complaint under a heightened pleading standard, survive[] a motion to dismiss, begin[] discovery, and learn[] that an additional wrongdoer or theory should be added to the case.” Ibid.
2. Merck developed Vioxx as one of a new class of
painkillers with less harmful gastrointestinal (GI) sideeffects. Pet. App. 5a. The market viewed Vioxx as having blockbuster potential. Ibid. To demonstrate Vioxx’s
superior GI safety, Merck undertook a large-scale
study—the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research
(VIGOR) study—comparing Vioxx to naproxen, the ingredient in other pain relievers. Id. at 6a. The results
of the study did show greater GI safety, but also showed
that Vioxx users suffered significantly more heart attacks than naproxen users. Ibid. To explain that discrepancy, Merck’s public statements advanced the “naproxen hypothesis”—i.e., that the lower incidence of
cardiac events for patients taking naproxen was attributable to a beneficial effect of naproxen rather than to
any harmful effect of Vioxx. Id. at 7a. In a press release
about the study, Merck noted, however, that such an
effect “had not been observed previously in any clinical
studies for naproxen.” J.A. 291.
In September 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Warning Letter informing Merck
that its marketing of Vioxx was “false, lacking in fair
balance, or otherwise misleading in violation of the Fed-

5

eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.” J.A. 339. The
FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis was “a
possible explanation” for the VIGOR study’s data concerning cardiac events, but faulted Merck for failing to
balance presentation of that hypothesis with the alternative “reasonable explanation, that Vioxx may have prothrombotic properties.” J.A. 340. The FDA directed
Merck to issue a corrective letter to healthcare providers. J.A. 353.
The Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston conducted a study funded by Merck (the Harvard Study) to
test Vioxx’s cardiac effect against Celebrex, another
painkiller, and a placebo. On October 30, 2003, a Wall
Street Journal (WSJ) article cited the Harvard Study
as having “found an increased risk of heart attack in
patients taking Vioxx compared with patients taking
Celebrex and placebo.” Pet. App. 18a. According to the
article, the increased relative risk of heart attack, between 30 and 90 days, was 37%. Ibid.
3. On November 6, 2003, a week after the WSJ article, the first securities class-action complaint regarding Vioxx’s safety was filed. C.A. App. 1218 (Pringle
Compl.). The complaint characterized the October 30
WSJ article, and another from October 22 reporting that
Vioxx sales were “suffering from clinical trial data suggesting it might slightly raise the risk of heart attacks,”
as having disclosed the truth about Vioxx’s increased
cardiac risk. Id. at 1245-1248. Apart from recounting
these news articles, the complaint made only generalized
allegations of scienter. Id. at 1248.
On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew Vioxx from
the market, based on a new study indicating “an increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18 months of continuous therapy.” Pet. App.

6

19a (internal quotation marks omitted). On November
1, 2004, the WSJ reported that “internal Merck e-mails
and marketing materials as well as interviews with outside scientists show that the company fought forcefully
for years to keep safety concerns from destroying the
drug’s commercial prospects.” Ibid.
Ten new securities class-action complaints were filed
during the next three months. See C.A. App. 121-174
(docket sheets). The Judicial Panel on Multi-District
Litigation directed that all the lawsuits be centralized in
the District of New Jersey. J.A. 17.
On June 15, 2005, after the cases were consolidated,
respondents filed a 453-paragraph Corrected Consolidated And Fourth Amended Class Action Complaint.
J.A. 20-264. The Fourth Amended Complaint cites the
November 1, 2004, WSJ article as having “revealed the
truth concerning [petitioners’] wrongful conduct and
their actual knowledge of the truth regarding Vioxx.”
J.A. 197.
4. Petitioners moved to dismiss the Fourth
Amended Complaint, arguing that the suit was timebarred because information suggesting Merck’s possible
fraud had been released to the public more than two
years before the November 6, 2003, filing of the first
complaint. The district court granted the motion. Pet.
App. 62a-99a. The court held that respondents were on
“inquiry notice” of Merck’s possible fraud by October 9,
2001. Id. at 85a. The court characterized the September 2001 FDA Warning Letter as having, “in no uncertain terms, * * * accuse[d] Merck of misrepresentation by endorsing the naproxen hypothesis as fact.”
Ibid. The court also noted “numerous articles” (the last
of which appeared on October 9, 2001) reporting “the
competing prothrombotic hypothesis * * * that

7

VIOXX in fact increased the risk of heart attack.” Id. at
87a; see id. at 85a, 89a.
Because respondents were on inquiry notice 25
months before the first Vioxx lawsuit was filed, and had
not made diligent investigation thereafter, the district
court held their suit untimely. Pet. App. 97a-98a. The
court concluded that “a reasonable investor would have
discovered the basis for his fraud claims against Merck
* * * within the two years following the storm warnings which existed before November 6, 2001.” Id. at 98a.
5. The court of appeals reversed. Pet. App. 1a-61a.
The court held that the timeliness of the complaint depended on when respondents knew or should have
known of the basis of their claims, which, in turn, depended on when they had “inquiry notice.” Id. at 22a.
The court defined “inquiry notice” as “sufficient information of possible wrongdoing * * * to excite storm
warnings of culpable activity.” Id. at 28a (quoting
Benak v. Alliance Capital Mgmt., L.P., 435 F.3d 396,
400 (3d Cir. 2006)).
The court of appeals held that respondents were not
on “inquiry notice” of Merck’s possible fraud before November 6, 2001, and that their initial complaint was
therefore timely. The court stressed that the FDA
Warning Letter “did not charge that the naproxen hypothesis was wrong or that Merck did not believe in [its]
validity,” but only directed Merck to be more clear about
the competing hypothesis, which was already publicly
known. Pet. App. 43a. The court also rejected the district court’s conclusion that “storm warnings” had arisen
from the October 9 New York Times article. Id. at 45a46a. The court explained that, although a Merck official
quoted in that article had acknowledged the competing
explanations for the VIGOR study results, he had reaf-

8

firmed Merck’s view that the naproxen hypothesis is
“the likeliest interpretation.” Id. at 45a. The court of
appeals concluded that “there [was] no reason to suspect
that Merck did not believe the naproxen hypothesis until
the Harvard Study in 2003 revealed an increased risk of
heart attack” for Vioxx compared to Celebrex and a placebo. Id. at 47a.
Judge Roth dissented. Pet. App. 49a-61a. She would
have held that the FDA Warning Letter put respondents on inquiry notice of a possibly fraudulent misrepresentation. Id. at 55a. Because respondents had conducted no investigation after the FDA Warning Letter,
Judge Roth would have held that the limitations period
expired two years thereafter, before the first class-action complaint was filed. Id. at 61a.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

A. Section 1658(b)(1)’s two-year limitations period
does not begin to run until the plaintiff has actually discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence ought
to have discovered, facts demonstrating that all the elements of a securities-fraud violation can be established.
In particular, because scienter is an essential element
of a Section 10(b) violation, the term “facts constituting
the violation” is best construed to include facts demonstrating that the defendant possessed the requisite mental state. And while the term “discovery” in Section
1658(b)(1) encompasses constructive as well as actual
discovery, constructive discovery is properly deemed to
occur at the time a reasonably diligent investor would
have unearthed the relevant facts—not when such an
investor would begin investigating. That reading is confirmed by 15 U.S.C. 77m, which establishes an express
constructive-discovery rule that provides the best evi-

9

dence of Congress’s intent as to the proper application
of constructive-discovery principles in the securities
context.
Petitioners are therefore wrong in arguing that Section 1658(b)(1)’s limitations period runs from the time an
investor is placed on “inquiry notice.” Petitioners’ alternative argument—that the limitations period should run
from the time of “inquiry notice” at least when the plaintiff fails to exercise reasonable diligence in investigating
suspicious circumstances—is likewise incorrect. In such
cases too, the limitations period should run from the
time a diligent investor would have discovered the facts
constituting the violation. When Congress specifies the
time at which a limitations period will commence, courts
have no authority to direct that the period run from an
earlier date, even to “punish” dilatory plaintiffs. If Congress had wanted to modify the limitations period in this
way, Congress could have done so. Here, it did not.
B. A plaintiff is placed on “inquiry notice” of a possible Section 10(b) violation only if the available information suggests that a defendant’s possible misrepresentation was made with scienter. The purpose of the “inquiry notice” concept is to identify the point in time
when a reasonably diligent investor would have commenced an investigation. Because scienter is an essential element of a Section 10(b) violation, an investor who
suspects that a misrepresentation was made, but has no
reason to believe that it was anything other than an innocent mistake, cannot fairly be charged with lack of
reasonable diligence if he declines to inquire further.
C. The court of appeals correctly held that respondents’ suit was timely filed. Although numerous documents (including the FDA Warning Letter on which petitioners principally rely) made clear that the naproxen

10

hypothesis was unproven and open to debate, those documents did not place respondents on “inquiry notice”
because they gave respondents no reason to suspect that
Merck’s statement of its belief in the naproxen hypothesis was made with scienter. In any event, even if the
FDA letter would have led a reasonably diligent investor
to suspect that Merck had made knowing misrepresentations with regard to the naproxen hypothesis, petitioners identify no means by which respondents could have
confirmed those suspicions before November 6, 2001.
ARGUMENT
THIS ACTION IS TIMELY BECAUSE RESPONDENTS NEITHER KNEW, NOR REASONABLY COULD HAVE KNOWN,
THE FACTS CONSTITUTING PETITIONERS’ ALLEGED
SECTION 10(b) VIOLATION MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEFORE FILING SUIT

Under 28 U.S.C. 1658(b), a federal securities-fraud
action must be commenced “not later than the earlier
of ” the following two dates: “2 years after the discovery
of the facts constituting the violation,” 28 U.S.C.
1658(b)(1), or “5 years after such violation,” 28 U.S.C.
1658(b)(2). Petitioners contend that the two-year period
specified in Section 1658(b)(1) runs from the date when
“a plaintiff possesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive of wrongdoing that he should conduct
a further inquiry to confirm the existence of his claim.”
Pet. Br. 20 (defining inquiry notice); id. at 40 (“inquiry
notice [sh]ould always trigger the running of the limitations period”). Petitioners’ theory cannot be reconciled
with the text of Section 1658(b)(1). Acceptance of that
approach would also subvert the balance struck by Congress between (a) encouraging potential securities-fraud
plaintiffs to conduct prompt and diligent investigations,

11

(b) ensuring that such plaintiffs have adequate time to
conduct appropriate inquiries and to pursue litigation if
their investigations reveal a sound basis to infer wrongdoing, and (c) discouraging “strike suits” premised on
mere suspicion of fraud.
A.	 Section 1658(b)(1)’s Two-Year Period Begins To Run
Only After The Plaintiff Discovers Or Should Have Discovered Facts Demonstrating That All Elements Of A
Securities-Fraud Violation Can Be Established

Congress adopted Section 1658(b) in response to this
Court’s decision in Lampf. In Lampf, the Court held
that securities-fraud claims under Section 10(b) and
SEC Rule 10b-5 were governed by a uniform federal
limitations period and must be brought within the earlier of one year “after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation” or three years after the violation,
the latter of which constituted an absolute period of repose. 501 U.S. at 364. The Court borrowed that language from the limitations periods that Congress had
provided in 15 U.S.C. 77m, 78i(e), and 78r(c), for express
causes of action under the 1933 and 1934 Acts. See
Lampf, 501 U.S. at 359-360 & nn.6-7, 364 n.9.
In 2002, Congress extended the limitations period
from one to two years and extended the period of repose
from three to five years, while retaining Lampf ’s trigger
for the limitations period to begin running—“discovery
of the facts constituting the violation.” 28 U.S.C.
1658(b)(1). Proper application of Section 1658(b)(1) requires the Court (1) to construe the phrase “facts constituting the violation” and (2) to identify the point at
which “discovery” of those facts occurs.

12

1.	 The term “facts constituting the violation” in Section
1658(b)(1) means facts demonstrating that the defendant has violated the securities laws

To establish a violation of Section 10(b), a plaintiff
must prove that the defendant made a material misrepresentation or omission in connection with the purchase
or sale of a security, and that “the defendant acted with
scienter, ‘a mental state embracing intent to deceive,
manipulate, or defraud.’ ” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues
& Rights, Ltd ., 551 U.S. 308, 319 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see Aaron v. SEC, 446
U.S. 680, 691 (1980) (explaining that “scienter is an element of a violation of § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5”).1 Although scienter must often be established circumstantially, it is nonetheless a “fact” that must be pleaded and
proved. Cf. Edgington v. Fitzmaurice, 29 Ch. D. 459,
483 (Eng. 1885) (“[T]he state of a man’s mind is as much
a fact as the state of his digestion.”). The phrase “facts
constituting the violation” in Section 1658(b)(1) should
be construed in light of those substantive legal requirements. Thus, the two-year limitations period established by Section 1658(b)(1) begins to run upon the
plaintiff ’s discovery of facts demonstrating that the defendant has made the sort of material misrepresentation
or omission that Section 10(b) covers, with the requisite
mental state.
1

To recover under the private right of action implied under Section
10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a private plaintiff must establish elements beyond
those required for a “violation” of Section 10(b), such as reliance, loss,
and loss causation. See Dura, 544 U.S. at 341-342. We agree with petitioners (Br. 25, 29) that facts bearing on those additional requirements
are not naturally viewed as among the “facts constituting the violation”
within the meaning of Section 1658(b)(1).

13

Construing the statute in that fashion is consistent
with the PSLRA. That statute requires securities-fraud
plaintiffs who sue as class representatives to “specify
each statement [of the defendant] alleged to have been
misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.” 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(b)(1). In addition,
in any private suit “in which the plaintiff may recover
money damages only on proof that the defendant acted
with a particular state of mind, the complaint shall
* * * state with particularity facts giving rise to a
strong inference that the defendant acted with the requisite state of mind.” 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(b)(2). A primary
purpose of the PSLRA’s heightened pleading requirement with respect to scienter is to discourage plaintiffs
from charging as securities fraud every statement that
has turned out to be false. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 369, at
31. Consistent with that enactment, Section 1658(b)(1)’s
limitations period should begin to run when the plaintiff
discovered or ought to have discovered facts that, if set
out in a complaint, would allege scienter, as well as all
other elements of a statutory violation, with sufficient
specificity to survive a motion to dismiss.2
Petitioners contend (Br. 41) that “the phrase ‘facts
constituting the violation’ [in Section 1658(b)(1)] is properly understood to reach only the core nucleus of facts
2

Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549 (2000), did not, as petitioners contend
(Br. 31), reject considering pleading standards when construing statutes of limitations. In deciding when the limitations period should start
to run under RICO, the Court reasoned that because many civil RICO
claims do not involve fraud, there was an “insufficient connection between civil RICO and fraud” to warrant considering Fed. R. Civ. P.
9(b)’s heightened pleading standards. Rotella, 528 U.S. at 557. By contrast, every Rule 10b-5 complaint must surmount heightened pleading
standards.

14

concerning the defendant’s conduct, separate and apart
from the fact of the defendant’s state of mind.” But
where, as under Section 10(b), an innocent misstatement
does not violate the applicable law, facts suggesting that
such a misstatement has occurred are not naturally
characterized as “facts constituting [a] violation.” That
inference is reinforced by Section 1658(b)(1)’s application only to private suits “that involve[] a claim of fraud,
deceit, manipulation, or contrivance.” 28 U.S.C. 1658(b).
Because the class of suits covered by Section 1658(b)(1)
is defined in part by reference to the defendant’s dishonest intent, it is particularly clear that the “facts constituting the violation” include facts demonstrating the
requisite scienter.
And indeed, petitioners themselves do not construe
the phrase “facts constituting the violation” as limited to
facts concerning what the defendant actually did. Petitioners decline to contend that Section 1658(b)(1)’s twoyear limitations period commenced to run as soon as
respondents discovered that Merck had endorsed the
naproxen hypothesis. Rather, petitioners argue that the
triggering “discovery” occurred upon the publication of
materials (the FDA Warning Letter and various newspaper articles) suggesting that the naproxen hypothesis
was false. But if the phrase “facts constituting the violation” encompasses facts that demonstrate the falsity of
previously known statements, so too must that phrase
encompass facts that demonstrate the mental state with
which such statements were made. Both sets of facts go
to the illegality, rather than mere existence, of the defendant’s statements, and neither is any more indispensable
than the other in establishing that illegality. Because
falsity and scienter are both elements of a Section 10(b)

15

violation, there is no basis for distinguishing between
the facts demonstrating the two.
2.	 Section 1658(b)(1)’s two-year limitations period can
be triggered by either actual or constructive discovery of the “facts constituting the violation,” but is
not triggered by mere suspicion of illegality

a. Section 1658(b)(1)’s reference to “the discovery of
the facts constituting the violation” most obviously covers the actual discovery by the plaintiff of the facts constituting the defendant’s violation of the securities laws.
In addition, however, the term “discovery” in this provision is properly read to encompass constructive discovery. When Congress enacted Section 1658(b)(1), it was
well-established that the limitations period adopted in
Lampf could commence to run either upon actual discovery of the relevant facts or at the time of constructive
discovery—i.e., the time when the plaintiff should have
discovered the violation in the exercise of reasonable
diligence.
In Lampf, the Court referenced Section 13 of the
Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77m, which includes an
express constructive-discovery rule, as one source of the
limitations period the Court adopted. See Lampf, 501
U.S. at 360 n.7. Under Section 13, the limitations period
begins to run “after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should
have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.”
15 U.S.C. 77m (emphasis added). Between this Court’s
decision in Lampf and the enactment of Section
1658(b)(1), the courts of appeals uniformly applied a rule
of constructive discovery, often by express reference to

16

Section 13.3 This Court likewise construed similarly
worded limitations provisions to encompass constructive
discovery. E.g., Kirby v. Lake Shore & Mich. S. R.R.,
120 U.S. 130, 134-135, 138 (1887) (construing statute
providing that action for fraud is “not to be deemed to
have accrued until the discovery by the aggrieved party
of the facts constituting the fraud” to mean that the statute did not run “until after such fraud was or should,
with due diligence, have been discovered”) (quoting N.Y.
Code of Procedure § 91(6), at 70 (Voorhies’ 5th ed.
1857)). Congress can therefore be presumed to have
intended that the same construction be given to Section
1658(b)(1). See, e.g., Commissioner v. Keystone Consol.
Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 152, 159 (1993).
b. When the two-year limitations period is triggered
by constructive rather than actual discovery of the securities violation, the court should typically undertake a
two-step analysis to calculate when the limitations period began to run. First, the court identifies the point at
which the plaintiff received information sufficiently suggestive of possible wrongdoing that a reasonable investor would have undertaken further investigation to de3

& Co., 129 F.3d 222, 224 (1st Cir. 1997); Dodds v. CIGNA Sec., Inc., 12
F.3d 346, 349 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing Section 13), cert. denied, 511 U.S.

Cir. 2001); Brumbaugh v. Princeton Partners, 985 F.2d 157, 162 (4th
Cir. 1993); Topalian v. Ehrman, 954 F.2d 1125, 1134-1135 (5th Cir.),
cert. denied, 506 U.S. 825 (1992); New Eng. Health Care Employees
Pension Fund v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F.3d 495, 500 (6th Cir. 2003)
(citing Section 13), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1183 (2004); Law v. Medco
Research, Inc., 113 F.3d 781, 785-786 (7th Cir. 1997) (same); Ritchey v.
Horner, 244 F.3d 635, 638-639 (8th Cir. 2001) (same); Sterlin v. Biomune Sys., 154 F.3d 1191, 1199-1202 (10th Cir. 1998) (same); Theoharous v. Fong, 256 F.3d 1219, 1228 (11th Cir. 2001).

17

termine whether the defendant had violated the securities laws. That point is commonly referred to as “inquiry notice.”4
Second, the court must ascertain at what time “the
investor, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should
have discovered the facts constituting the alleged
fraud.” Betz v. Trainer Wortham & Co, 519 F.3d 863,
876 (9th Cir. 2008), petition for cert. pending, No.
07-1489 (filed May 27, 2008). It is “[t]he answer to that
second question” which identifies the date on which “the
statute of limitations began to run.” Ibid.; accord, e.g.,
New Eng. Health Care Employees Pension Fund v.
Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F.3d 495, 501 (6th Cir. 2003),
cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1183 (2004); Sudo Props., Inc. v.
Terrebonne Parish Consol. Gov’t, 503 F.3d 371, 377-378
(5th Cir. 2007); Young v. Lepone, 305 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st
Cir. 2002); Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 97 (2d Cir.
2000); Sterlin v. Biomune Sys., 154 F.3d 1191, 1201
(10th Cir. 1998); Howard v. Haddad, 962 F.2d 328, 330
(4th Cir. 1992) (Powell, J.).
Petitioners argue (Br. 40) that “the date on which the
plaintiff was on inquiry notice [should] always trigger
the running of the limitations period.” That approach
cannot be squared with the language of Section
1658(b)(1). Section 1658(b)(1)’s two-year limitations
4

The terminology used by the courts has not been uniform, and
some use “inquiry notice” to refer to what is described here and by petitioners as “constructive discovery.” See, e.g., Berry v. Valence Tech.,
Inc., 175 F.3d 699, 704 (9th Cir.) (describing as “inquiry notice” the rule
that, after investigation is triggered, the “limitations period begins to
run once the investor, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should
have discovered the facts underlying the alleged fraud”) (quoting Sterlin, 154 F.3d at 1201), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1019 (1999); S. Rep. No.
146, at 29 (views of dissenting Senators).

18

period begins to run not when a reasonable investor
would become suspicious or commence further investigation, but only “after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation.” Even in a case involving constructive
discovery, in which the court must determine when a
reasonably diligent investor would have discovered the
relevant facts, the point at which a diligent investigation
would have borne fruit will inevitably be later than the
point at which the investigation should have commenced.
There is consequently no textual basis for petitioners’
view that the two-year limitations period begins to run
when the plaintiff is placed on “inquiry notice.” No
more than actual discovery occurs when an investigation
commences does constructive discovery occur when an
investigation should have done so.
The error in petitioners’ approach is confirmed by
15 U.S.C. 77m, one of the limitations periods on which
the Court in Lampf relied (see 501 U.S. at 360 & n.7),
which establishes an express constructive-discovery
rule. Section 77m states that “[n]o action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under section 77k
or 77l(a)(2) of this title unless brought within one year
after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by
the exercise of reasonable diligence.” 15 U.S.C. 77m
(emphasis added).5 Section 77m provides the best evidence of Congress’s understanding of how constructivediscovery principles apply in the securities context. In
a case in which the plaintiff fails to exercise “reasonable
5

Unlike Section 10(b), the provisions of law to which Section 77m
applies (15 U.S.C. 77k and 77l(a)(2)) do not make scienter an element
of a statutory violation, but rather make the defendant’s lack of knowledge of falsity an affirmative defense. See 15 U.S.C. 77k(b)(3); 15
U.S.C. 77l(a)(2).

19

diligence,” Section 77m unambiguously provides that the
limitations period begins to run at the time a diligent
plaintiff would actually have discovered the defendant’s
false statement, not at the time (i.e., inquiry notice)
when the diligent plaintiff would have commenced an
investigation. There is no warrant for construing Section 1658(b)(1), which simply refers to “discovery of the
facts constituting the violation” and does not expressly
provide that constructive discovery will suffice, to establish an earlier trigger for the limitations period.
c. In a case in which even a diligent investigation
would take more than two years to complete, the approach that petitioners advocate—under which Section
1658(b)(1)’s limitations period would begin to run when
the plaintiff is placed on “inquiry notice” and therefore
should commence his investigation—would result in the
limitations period expiring before a diligent plaintiff
could acquire facts sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. That result is incompatible with this Court’s decision in Lampf, which held that the limitations period
applicable to private securities actions is not subject to
equitable tolling because the period “by its terms, begins after discovery of the facts constituting the violation, making tolling unnecessary.” 501 U.S. at 363. That
analysis presumes that the two-year limitations period
(unlike the five-year “period of repose” that “serve[s] as
a cutoff ” for all claims, see ibid.) cannot bar claims before a reasonably diligent plaintiff could learn the facts
necessary to assert them.
In addition to foreclosing the claims of some plaintiffs despite the plaintiffs’ exercise of reasonable diligence, petitioners’ reading of Section 1658(b)(1) would
frustrate the purpose, common to the PSLRA and Section 1658(b), of discouraging so-called “strike suits.”

20

The Senate Report to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act recited
that, under Lampf, plaintiffs were on a “one year ‘stop
watch’ ” that ran “from the moment they know that they
have been cheated.” S. Rep. No. 146, at 9. In extending
the limitations period to two years, the Report explained
that “even after the fraud is discovered,” plaintiffs need
additional time to “find out more about exactly who participated in the fraudulent activity and how,” in order to
“learn[] that an additional wrongdoer” should be “added
to the case” that is otherwise ready to be filed. Ibid.
The report criticized the one-year period as too short,
driving plaintiffs “to race into court, so as not to be
barred by time,” and to “throw[] in every possible defendant and every claim” “almost immediately upon a
change in the stock price.” Ibid. Petitioners’ reading of
Section 1658(b)(1), under which the two-year limitations
period may begin to run well before a reasonably diligent plaintiff learns sufficient facts to support a wellfounded complaint, would create renewed incentives to
the sort of hasty filings that Congress sought to discourage.6
3.	 Even if the plaintiff fails to undertake a reasonably
diligent investigation after inquiry notice, the twoyear limitations period runs from when such an investigation would have revealed the “facts constituting the violation,” not from when the investigation
should have commenced

In the alternative, petitioners urge (Br. 43-48) this
Court to adopt a hybrid approach, drawn from decisions
6

Petitioners cite the “additional views of eight Senators.” See, e.g.,
Pet. Br. 20, 46. Because seven of those eight Senators voted against extending the statutory period, S. Rep. No. 146, at 22, their views are an
unreliable guide for construing Section 1658(b)(1).

21

of the Second and Third Circuits, see, e.g., LC Capital
Partners, LP v. Frontier Ins. Group, Inc., 318 F.3d 148,
154 (2d Cir. 2003); Mathews v. Kidder, Peabody & Co.,
260 F.3d 239, 255 (3d Cir. 2001), under which the time
when Section 1658(b)(1)’s two-year limitations period
begins to run turns on whether the plaintiff conducted
a reasonably diligent investigation. Under petitioners’
alternative theory, when a plaintiff diligently investigates his possible claim after being placed on inquiry
notice, the two-year period runs from the time the plaintiff actually discovers the “facts constituting the violation.” Petitioners contend (Br. 47), however, that “when
a plaintiff fails to conduct a reasonably diligent investigation, he can be deemed, as an equitable matter, to
have ‘discovered’ the relevant facts as of the date of inquiry notice,” and the two-year period should therefore
run from that date. That theory is inconsistent with the
text and purposes of Section 1658(b)(1) and with its role
in the larger statutory scheme.
a. As explained above (see pp. 16-20, supra), constructive “discovery of the facts constituting the violation” is deemed to occur at the time a reasonably diligent investigation would have given the plaintiff actual
knowledge of those facts. If that understanding of Section 1658(b)(1) is sound—i.e., if petitioners are wrong in
arguing that the plaintiff “discover[s] * * * the facts
constituting the violation” when he is placed on inquiry
notice—a court has no authority to adopt, even for dilatory plaintiffs, an earlier triggering date for the limitations period than the date Congress specified. Petitioners’ fallback theory is in substance an attempt to engraft
laches principles onto Section 1658(b)(1); but “[l]aches
within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense
at law.” United States v. Mack, 295 U.S. 480, 489 (1935).

22

That is particularly so in the present context, where the
five-year period of repose established by Section
1658(b)(2) provides an outer limit on the dilatory plaintiff ’s ability to pursue securities-law claims. See pp. 2426, infra. Had Congress additionally wished to modify
the triggering date for the limitations period in cases in
which an investor has been dilatory, Congress could
have done so. Here it did not choose to incorporate in
this way principles of laches into the statute of limitations it adopted.
Petitioners’ alternative theory is also inconsistent
with the express constructive-discovery rule established
by 15 U.S.C. 77m, which provides that the limitations
period should start to run in the relevant cases “after
the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or
after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.” Ibid. Section 77m unambiguously contemplates that, when the plaintiff fails to
exercise “reasonable diligence,” the limitations period
will begin to run when “discovery should have been
made,” not when the plaintiff should have commenced
his investigation. As the best evidence of Congress’s
intent regarding the operation of constructive-discovery
principles in the securities context, Section 77m refutes
a reading of Section 1658(b)(1) that would establish an
earlier triggering date in cases in which the plaintiff
fails to conduct a diligent investigation. See pp. 18-19,
supra.
b. Petitioners identify (Br. 48-51) three principal
policy objections to the government’s construction of
Section 1658(b)(1), under which the two-year limitations
period begins to run at the time that a reasonably diligent investigation would have uncovered the “facts constituting the violation,” even if the plaintiff himself fails

23

to conduct such an investigation. Those objections provide no basis for disregarding the statutory text, and
they are unsound even on their own terms.
i. Petitioners contend (Br. 48) that the government’s approach “would effectively excuse a plaintiff ’s
failure to conduct a further investigation after being
placed on inquiry notice of a Section 10(b) violation” and
would place such a plaintiff “in the same position as a
plaintiff who does conduct a reasonably diligent investigation.” But a plaintiff who conducts a diligent investigation, and who thereby acquires facts sufficient to file
a well-grounded complaint, is obviously in a better position than one who fails to obtain such facts, and therefore cannot proceed with his suit (even though he has
the same time to do so). Providing the term “discovery”
in Section 1658(b)(1) is read to encompass constructive
as well as actual discovery, so that a plaintiff cannot extend the period for commencing suit by failing to investigate suspicious circumstances, an investor who is placed
on inquiry notice will have an adequate incentive to conduct an investigation.
ii. Petitioners argue (Br. 50) that the government’s
approach “would lead to potentially grave difficulties in
application, because it would force courts to engage in
entirely hypothetical inquiries about what a reasonably
diligent investigation would have entailed and how long
it would have taken for such an investigation to bear
fruit.” That objection is misguided. To be sure, determining how long a hypothetical investigation would have
taken to unearth the “facts constituting the violation”
will often involve some approximation. But this lack of
complete certainty is an inherent consequence of construing Section 1658(b)(1) to encompass constructive
discovery. Although Section 1658(b)(1) might be easier

24

to apply if its two-year limitations period were triggered
only by a plaintiff ’s actual discovery of the relevant
facts, petitioners insist (correctly, in our view) that the
two-year period may begin to run before actual discovery occurs if “the plaintiff should have known of the relevant facts at an earlier date than he actually did.” Br.
18. Petitioners cannot reasonably urge the Court to
adopt that interpretation of Section 1658(b)(1) and then
complain that the time of constructive discovery is too
difficult to ascertain.
iii. Petitioners also contend (Br. 51) that the government’s approach “would seemingly render the principle
of inquiry notice irrelevant.” That is incorrect. To identify the point in time when a reasonably diligent plaintiff
would have discovered particular facts, a court must
determine both when the plaintiff would have begun his
investigation and how long a reasonable investigation
would have taken to bear fruit. An approach that disregarded the former question and focused only on how the
investigation was conducted once commenced would allow plaintiffs to postpone the triggering of the two-year
period simply by declining to begin an investigation.
Although the phrase “inquiry notice” does not appear in
the statute, it is a convenient shorthand term for the
point in time at which the available facts cast sufficient
doubt on the propriety of the defendant’s conduct that
a diligent plaintiff would have begun to investigate. So
understood, the concept of “inquiry notice” is integral to
Section 1658(b)(1)’s proper application.
c. Petitioners’ approach is especially inappropriate
where, as here, Congress has adopted a bifurcated limitations period, in which an express “discovery” provision
is paired with an absolute period of repose. Cf. Lampf,
501 U.S. at 362 n.8 (concluding that “the 1-and-3-year

25

scheme” contained in then-existing law “represents an
indivisible determination by Congress as to the appropriate cutoff point for claims under the statute”). Petitioners rely (e.g., Br. 21-22, 25, 44-45) on such decisions
as Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549 (2000); Klehr v. A.O.
Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179 (1997); and United States v.
Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111 (1979). In each of those cases, the
relevant limitations period began to run when the plaintiff ’s claim “accrued.”7 And in each case, the plaintiff
contended that his claim had not “accrued” until he acquired actual or constructive knowledge of some relevant fact. See Rotella, 528 U.S. at 552-553; Klehr, 521
U.S. at 192; Kubrick, 444 U.S. at 118. In rejecting those
arguments, the Court expressed concern that adopting
the plaintiffs’ approach to the “accru[al]” of claims
would unduly expand the period of time within which
suit could be filed. See Rotella, 528 U.S. at 555, 558-559;
Klehr, 521 U.S. at 192; Kubrick, 444 U.S. at 117-118,
123. The Court in Rotella noted that “fraud * * * is
generally associated with a different accrual rule.” 528
U.S. at 557.
Section 1658(b)(1) does not use the term “accrued,”
but rather specifies the information—i.e., the “facts constituting the violation”—that the plaintiff must (actually
or constructively) “discover[]” before the two-year limitations period will begin to run. And unlike the discovery principles that the plaintiffs in the cases discussed
7

The statute of limitations at issue in Rotella and Klehr provided:
“Any action * * * shall be forever barred unless commenced within
four years after the cause of action accrued.” 15 U.S.C. 15b (Clayton
Act, applied to civil RICO actions); see Rotella, 528 U.S. at 553; Klehr,
521 U.S. at 183. The statute of limitations at issue in Kubrick barred
any claim not brought “within two years after such claim accrues.” 28
U.S.C. 2401(b) (Federal Tort Claims Act).

26

above sought to invoke, Section 1658(b)(1) does not expand the period in which suit may be filed. Section
1658(b)(2) establishes a five-year period of repose, and
Section 1658(b) requires that suits alleging violations of
Section 10(b) must be filed “not later than the earlier
of ” the dates specified in Subsections (1) and (2).
28 U.S.C. 1658(b). Section 1658(b)(1) therefore can operate only to shorten the five-year period (measured
from the date of “the violation”) set by Section
1658(b)(2), which remains the outer limit for bringing
suit. Construing Section 1658(b)(1) in accordance with
its terms therefore creates no risk that the time for filing suit will extend indefinitely if the plaintiff is unable
(either because of his own dilatory conduct or through
circumstances beyond his control) to acquire the information needed to support his claim.
B.	 Inquiry Notice Of A Possible Section 10(b) Violation
Arises Only If Circumstances Suggest A Misrepresentation Or Omission Made With Scienter

Contrary to petitioners’ contention (Br. 19-28), an
investor is not placed on “inquiry notice” of a potential
Section 10(b) claim unless he has reason to suspect that
a defendant’s possible misrepresentation was made with
scienter. Because scienter is an essential element of a
Section 10(b) violation, an investor who suspects only an
innocent or negligent misrepresentation will have no
reason to undertake a potentially time-consuming and
costly investigation. Petitioners’ rule, especially when
combined with their proposal that the two-year period
should run from the time of inquiry notice, would create
an untoward incentive for plaintiffs to file hastilydrafted complaints, based only on evidence of a misrepresentation, in order to avoid the limitations bar. Plain-

27

tiffs with meritorious claims, however, would be barred
before they could have discovered the violation—and
indeed before they would have had reason to suspect it.
1.	 Inquiry notice identifies when a reasonable plaintiff
would begin investigating a possible violation

The court of appeals correctly held that, “to trigger
‘storm warnings of culpable activity,’ in the context of a
claim alleging falsely-held opinions or beliefs, investors
must have sufficient information to suspect that the defendants engaged in culpable activity, i.e., that they did
not hold those opinions or beliefs in earnest.” Pet. App.
33a (citation omitted). Two other courts of appeals have
likewise held that suspicion of scienter is necessary to
trigger inquiry notice. See Betz, 519 F.3d at 876, 878;
Sudo Props., 503 F.3d at 375, 378 (inquiry notice was not
triggered by plaintiff ’s knowledge that defendant’s predictions were “grossly incorrect,” until plaintiff “learned
for the first time that [defendant] had intentionally misled him”). Other circuits, without expressly addressing
the issue, have similarly characterized “inquiry notice”
in terms of putting the plaintiff on notice of potential
“fraud,” which connotes scienter. See Dodds v. CIGNA
Sec., Inc., 12 F.3d 346, 350 (2d Cir. 1993) (information
that “would suggest * * * the probability that [the
investor] has been defrauded”), cert. denied, 511 U.S.
1019 (1994); Maggio v. Gerard Freezer & Ice Co., 824
F.2d 123, 128 (1st Cir. 1987) (facts that “would have
alerted a reasonable investor to the possibility of fraudulent conduct.”); Fujisawa Pharm. Co. v. Kapoor, 115
F.3d 1332, 1335 (7th Cir. 1997) (“[t]he facts constituting
[inquiry] notice must be sufficiently probative of fraud”).
Those decisions are consistent with the ultimate statutory inquiry: to identify the point at which a reason-

28

ably diligent investor should have discovered “the facts
constituting the violation” of Section 10(b). 28 U.S.C.
1658(b)(1) (emphasis added). As one step in the twostep analysis used to determine when such an investor
would have unearthed those facts, the “inquiry notice”
concept serves to determine when the investigation
should have begun. See pp. 16-18, supra. When an investor has reason to suspect that he was given inaccurate securities-related information, but has no reasonable basis to suppose that the misstatement was anything other than an error, he has no cause to think that
a securities violation has occurred. Under those circumstances, a reasonable investor would not commence an
investigation: he would not devote time or resources to
exploring a potential legal action for which an essential
element appears to be lacking.
2.	 Suspicion of scienter is necessary for inquiry notice,
though it may arise from suspicion of falsity

Petitioners contend (Pet. Br. 21-22, 41-42) that inquiry notice can exist without suspicion of scienter because scienter is not one of the “core” facts constituting
a securities-fraud violation. That is incorrect. As discussed above, see p. 12, supra, this Court has repeatedly
held that scienter is an element of a Section 10(b) violation. See, e.g., Aaron, 446 U.S. at 691. Congress confirmed the centrality of scienter to a Section 10(b) violation in the PSLRA’s requirement that a securities-fraud
complaint allege facts giving rise to a “strong inference”
of scienter. See 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(b)(1) and (2). And because Section 1658(b)(1) applies only to “claim[s] of
fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance,” 28 U.S.C.
1658(b), the limitations provision itself confirms the cen-

29

trality of scienter to the violations it covers. See p. 12,
supra.
Petitioner’s reliance (Br. 21-22) on TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 30 (2001), is misplaced. In TRW, the
Court held that “Congress implicitly excluded [from the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681p,] a general
discovery rule by explicitly including a more limited
one.” TRW, 534 U.S. at 28. In the course of its analysis,
the Court observed that, “[i]f [a] consumer habitually
paid her bills on time,” a denial of her credit application
“might well lead her to suspect a prior credit agency
error,” thereby placing her on “inquiry notice” so long
as “a reasonable person in her position would have
learned of the injury in the exercise of due diligence.”
Id. at 30. The decision in TRW does not suggest that a
potential plaintiff can be placed on “inquiry notice” even
though she has no reason to suspect that a statutory
violation has occurred. Rather, the Court simply recognized that the requisite suspicion may be based on reasonable inferences from the totality of the circumstances
(e.g., an unexplained denial of credit to an applicant who
has “habitually paid her bills on time”) even in the absence of direct evidence of the defendant’s wrongdoing.
Similarly in the securities-fraud context, circumstances may often arise in which an innocent mistake is
inherently unlikely, so that information giving rise to a
suspicion of falsehood will itself give rise to a suspicion
of fraud. In particular, when a “representation is false
for reasons likely to have been within the knowledge of
the company when making it, investors upon learning of
the falsity should smell the possibility of fraud.” Law v.
Medco Research, Inc., 113 F.3d 781,785 (7th Cir. 1997)
(Posner, J.); see, e.g., Mathews, 260 F.3d at 252-255; Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito Aguada v. Kidder, Pea-

30

body & Co., 129 F.3d 222, 224 (1st Cir. 1997). But that
is not necessarily the case when the inaccurate statement concerns information that is external to the
declarant—such as information about “a customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, or other outsider”—or events
that might “have arisen after the representation was
made.” Law, 113 F.3d at 785. In the latter case, such as
when a prediction about the future does not come to
pass, facts demonstrating the original statement to have
been inaccurate will not necessarily suggest that the
statement was fraudulent when made.8
C. Section 1658(b)(1) Does Not Bar Respondents’ Claims

1. The court of appeals correctly held that the FDA
Warning Letter did not put respondents on “inquiry notice” of possible securities fraud because that letter did
not suggest that Merck had made knowing misstatements about the safety of Vioxx. The FDA Warning
Letter charged Merck with promotional activities for
the medicine that were “false, lacking in fair balance, or
otherwise misleading in violation of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act.” J.A. 339. The FDA determined that Merck had “selectively present[ed]” the
naproxen hypothesis while “fail[ing] to disclose that
[the] explanation is hypothetical, has not been demonstrated by substantial evidence, and that there is another reasonable explanation, that Vioxx may have prothrombotic properties.” J.A. 340.

8

The fact that information was within a defendant's control will not
necessarily lead a reasonable investor to suspect scienter; inquiry notice depends on the circumstances of each case. See Dodds, 12 F.3d at
350; Mathews, 260 F.3d at 251. For example, an accounting restatement would not automatically give rise to inquiry notice.

31

In making those criticisms, the FDA did not conclude
that the naproxen hypothesis was untrue or even unlikely, or that Merck did not believe in it. Rather, the
FDA recognized the naproxen hypothesis as “a possible
explanation” for the known data, but faulted Merck for
emphasizing that theory while ignoring the alternative
—that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attack. J.A. 340.
Such slanted or incomplete discussions of the pertinent
medical evidence, when directed at doctors who must
decide whether to prescribe a drug, is of great concern
to the FDA. An issuer of securities, however, does not
engage in fraud or deceit by failing to give equal attention to a competing theory in all its public utterances
simply because the issuer’s explanation ultimately turns
out to be wrong. And because the public record already
showed that there were competing explanations of the
available data and that neither had been substantiated,
J.A. 291-292, the FDA’s admonition that the naproxen
hypothesis remained unproven provided respondents
with no additional information bearing on their investment decisions.
2. Even if the FDA letter had placed respondents
on “inquiry notice,” their current claims would still be
timely. As explained above, constructive “discovery
of the facts constituting the violation,” 28 U.S.C.
1658(b)(1), is deemed to occur at the time when a reasonably diligent investor would have unearthed facts
establishing each element of a statutory violation with
sufficient specificity to file an adequate complaint—not
when the investor would have started investigating.
Even assuming that the FDA letter would have led a
reasonably diligent investor to suspect that Merck did
not actually believe the naproxen hypothesis, petitioners
identify no means by which respondents could have con-

32

firmed that suspicion by an independent inquiry. The
only apparent ways for an investor to ascertain whether
petitioners’ expression of confidence in the naproxen
hypothesis was genuinely held would be to gain access
to internal corporate documents or to conduct a scientific study of Vioxx to determine whether Merck could
possibly believe what it was saying. An investor need
not display the skills of a private detective or research
chemist, however, in order to exercise reasonable diligence in investigating and pursuing possible securitiesfraud claims. And “[i]t is obviously unreasonable to
charge the plaintiff with failure to search for the missing
element of the cause of action if such element would not
have been revealed by such search.” TRW, 534 U.S.
at 30 (citing 2 Calvin Corman, Limitation of Actions
§ 11.1.6, at 164 (1991)).
Indeed, even the district court, which held that respondents’ claims were barred by Section 1658(b)(1), did
not suggest that respondents could have discovered
facts constituting a securities violation by November 6,
2001—i.e., two years before the complaint was filed on
November 6, 2003. Rather, the court stated (without
meaningful explanation) that “a reasonable investor
would have discovered the basis for his fraud claims
against Merck with respect to alleged misrepresentations about VIOXX within the two years following the
storm warnings” that the court determined arose by
October 9, 2001. Pet. App. 85a, 98a (emphasis added).
Even if that assessment were well-founded, it would
provide no basis for concluding that respondents should
have had “discovery of the facts constituting the violation” by November 6, 2001, less than a month after the
“storm warnings” arose.
