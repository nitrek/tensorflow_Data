AMENDED PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed
amended plan of distribution (the “Amended Plan of Distribution”) for the distribution of
monies paid in the above-captioned matter.
On August 16, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against
North East Capital, LLC and Anthony T. Vicidomine (collectively, “Respondents”).1 The
Order found that Vicidomine was the founder and sole principal of North East Capital, LLC,
an unregistered investment adviser and general partner of the North East Capital Fund LP.
The Order further found, among other things, that from November 2011 through March 2012,
Vicidomine misappropriated $189,415 of the North East Fund’s assets in the form of unearned
“incentive fees.” Respondents were ordered to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of
$189,415, prejudgment interest of $6,717.04, and a civil money penalty of $150,000, and have
paid $346,892 to the Commission.
The Order created a fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended, for the funds paid by the Respondents (the “Fair Fund”). The Fair Fund is
subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Fair Fund has
been deposited in an account at the United States Department of Treasury.

On December 23, 2014, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment2 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.3 The Notice advised interested
persons that they could obtain a copy of the proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) from the
Commission’s public website at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm or by
submitting a written request to Nancy Chase Burton, Esq., United States Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Plan could submit
their comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice (1) to the
Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE,
Washington, DC 20549-1090; (2) by using the Commission’s Internet comment form
(http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml); or (3) by sending an email to rulecomments@sec.gov. On December 23, 2014, the Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority,
issued the Notice.4 Two comments were submitted, one from Eiszel Lee on December 29,
2014 and one from Annette DeLorenzo (“DeLorenzo”) on February 10, 2015. Only
DeLorenzo’s comment concerned the inclusion of an additional recipient in the distribution
plan.
The Commission has amended the Distribution Plan to include DeLorenzo (“Amended
Plan of Distribution”). The Fair Fund is comprised of $346,671 paid by the Respondents to
the Commission. As set forth in paragraph 5 of the Amended Plan of Distribution, the Plan
seeks to distribute the net Fair Fund to certain investors identified by Commission staff during
its investigation who were harmed by Respondents’ misappropriation of the unearned
“incentive fees” described in the Commission’s Order in Section III. Summary and paragraph
8. The proposed methodology for calculating eligible investors’ estimated net distribution
amounts is set forth in paragraph 7 of the Amended Plan of Distribution.
