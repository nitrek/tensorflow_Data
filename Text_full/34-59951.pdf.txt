File No. 3-13199
In the Matter of
CORNERSTONE CAPITAL
MANAGEMENT, INC., and
LAURA JEAN KENT,

ORDER GRANTING EXTENSION OF
TIME TO FILE PROPOSED PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION

Respondents.
The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time, until June 18,
2009, to file a proposed Plan of Distribution (“distribution plan”) under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In this request, the Division states that since the issuance of the Commission’s March 20,
2009 Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
Pursuant to Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment
Advisers Act Release No. 2855), the staff has diligently worked with the Respondents and with the
Division’s Office of Collections, Distributions, and Financial Management in developing the
distribution plan but encountered unexpected delays in finalizing the distribution plan. The Division
further states that, upon receipt of certain information from Respondents, it expects to submit the
distribution plan no later than June 18, 2009.

For good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s request for an
extension of time to file the proposed plan of distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
