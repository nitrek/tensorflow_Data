STATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT
The Securities and Exchange Commission, amicus curiae, requests that if
the Court orders oral argument the Court also grant the Commission permission to
participate in oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 29(g). The Commission’s
participation in oral argument would help the Court address issues presented by
this private action under the federal securities laws.
The Commission also seeks permission to participate in oral argument
because the Commission has a civil enforcement action pending in the same
district court that entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff here, alleging that these
same defendants violated in a similar manner the same antifraud provisions at issue
in this appeal. See SEC v. Stiefel Laboratories Inc., et al., No. 11-cv-24438
(S.D. Fl., Miami Division).
Should the Court find it necessary, counsel for plaintiff has agreed to cede a
portion of its oral argument time to the Commission.

I.

Misrepresentations are “deceptive” and violate Section 10(b) whether or
not there is also a breach of a duty to disclose.

II.

Both defendants had a duty to correct and update their prior statements
where their failure to do so would render those statements materially
misleading, and Stiefel Lab had a duty to disclose or abstain when
repurchasing shares from its stockholder-employees on the basis of
material, non-public information.

B.

Stiefel Lab had a duty to disclose or abstain when repurchasing
shares from stockholder-employees on the basis of material,
non-public information, and there was no legal impediment to its
satisfaction of that duty.
1.

9

Generally, a corporation is considered an insider with regard
to its duty to either disclose or abstain when purchasing its
own shares on the basis of material, non-public
information.

2.

10

In particular, a privately held corporation repurchasing its
shares from its stockholder-employees on the basis of
material, non-public information has a duty to disclose that
information to sellers or abstain from such repurchases.

3.

14

State law is not determinative of the duty to disclose or
abstain under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

Although a merger is an event of significant magnitude, affirming the

Affirming the jury’s presumed finding that the pre-merger
discussions in this case were material does not mean that all
pre-merger discussions are material as a matter of law.

B.

Under the probability/magnitude standard for materiality,
a merger is an event of significant magnitude.

INTEREST OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
The Securities and Exchange Commission is the agency principally
responsible for the enforcement of the federal securities laws, and submits this
brief as amicus curiae pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 29(a) to address the proper
interpretation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.
78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5. “[M]eritorious private
actions to enforce federal antifraud securities laws are an essential supplement” to
civil enforcement actions brought by the Commission. Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor
Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 313, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 2504 (2007).
Furthermore, the Commission has a specific interest in the proper
construction of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in this private action because the
Commission has a pending enforcement action in the same district court alleging
that these same defendants violated in a similar manner these same antifraud
provisions. See SEC v. Stiefel Laboratories Inc., et al., No. 11-cv-24438 (S.D. Fl.,
Miami Division). Among other things, the Commission’s complaint alleges that
Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a privately held corporation, and Charles W. Stiefel,
Stiefel Lab’s chairman, CEO, and majority shareholder, violated the antifraud
provisions by making material misstatements and omissions as part of a scheme to
accelerate buybacks of stock under Stiefel Lab’s employee stock ownership plan
1

from its current and former employees (“stockholder-employees”) at severely
undervalued prices and then sell Stiefel Lab at a substantial premium. See SEC v.
Stiefel at Dkt. 1. The Commission’s action is based on investors who sold their
shares from November 2006 to April 2009, while the private action is based on one
investor who sold his shares in February 2009.

LEGAL ISSUES ADDRESSED
1. Deception: Whether a material misrepresentation would be sufficient to
satisfy the deception requirement of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, whether or
not there is also a breach of a duty to disclose.
2. Duty:
(a) Whether there is a duty to correct and update prior statements
where the failure to do so would render those statements materially misleading.
(b) Whether a privately held corporation repurchasing its shares from its
stockholder-employees on the basis of material, non-public information has a duty
to disclose that information or abstain from such repurchases.
3. Materiality: Whether the Court can uphold the jury’s presumed finding
that pre-merger discussions were material under the particular facts of this case
without endorsing a bright-line standard under which all pre-merger discussions
are material as a matter of law.
2

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
The Commission submits this amicus brief to correct erroneous legal
propositions that defendants assert regarding three issues.
1. Defendants incorrectly assume that material misrepresentations would be
insufficient to establish fraud unless there is also a breach of a duty of disclosure.
Misrepresentations satisfy the deception requirement of Section 10(b) whether or
not there is also a breach of an independent duty to disclose.
2. Defendants erroneously contend that they owed no duty to refrain from
making material omissions under Section 10(b).
(a) Stiefel Lab and Charles Stiefel had a duty to correct and update their
prior statements where their failure to do so would render those statements
materially misleading.
(b) A privately held corporation such as Stiefel Lab has a duty to disclose or
abstain when repurchasing its shares from its stockholder-employees on the basis
of material non-public information, and no legal impediment prevented Stiefel
Lab’s compliance with that duty.
3. Defendants erroneously argue that upholding the jury’s implicit finding
that certain pre-merger discussions were material would require the Court to
endorse an overinclusive, bright-line standard under which all pre-merger
3

discussions are material as a matter of law. Rather, only material merger
discussions need to be disclosed, and materiality is a fact-specific inquiry that
depends on the facts and circumstances in any particular case.

ARGUMENT
I.

Misrepresentations are “deceptive” and violate Section 10(b) whether or
not there is also a breach of a duty to disclose.
Defendants argue that a “duty to disclose” is an “essential element” of an

action for securities fraud. Br. 1-2; see also Br. 14-26.1 This erroneously suggests
that misrepresentations are insufficient to establish a violation of Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 unless there is also a breach of an independent duty of disclosure, such
as a fiduciary or similar duty. Although plaintiff’s private cause of action was not
tried on the basis of alleged misrepresentations (Pl. Br. 14), it is an important
principle of federal securities law that, if a person makes material
misrepresentations, the deception requirement of Section 10(b) is satisfied without
regard to whether that person has an independent duty to disclose. And as noted,
the Commission’s enforcement action alleges that Stiefel Lab and Charles Stiefel
made material misrepresentations.
Section 10(b) makes it unlawful for any person “[t]o use or employ, in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security * * * any manipulative or
1

All emphasis is added unless otherwise noted.
4

deceptive device or contrivance.” 15 U.S.C. 78j(b). Rule 10b-5, which was
promulgated pursuant to Section 10(b), broadly prohibits “any” artifice to defraud,
“any” untrue misstatement or omission, and “any” deceit. 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5.
These antifraud provisions, “by statute and rule, are broad and, by repeated use of
the word ‘any,’ are obviously meant to be inclusive.” Affiliated Ute Citizens of
Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 151, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 1471 (1972). They are
read “flexibly” to effectuate their “remedial purposes,” namely “to insure honest
securities markets and thereby promote investor confidence.” SEC v. Zandford,
535 U.S. 813, 819, 122 S.Ct. 1899, 1903 (2002).
These antifraud provisions reach both misrepresentations and—where there
is a duty—omissions. See Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. ScientificAtlanta, Inc., 552 U.S. 148, 157, 128 S.Ct. 761, 768 (2008) (Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 proscribe “a material misrepresentation or omission”). Furthermore,
“an affirmative misrepresentation is a distinct species of fraud” that is sufficient to
violate Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, “[e]ven if a person does not have a fiduciary
duty to disclose.” SEC v. Dorozhko, 574 F.3d 42, 49 (2d Cir. 2009). Accord
Semerenko v. Cendant Corp., 223 F.3d 165, 187 n.14 (3d Cir. 2000); Ackerman v.
Schwartz, 947 F.2d 841, 848 (7th Cir. 1991) (“the lack of an independent duty does
not excuse a material lie”).
5

II.

Both defendants had a duty to correct and update their prior statements
where their failure to do so would render those statements materially
misleading, and Stiefel Lab had a duty to disclose or abstain when
repurchasing shares from its stockholder-employees on the basis of
material, non-public information.
In addition to misrepresentations, omissions or silence can also be deceptive

under Section 10(b) where the failure to speak breaches a duty to disclose. See
Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 226-30, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 1113-16 (1980)
(discussing duty to disclose arising from “fiduciary or similar relation”). Although
defendants argue that they had no such duty, as discussed below, this case
implicates two distinct duties of disclosure: (a) Stiefel Lab and Charles Stiefel
both had a duty to correct and update their prior statements where their failure to
do so would render those statements materially misleading; and (b) Stiefel Lab had
a duty to disclose or abstain when purchasing its shares from its stockholderemployees on the basis of material, non-public information.
A.

Stiefel Lab and Charles Stiefel had a duty to correct and update
their prior statements where their failure to do so would render
those statements materially misleading.

“A duty to disclose may also be created by a defendant’s previous decision
to speak voluntarily. Where a defendant’s failure to speak would render the
defendant’s own prior speech misleading or deceptive, a duty to disclose arises.”
Rudolph v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 800 F.2d 1040, 1043 (11th Cir. 1986), original
6

emphasis; see also FindWhat Investor Grp., v. FindWhat.com, 658 F.3d 1282,
1298-1299, 1305-06 (11th Cir. 2011). Prior statements can implicate both a duty
to correct and a duty to update. There is a duty to correct prior statements believed
to be true when made, if it is revealed that those statements were in fact inaccurate
when made and those statements would be materially misleading absent correction.
See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1430-31 (3d Cir.
1997); Backman v. Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d 10, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1990) (en banc).
And there is also a duty to update statements that were accurate when made, if
those statements no longer reflect the true facts and would be materially
misleading absent updating. See Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1432; Backman v.
Polaroid, 910 F.2d at 16-17; In re Time Warner Inc. Sec. Litig., 9 F.3d 259, 267
(2d Cir. 1993).
Stiefel Lab and Charles Stiefel had a duty to correct and update their prior
statements regarding the value of Stiefel Lab’s shares where their failure to do so
would render those statements materially misleading. Before the end of each
calendar year, Stiefel Lab and Charles Stiefel announced the “current fair market
value” of Stiefel Lab shares as of March 31 of that year until April 1 of the next
year. Pl. Br. 21 (quoting Stiefel Lab’s employee stock ownership plan, PX 56 at
43, included in plaintiff’s supplemental record excerpts); see also Pl. Br. 3-4;
7

Br. 16. That was the price that would be paid to stockholder-employees under
Stiefel Lab’s employee stock ownership plan. Defendants had a duty to correct
any valuation that was incorrect when made because, for example, the valuation
failed to reflect contemporaneous, material merger negotiations (Pl. Br. 5-9) or
other offers to purchase Stiefel Lab’s shares at materially higher prices (Pl. Br. 21,
6). See Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1430-31.
Even if the valuation was correct when made, defendants also had a duty to
update their prior statements regarding the valuation, if there was an event after the
valuation was announced—and during the year the valuation was in effect—that
made that valuation materially inaccurate, such as material merger discussions
(Pl. Br. 5-9), or a private equity firm purchasing a significant number of shares at a
materially higher price (Pl. Br. 21, 6). Here, defendants’ duty to update the
valuation is especially clear because they represented that the “fair market value”
of Stiefel Lab’s shares would be redetermined “from time to time as may be
necessary.” See PX 56 at 60. Accordingly, the valuation “remained ‘alive’ in the
minds of investors as a continuing representation” that defendants had a duty to
update if it became materially inaccurate. Burlington, 114 F.3d at 1432.

8

Stiefel Lab and Charles Stiefel also had a duty to correct and update their
prior statements that Stiefel Lab was not for sale but would instead remain a
privately held company (Pl. Br. 4-5, 16-18), where their failure to do so would
render those statements materially misleading. They had a duty to correct their
statements that Stiefel Lab was not for sale if they learned that, at the time such
statements were made, Stiefel Lab was in fact for sale. See Burlington, 114 F.3d
at 1430-31. And to the extent their representations that Stiefel Lab was not for sale
and would remain a privately held company “remained ‘alive’ in the minds of
investors as a continuing representation” (id. at 1432), defendants had a duty to
update those representations if material merger negotiations with a public company
ensued.
B.

Stiefel Lab had a duty to disclose or abstain when repurchasing
shares from stockholder-employees on the basis of material,
non-public information, and there was no legal impediment to its
satisfaction of that duty.

Although defendants are correct that a company generally has no affirmative
duty under the federal securities laws to disclose any and all material information
(Br. 14-15), where a company trades in its own stock it does have a duty to

9

disclose material information or abstain from trading. 2 This duty is especially
clear in the context of this case, where a privately held corporation such as Stiefel
Lab repurchases its own shares from its stockholder-employees. 3 The duty to
disclose or abstain is vital where the corporation’s shares are not publicly traded
and the corporation exercises control over the market for its shares: it is essentially
the only buyer, it establishes the price, and the stockholder-employees must agree
to that price in order to sell their shares. This duty to disclose or abstain is not
confined to issuers that are close corporations. Nor does this duty depend on state
law. Finally, a privately held corporation such as Stiefel Lab is not legally barred
from fulfilling its duty to either disclose or abstain.
1.

Generally, a corporation is considered an insider with
regard to its duty to either disclose or abstain when
purchasing its own shares on the basis of material,
non-public information.

Just as officers and directors are insiders with an affirmative duty to disclose
or abstain when purchasing shares on the basis of material, non-public
2

A company also has a duty to disclose under certain other circumstances, such as
the aforementioned duty to correct and update, or where a company is responsible
for leaks into the market (e.g., State Teachers Retirement Bd. v. Fluor Corp.,
654 F.2d 843, 850 (2d Cir. 1981)), or where regulations promulgated by the
Commission require disclosure (e.g., share registration statements under the
Securities Act of 1933, proxy solicitations under the Exchange Act).

Plaintiff did not argue that Charles Stiefel violated a duty to disclose or abstain in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security. Pl. Br. 25 n.9.

information,4 it is well established that “the corporate issuer in possession of
material nonpublic information, must, like other insiders in the same situation,
disclose that information to its shareholders or refrain from trading with them.”
McCormick v. Fund American Co., Inc., 26 F.3d 869, 875-76 (9th Cir. 1994),
collecting authorities. See also Shaw v. Digital Equipment Corp., 82 F.3d 1194,
1203-1204 (1st Cir. 1996) (“Just as an individual insider with material nonpublic
information about pending merger or license negotiations could not purchase his
company’s securities without making disclosure, the company itself may not
engage in such a purchase of its own stock, if it is in possession of such
undisclosed information.”), citing Rogen v. Ilikon Corp., 361 F.2d 260, 266-68
(1st Cir. 1966); Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F.2d 741, 746 (6th Cir. 1986), vacated
on other grounds, 485 U.S. 224, 108 S. Ct. 978 (1988) (“[c]ourts have held that a
duty to disclose [merger] negotiations arises in situations, such as where the
corporation is trading in its own stock”); Kohler v. Kohler Co., 319 F.2d 634, 638
(7th Cir. 1963) (the “underlying principles” regarding trading on inside
information “apply not only to majority stockholders of corporations and corporate
insiders, but equally to corporations themselves”).

4

See Chiarella, 445 U.S. at 227-28, 100 S.Ct. at 1114-15; SEC v. Adler, 137 F.3d
1325, 1333-34 (11th Cir. 1998).
11

The rationale for imposing a duty to disclose or abstain is “the necessity of
preventing a corporate insider from . . . taking unfair advantage of the uninformed
minority stockholders.” Chiarella, 445 U.S. at 228-29, 100 S.Ct. at 1114-1115,
brackets in original, citation omitted. This rationale applies to corporate officers,
directors, and the corporation itself, when they trade in the corporation’s securities.
Leading commentators agree that “[t]he term insider traditionally has been
held to include * * * issuers when repurchasing their own stock,” because “the
issuer attempting to repurchase its own shares is the insider par excellence.” Loss,
Seligman and Paredes, Securities Regulation, Chapter 9(B)(5) (May 2013),
quotation omitted. See also Donald C. Langevoort, Who is an insider?—The issuer
itself, 18 Insider Trading Regulation, Enforcement and Prevention § 3:6 (April
2013); Thomas Lee Hazen, Corporate Affirmative Disclosure Obligations, 4 Law
Sec. Reg. § 12.19[1][B] (Jan. 2013).
Other rules promulgated pursuant to Section 10(b) demonstrate that issuers
trading in their own stock have a duty to disclose or abstain. For example,
Rule 10b-18 provides an issuer with a “‘safe harbor’ from liability” under
Rule 10b-5 under certain circumstances when the issuer is repurchasing its own
stock. 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-18. But, as the Commission has explained, this Rule
“confers no immunity from possible Rule 10b-5 liability where the issuer engages
12

in repurchases while in possession of favorable, material non-public information
concerning its securities.” Purchases of Certain Equity Securities by the Issuer
and Others, Release No. 33-6434, 1982 WL 33916 at *2, *16 n.5 (Nov. 17, 1982).
Because this duty is implicated only where the defendant corporation trades
in its own stock, defendants’ reliance (Br. 15, 17-18) on cases where the defendant
corporation did not trade in its own stock is misplaced. See Glazer v. Formica
Corp., 964 F.2d 149, 157 (2d Cir. 1992) (“There was no suggestion that defendants
were trading in Formica stock.”); McCormick, 26 F.3d at 876-77 & n.4
(distinguishing both Glazer and Taylor v. First Union Corp., 857 F.2d 240, 24344, 246-47 (4th Cir. 1988), on this basis). Defendants mistakenly rely on Jackvony
v. RIHT Fin. Corp., 873 F.2d 411, 417 (1st Cir. 1989), which not only rejects
defendants’ position, but also articulates the Commission’s position: a
“corporation has no affirmative duty to disclose even material information if there
is no insider trading, no statute or regulation requiring disclosure, and no
inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading prior disclosure.” Finally, this Court’s
decision in Williams v. Dresser Indus., Inc. is inapposite because the plaintiffs
there did not buy any securities, rather they “bought a distributorship of heavy
construction equipment,” thus “[f]ederal securities law” was “not controlling.”
120 F.3d 1163, 1165-67, 1173 (11th Cir. 1997).

2.

In particular, a privately held corporation repurchasing
its shares from its stockholder-employees on the basis of
material, non-public information has a duty to disclose that
information to sellers or abstain from such repurchases.

The duty to disclose or abstain is especially clear where, as here, a privately
held corporation repurchases its own, non-publicly traded shares from its
stockholder-employees. Indeed, this Court in Smith v. Duff & Phelps affirmed a
privately held company’s liability under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 for
intentionally making material omissions about its shares’ value when repurchasing
shares from a stockholder-employee. See Smith v. Duff & Phelps, Inc., 891 F.2d
1567 (11th Cir. 1990), rehearing en banc denied, 904 F.2d 712 (11th Cir. 1990);
accord Jordan v. Duff & Phelps, 815 F.2d 429 (7th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485
U.S. 901, 108 S.Ct. 1067 (1988); Castellano v. Young & Rubicam, Inc., 257 F.3d
171, 175, 179 (2d Cir. 2001).
In Smith, the corporate defendant, Duff & Phelps, was a privately held
corporation that repurchased its shares from Smith, a retiring employee, at the
book value of $100 per share while failing to disclose material merger negotiations
that resulted in a buyout at over $2,000 per share. 891 F.2d at 1568-69. This
Court affirmed that Duff & Phelps was liable under the antifraud provisions for
this omission because the “corporation has a duty under the federal securities laws
to disclose to a stockholder-employee facts which might indicate that the stock is
14

worth more than the contractually determined book value.” Id. at 1569, 1573-75.
Likewise, Stiefel Lab had a duty to disclose to its stockholder-employees,
including plaintiff, material facts that indicated its stock was worth more than the
share valuation determined under Stiefel Lab’s employee stock ownership plan.
In response to Smith (Br. 20-26), defendants assert that (i) under Smith only
“close corporations” have a duty to disclose or abstain; and (ii) Stiefel Lab was not
a close corporation because a “close corporation” under the Delaware Code can
have no more than 30 shareholders (8 Del.C. 342), while Stiefel Lab had more than
30 shareholders. Neither assertion withstands scrutiny.
First, the duty found in Smith does not turn on the corporation’s particular
form. Rather, what this Court found important was the corporation’s control over
the market for its shares. 891 F.2d at 1573 & n.15. 5 This Court explained that a
privately held corporation owes a duty to disclose or abstain when purchasing its
shares from its stockholder-employees because that kind of market for
non-publicly traded shares is “under corporate control.” Id. This Court noted that
in such a case the “corporation is the only potential buyer at the time of

5

See also Affiliated Ute, 406 U.S. at 144-54, 92 S.Ct. at 1467-72 (corporate
defendant’s control over the market for non-publicly traded shares established the
corporation’s duty under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 to “disclos[e] to [sellers]
material facts that reasonably could have been expected to influence their decision
to sell,” including “that their shares were selling for a higher price in that market”).
15

termination,” and the corporation “has the luxury of establishing the sale value of
the stock.” Id. Stiefel Lab had that sort of market control. Pl. Br. 22 n.6; PX 56.
Because in these circumstances stockholder-employees who wish to sell their
shares are at the mercy of the corporation to buy them, and to buy them at a fair
price, the corporation has an obligation to disclose information that materially
affects that price or abstain from purchasing its shares at that unfair price. A
corporation’s control in this manner over the market for its non-publicly traded
shares—irrespective of whether it is privately held or closely held—provides an
opportunity for the corporation to abuse its control by profiting at the expense of
stockholder-employees they have intentionally left in the dark. 6 This rationale
underlies the decision in Smith. 891 F.2d at 1574-75 (noting that “opportunism”
and “inequitable” results would abound absent the duty to disclose or abstain). 7

6

The privately held and closely held corporation both have an incentive to require
stockholder-employees to sell at an artificially low price, and thereby reduce the
corporation’s cost of acquiring shares.
7

Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 apply to “any person,” and the definition of
“person” under the Exchange Act encompasses a “company” of any form. Section
3(a)(9), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(9). In preventing and remedying fraud through these
provisions, it makes no difference whether the corporate defendant that commits
fraud is organized as a closely held corporation, privately held corporation,
partnership, joint-stock company, etc. See supra at 5.
16

The Second Circuit in Castellano v. Young & Rubicam expressly held that
the rule that “closed corporations that purchase their own stock have a special
obligation to disclose to sellers all material information” applies to a “privatelyheld corporation, owned by a select group of employees.” 257 F.3d at 175, 179
(“one of the largest” stockholder-employees owned only “1.2% of all outstanding
equity”), citing Jordan, 815 F.2d at 434-35 and McCormick, 26 F.3d at 876.
Where the privately held corporate defendant bought the stockholder-employee’s
shares at $49, and executed a merger four months later at $115 per share (257 F.3d
at 175-76), the court of appeals concluded that the corporation had a duty to
disclose material merger negotiations and adjusted valuations (id. at 179-186).
Castellano relied on the corporation’s control over the market for its shares:
“[t]here was no public market for Y & R’s stock,” “no shares could be sold or
transferred without first offering them to Y & R,” and the stockholder-employee
“had no power to bargain over the valuation of his shares.” Id. at 175, 184.
Accordingly, the Commission has concluded that “under Section 10(b) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act, a privately-held
company may be liable for material misrepresentations or materially misleading
omissions when repurchasing securities from its shareholders.” Order Granting an

17

Application of BF Enterprises, Inc., Release No. 34-66541, 2012 WL 759371, at
*6 n.42 (Mar. 8, 2012).
Finally, in Shaw and Levinson (see supra at 11), the corporate defendants
that the courts of appeals concluded had a duty to disclose or abstain were not
close corporations; in fact, they were not even privately held. See Shaw v. Digital
Equipment Corp., 82 F.3d at 1199 (Digital Equipment Corporation was a “publicly
held company”); Levinson v. Basic, 786 F.2d at 743 (“Basic’s stock was traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.”). The courts of appeals in McCormick and Rogen
(supra at 11) did not even mention whether the corporate defendants in those cases
were close corporations, so there is no basis for concluding that those decisions
turned on that fact. Thus, defendants are incorrect in their contention that only
“close” corporations are required to disclose or abstain.
In any event, Stiefel Lab can be characterized as a closely held corporation.
“The term ‘close corporation’ has been defined in various ways. It is often used to
distinguish and set apart the corporation with only a few shareholders from the
‘public-issue’ or publicly held corporation. * * * Another popular definition states
that a close corporation is a corporation whose shares are not generally traded in
the securities market.” O’Neal & Thompson, 1 Close Corp and LLCs: Law and
Practice § 1:2 (Rev. 3d ed. Nov. 2012); cf. Jelke v. C.I.R., 507 F.3d 1317, 1322
18

(11th Cir. 2007) (closely held corporations include corporations whose “shares are
traded little, if any, in the marketplace”). Indeed, Smith employs the term “closely
held corporations” to distinguish from “public corporations” (891 F.2d at 1574);
Stiefel Lab was not a public corporation (Br. 1). Moreover, the definition of a
statutory “close corporation” under state law, such as 8 Del.C. 342, is not
determinative, in part because “the number of statutory close corporations is a
small fraction of the number of corporations that fall within the other close
corporation definitions.” O’Neal & Thompson, 1 Close Corp and LLCs: Law and
Practice § 1:4. See also infra at 19-22.
3.

State law is not determinative of the duty to disclose or
abstain under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

Contrary to defendants’ contentions (Br. 20-22), because the Exchange Act
is a federal statute, whether Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 impose a duty to disclose
or abstain is a federal question and does not turn on the application of any one
state’s law. The Supreme Court instructs that “the antifraud provisions of the
securities laws are not coextensive with common law doctrines of fraud,” because
“an important purpose of the federal securities statutes was to rectify perceived
deficiencies in the available common law protections.” Herman & MacLean v.
Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 388-89, 103 S.Ct. 683, 691 (1983). This Court has
likewise explained that “[i]n exploring the question of whether a duty to disclose
19

exists in a particular situation, federal courts must go beyond state common law,
and conduct an inquiry into relevant federal sources of authority.” Langford v. Rite
Aid of Alabama, Inc., 231 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir. 2000) (mail and wire fraud).
Looking to federal law here does not result in any purported (Br. 21)
“entanglement with state law.” Laird v. Integrated Resources, Inc., 897 F.2d 826,
836-37 (5th Cir. 1990). Since the duty to disclose or abstain found in federal court
of appeals decisions interpreting Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 reflects a
“developed federal standard it does not require reference to state corporate and
securities law or the state law of fiduciary relationship,” courts “may refer to these
cases instead of state analogies,” and “because state law is not considered,
uniformity is promoted.” Id. Indeed, exclusive reliance on state law would result
in an undesirable lack of uniformity. See Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &
Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350, 357-361, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 2779-2781 (1991)
(recognizing the need for uniform rules under the federal securities laws).
In any event, even under Delaware state law (Stiefel Lab was incorporated in
Delaware, Br. 20), a corporation repurchasing its shares cannot fraudulently omit
material facts affecting their value. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has not

20

directly addressed this issue,8 Delaware Chancery Courts have found that a
corporation has a disclosure duty when repurchasing its shares. In Eisenberg v.
Chicago Milwaukee Corp., the Delaware Court found that “an issuer making a
tender offer for its own shares is ‘the most inside of insiders’ and ‘the insider par
excellence,’” and thus has a duty to ensure that sellers are “fully, candidly and
accurately informed of all material facts.” 537 A.2d 1051, 1057-60, 13 Del. J.
Corp. L. 1131, 1142-47 (Del. Ch. 1987) (granting preliminary injunction against
corporate defendant), quoting Broder v. Dane, 384 F. Supp. 1312, 1318-1319
(S.D.N.Y. 1974). See also In re Oracle Corp., 867 A.2d 904, 936-940, 30 Del. J.
Corp. L. 568 (Del. Ch. 2004), aff’d, 872 A.2d 960 (Del. 2005) (while corporations
do not have a “general obligation” to disclose material information, “the disclose
or abstain doctrine applies to issuers as well as to corporate insiders who wish to
trade”), citing Shaw, 82 F.3d 1194 (1st Cir.). Notably, these Delaware state law
cases look to federal law.
8

In Arnold v. Society for Savings Bancorp, Inc., 678 A.2d 533, 65 USLW 2042
(1996), the Delaware Supreme Court recognized that while a corporation has no
general duty under Delaware law to disclose any and all material information,
under Delaware law a “disclosure duty owed by the corporation to its shareholder”
can be “predicated upon a theory of legal or equitable fraud.” 678 A.2d at 539 &
n.11. In rejecting a state law claim arising out of a proxy statement, Arnold
explained that even if a corporation is found not to have a disclosure duty under
Delaware law, that corporation may have a disclosure duty under federal securities
statutes that broadly apply to “any person.” Id. at 539, discussing Section 14(a) of
the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78n(a)(1).
21

Defendants suggest that under Delaware law the duty to disclose or abstain
does not apply to any corporation unless it qualifies as a “close corporation” as
defined by a Delaware statute, by having 30 or fewer shareholders. Br. 20-21,
citing Nixon v. Blackwell, 626 A.2d 1366, 1379-80 (Del. 1993) and 8 Del.C. 342
(defining a statutory “close corporation” as a corporation with no more than 30
shareholders). Defendants are wrong for several reasons. First, Nixon is
inapposite because it does not address a corporation’s duty to its stockholderemployees or the duty to disclose or abstain. 626 A.2d at 1373-74, 1377, 1380-81.
Second, Nixon itself makes plain that whether the corporation at issue is a
“statutory close corporation” under the Delaware Code is not determinative. Id. at
1380 n.19, discussing 8 Del.C. 342; see also 8 Del.C. 356 (Delaware’s close
corporation statute does not repeal “any statute or rule of law which is or would be
applicable to any corporation”). Third, the corporate defendants in Eisenberg and
Oracle were not closely held; their shares were publicly traded. See Eisenberg,
537 A.2d at 1053, 13 Del. J. Corp. L. at 1135; Oracle, 867 A.2d at 907-909.
Finally, defendants’ position so elevates form over substance as to confer a duty to
disclose or abstain on a corporation composed of 30 shareholders, but not on a
corporation composed of 31 shareholders—a plainly unreasonable result.

22

4.

A privately held corporation is not legally barred from
fulfilling its duty to either disclose or abstain when
repurchasing its shares from its stockholder-employees on
the basis of material, non-public information.

There is no basis for defendants’ assertion that Stiefel Lab was legally
disabled from either disclosing or abstaining when repurchasing its shares from its
stockholder-employees on the basis of inside information. See Dirks v. SEC, 463
U.S. 646, 653 & n.12, 103 S.Ct. 3255, 3260-61 & n.12 (1983).
a.

Disclosure

Privately held corporations repurchasing their shares can disclose material
information to seller stockholder-employees prior to buying back their shares.
Disclosure would enable a stockholder-employee to make an investment decision
on the basis of information important to making that decision. Contrary to
defendants’ contentions, this would not necessarily require a “public” disclosure
that could potentially be disruptive of, for example, a potential merger (Br. 17,
22-26), as disclosure needs to be made “only to the person whose stock is to be
acquired.” Jordan, 815 F.2d at 431, 434 (“the firm need tell only the few investors
from whom it buys stock during the negotiations”). There is no reason why
privately held corporations, unlike close corporations, are somehow powerless to
“extract promises of confidentiality” from seller stockholder-employees, or why
such agreements require literally “face-to-face” negotiations. Br. 24-25. Such
23

confidentiality agreements can bind even former employees or non-employees.
E.g., Roton Barrier, Inc. v. Stanley Works, 79 F.3d 1112, 1115-19 (Fed Cir. 1996).
By signing such a confidentiality agreement, former employees or non-employees
thereby also become subject to liability under the federal securities laws should
they disclose the information, such as through tipping, or if they otherwise trade on
the information. See Rule 10b5-2(b)(1), 17 C.F.R. 240.10b5-2(b)(1); SEC v. Yun,
327 F.3d 1263, 1272-73 & n.23 (11th Cir. 2003).
b.

Abstention

Alternatively, privately held corporations can abstain from repurchasing
their shares on the basis of material non-public information. Defendants
erroneously suggest that they were unable to abstain from repurchases due to their
obligations under their employee stock ownership plan and the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Br. 22-23, 36-44. Specifically,
defendants contend that they faced obligations to immediately repurchase shares,
for example from terminated employees, and could not impose a “blackout period”
on such repurchases from stockholder-employees without giving them 30 days’
notice. See Br. 36-44, discussing 29 U.S.C. 1021(i).
But ERISA includes an express exception that permits repurchases to be
suspended without instituting a “blackout period,” and without requiring 30 days’
24

notice, because a “blackout period” does not include “a suspension, limitation, or
restriction which occurs by reason of application of the securities laws (as defined
in section 78c(a)(47) of Title 15).” 29 U.S.C. 1021(i)(7)(B)(i). The disclose-orabstain rule for insider trading fits comfortably within this exception because that
rule is a longstanding “limitation” or “restriction” on purchases and sales of
securities. See United States v. Cassese, 428 F.3d 92, 105 (2d Cir. 2005) (ban on
insider trading is a “trading restriction of Rule 10b-5”); SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur,
401 F.2d 833, 848, 860 (2d Cir. 1968) (en banc) (duty to abstain from trading acts
as a “prohibition against purchases”).9
There is no basis for defendants’ interpretation of this ERISA exception as
applying only to “trading suspensions” specifically authorized by the Commission
due to a crisis or emergency under Section 12(k)(1) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. 78l(k)(1). See Br. 40-41 & n.37. Defendants’ reading is erroneous for
three reasons:

9

Defendants are likewise wrong that the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.
409(h)) prevented them from abstaining because it required Stiefel Lab to
repurchase shares within 60 days from an employee-stockholder’s request to sell.
Br. 43-44. There is an exception for any period during which a company is unable
to honor that request “by applicable Federal or state law.” 26 C.F.R. 54.49757(b)(12)(ii). See also Michael B. Snyder, 3 Compensation and Benefits § 38:104
(May 2013). The disclose-or-abstain rule is applicable federal law and thus falls
within this exception.
25

First, the ERISA exception expressly cross-references the full panoply of
securities laws, including Section 10(b), not just the one subsection of one
Exchange Act provision to which defendants point. See 29 U.S.C. 1021(i)(7)(B)(i)
(exception) and 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47) (definition of “securities laws”). 10
Second, the provision defendants identify refers only to trading
“suspensions.” Defendants’ cramped reading would render surplusage the
statutory terms “limitation” and “restriction.” This offends the “cardinal principle
of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed
that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void,
or insignificant.” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 449
(2001); accord Nat’l Ass’n of State Utility Consumer Advocates v. FCC, 457 F.3d
1238, 1257 (11th Cir. 2006).
Third, defendants’ interpretation would permit employee stock ownership
plans to offer even patently fraudulent investments (e.g., “prime bank”
instruments), for a full 30 days after learning the nature of such investments.
10

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47) provides: “The term ‘securities laws’ means the Securities
Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15
U.S.C. 78a et seq.), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 (15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq.), the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.
80a-1 et seq.), the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b et seq.) [15
U.S.C.A. § 80b-1 et seq.], and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15
U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.).”
26

Defendants’ interpretation would thus require persons to violate the securities laws
and perpetuate a fraud in order to comply with ERISA. Courts have rejected such
an interpretation because ERISA should not be read to encourage fraud and deceit.
See In re Enron Corp. Securities, Derivative & ERISA Litig., 284 F.Supp.2d 511,
565-567 (S.D. Tex. 2003); In re WorldCom, Inc., 263 F.Supp.2d 745, 767
(S.D.N.Y. 2003). See also Rachal Shapiro, et al., ERISA Fiduciary Duties
Regarding 401(k) & ESOP Investments in Employer Stock, SU014 ALI-ABA 113
(Oct. 2012) (“[N]o one—the courts, the DOL [Department of Labor], or the
Securities Exchange Commission (‘SEC’)—would allow fiduciaries or participants
to trade while in the possession of material, nonpublic information.”), original
emphasis. A corporation can instead satisfy its duties under both ERISA and the
securities laws by abstaining from trading. 11

11

The Commission does not seek deference for its interpretation of 29 U.S.C.
1021(i) under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.
837, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984), because this provision—although promulgated as part
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (Section 306)—is
administered by the Department of Labor. See Final Rule Relating to Notice of
Blackout Periods to Participants and Beneficiaries, 68 FR 3716-01, 2003 WL
158515 (Jan. 24, 2003). The Commission’s interpretation is based on the text of
the provision and its interplay with the federal securities laws. Likewise, the
Commission does not seek Chevron deference for its interpretation of 26 U.S.C.
409(h).
27

III.

Although a merger is an event of significant magnitude, affirming the
jury’s verdict here would not require the Court to conclude that all
pre-merger discussions are material as a matter of law.
The Commission will not delve into the facts regarding materiality that were

presented to the jury in this private action because materiality is an “inherently
fact-specific” inquiry (Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 131 S.Ct. 1309, 1318
(2011), quoting Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 236, 108 S.Ct. 978, 986
(1988)), and materiality “assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact,”
(TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 450, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 2133
(1976)). Accord SEC v. Morgan Keegan & Co., Inc., 678 F.3d 1233, 1245-46
(11th Cir. 2012); SEC v. Ginsburg, 362 F.3d 1292, 1302 (11th Cir. 2004). This
brief addresses only: (a) defendants’ erroneous view that upholding the jury’s
presumed finding that the pre-merger discussions here were material would require
this Court to endorse an overinclusive, bright-line standard under which all
pre-merger discussions are material as a matter of law, and (b) defendants’ failure
to recognize that a merger is an event of significant magnitude.
A.

Affirming the jury’s presumed finding that the pre-merger
discussions in this case were material does not mean that all
pre-merger discussions are material as a matter of law.

Defendants err to the extent that they argue that if the Court were to
conclude that there is evidence presented below from which a rational jury could
28

find that the particular merger discussions here were material, then “any
discussions about potential mergers or similar deals” would be material as a matter
of law. Br. 2, original emphasis; Br. 18 (arguing that liability here would require
disclosure of “all preliminary merger discussions”), original emphasis. Only
material merger negotiations need be disclosed, and materiality is a fact-specific
inquiry that depends on the “total mix” of information available “under all the
circumstances” in any particular case. TSC Indus., 426 U.S. at 449-50. As this
Court explained in SEC v. Morgan Keegan, “[w]hether merger discussions in any
particular case are material . . . depends on the facts.” 678 F.3d at 1246, quoting
Basic, 485 U.S. at 239, 108 S.Ct. at 987. Likewise, misrepresentations and
omissions regarding share valuation are actionable only if they are material under
the circumstances. See SEC v. MacDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 48-50 (1st Cir. 1983) (en
banc); SEC v. Merchant Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747, 766-71 (11th Cir. 2007).
B.

Under the probability/magnitude standard for materiality,
a merger is an event of significant magnitude.

Although pre-merger discussions are not per se material, defendants fail to
recognize that with regard to the materiality standard’s balancing of both the
quantitative “probability that the event will occur” and the qualitative “magnitude
of the event” (Basic, 485 U.S. at 238-39, 108 S.Ct. at 987), a merger is an event of
substantial qualitative magnitude. Indeed, the Supreme Court has noted that
29

“a merger in which it is bought out is the most important event that can occur in a
small corporation’s life.” Id., quoting SEC v. Geon Industries, Inc., 531 F.2d 39,
47 (2d Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.). This Court has likewise explained that a “merger
is an event of considerable magnitude to an investor.” Ginsburg, 362 F.3d at 1302.
See also SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 47 (2d Cir. 1998) (materiality of a takeover is
“not open to doubt”); SEC v. Obus, 693 F.3d 276, 289-290 n.3 (2d Cir. 2012)
(“Unannounced acquisitions are a prototypical example of material non-public
information.”); SEC v. Maio, 51 F.3d 623, 628 n.3 (7th Cir. 1995) (same).
Accordingly, discussions regarding a merger “can become material at an earlier
stage than would be the case as regards lesser transactions.” Basic, 485 U.S. at
238, 108 S.Ct. at 987.
