In the Matter of
DAVID S. HALL, P.C.
ORDER ON DIVISION OF
d/b/a THE HALL GROUP CPAs,
ENFORCEMENT’S
DAVID S. HALL, CPA,
MOTIONS IN LIMINE
MICHELLE L. HELTERBRAN COCHRAN, CPA,
and SUSAN A. CISNEROS

On October 11, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed two motions in limine in this
matter: a motion to exclude impermissible defenses and a motion to exclude character evidence.
For the reasons that follow, I will deny the first motion and defer ruling on the second.
A. Motion to Exclude Impermissible Defenses
The Division anticipates that Respondent Michelle L. Helterbran Cochran may present
evidence that Respondent David S. Hall “was a demanding or domineering boss or that she only
engaged in the conduct [alleged in the order instituting proceedings] to preserve her job to
support her family” and that Respondent Susan A. Cisneros may seek to show that Hall “forced
her hand.” Div. Mot. at 2. According to the Division, this evidence should be excluded because
“difficult personal or professional circumstances” do not excuse failure to comply with Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board auditing standards. Id. The Division characterizes this
anticipated evidence as supporting an “improper defense.” Id.
The Division recites auditing standards but cites no authority for why this evidence should
be excluded, but its argument is implicitly based on relevance. Under the Rules of Practice, I
“may receive relevant evidence and shall exclude all evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial,
unduly repetitious, or unreliable.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.320(a); see Amendments to the Commission’s
Rules of Practice, 81 Fed. Reg. 50212, 50229-30 (July 29, 2016). In administrative proceedings,
relevance is construed broadly. Charles P. Lawrence, 43 S.E.C. 607, 612 (1967) (“[T]he generally
accepted view favors liberality in the admission of evidence in administrative proceedings, and
all evidence which ‘can conceivably throw any light upon the controversy’ [should] normally be
admitted.” (quoting Samuel H. Moss, Inc. v. FTC, 148 F.2d 378, 380 (2d Cir. 1945))). The
1

Commission has instructed its administrative law judges to be “inclusive in making evidentiary
determinations.” City of Anaheim, 54 S.E.C. 452, 454 & n.7 (1999) (“[I]f in doubt, let it in.”
(quoting Multi-Med. Convalescent & Nursing Ctr. v. NLRB, 550 F.2d 974, 978 (4th Cir. 1977))).
Applying this broad standard, there is no reason to exclude this anticipated evidence
before the hearing. If, as the Division argues, evidence of personal hardship or job pressure is
not relevant to Helterbran’s or Cisneros’s liability, that type of evidence may still demonstrate
mitigating circumstances and be relevant to their level of personal culpability and to what, if any,
sanction is appropriate. The Division may object on relevance or other grounds to any specific
evidence offered at the hearing, and I will rule on any such objections as they arise.
B. Motion to Exclude Character Evidence
The Division moved to preclude Helterbran or Cisneros from examining Hall about his
character in the workplace and about a specific instance of alleged bad conduct by Hall. The
Division asserts that evidence of Hall’s character, with the possible exception of his character for
truthfulness if he testifies, is inadmissible. I will defer ruling on this motion because I would like
to hear more from Helterbran and Cisneros about what testimony, if any, they intend to elicit
from Hall and how that testimony relates to their defenses. I will address this motion orally at
the beginning of the hearing.
C. Order
I ORDER that the Division’s motion to exclude impermissible defenses is DENIED and
that ruling on the motion to exclude character evidence is DEFERRED until the hearing.
