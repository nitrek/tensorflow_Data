ORDER INSTITUTING
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
PURSUANT TO SECTION 15(b) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

In the Matter of
CHRISTOPHER J. BORGO,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Christopher J.
Borgo (“Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission’s
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained in
Section III.B.1 below, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:

A.

RESPONDENT
1. During various times from approximately April 1994 through
October 2004, Respondent was a registered representative associated with more
than ten separate broker-dealers registered with the Commission, including
Salomon Grey Financial Corporation (April 2001 through October 2004), a
Texas-based broker-dealer previously registered with the Commission. Between
July 2010 and November 2012, and between March and August 2013,
Respondent offered and sold securities to individual investors while acting as an
unregistered securities broker. Respondent, 42 years old, is a resident of Palm
Beach County, Florida.

B.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION
1. On January 20, 2016, Respondent plead guilty to one count
of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, in violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 1349, before the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida, in United States v. Eratostene, et. al., No. 15-CR20565-KMW.
2. As part of his guilty plea, Respondent stipulated that from
July 2010 through November 2012, he acted as an unregistered sales agent for
Advanced Equity Partners, DDBO Consulting, and DBBG Consulting, Florida
entities that did business in Miami-Dade County, and elsewhere, by participating
in the offer and sale of Thought Development, Inc. (“TDI”) stock, which was a
penny stock. Specifically, Respondent admitted that he solicited more than ten
individuals who invested funds totaling more than $40,000 in TDI stock.
Respondent admitted that he and his co-conspirators made material false
statements and omitted material facts to investors regarding TDI stock, such as:
falsely stating that TDI would “shortly go public;” that investor funds would be
used by TDI to develop technology, capitalize the company, and fund operations
until its pending public offering; and, that no commission or fees would be
charged, or that only 10 percent of investor funds would be used to pay
commissions and fees. Respondent admitted that, in reality, TDI was not
contemplating a public offering and the investor funds were used to pay
Respondent and other co-conspirators substantial commissions.
IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act,
that Respondent be, and hereby is barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment
2

adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized
statistical rating organization; and
Pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, Respondent be, and hereby is, barred
from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter, finder,
consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for
purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting to induce the
purchase or sale of any penny stock.
Any reapplication for association by the Respondent will be subject to the applicable laws
and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned upon a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the following: (a) any
disgorgement ordered against the Respondent, whether or not the Commission has fully or partially
waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to the conduct that served
as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-regulatory organization arbitration award to a
customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order;
and (d) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization, whether or not related to the conduct
that served as the basis for the Commission order.
By the Commission.

Secretary
