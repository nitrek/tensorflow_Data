Introduction
+ This report presents the findings of empirical research on individual
investors’ understanding of target date retirement funds (TDFs) and
advertisements related to those funds
+ This report provides data on individual investors’ use,
comprehension, and perceptions of TDFs, tested via an online panel
survey of 1
1,000
000 investors
+ The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has
sponsored this study. The SEC contracted with Siegel+Gale, a
professional firm with experience in investor surveys,
surveys to conduct
conduct

investor testing for this study

Methodology

5

Online Survey Methodology

+ This study was conducted as an online survey of 1,000
individual investors sourced from a national consumer panel
+ Individuals who currently hold investments in retirement
accounts (employer-sponsored or IRA); total sample size =
1,000
+	 Individuals who are not currently retired
+	 Gender mix (aim for an even split)
+	 Mix of ages (older than 20 years of age
age, up to age 65)
+	 Sample n=300 each for 21–34 and 35–49 age groups,
n=400 for 50–65
+ Solle or joiintt responsibilit
ibility for deciisiion-maki
king on personall
investments
+	 Mix of education levels

6

Online Survey Methodology

+ Mix of TDF owners and non-owners (40–60% of each age
group must own a TDF)
+ Neither the respondent, nor any member of his or her
household, currently works or has worked for any of the
following types of companies or agencies: marketing, market
research, public relations, journalism (web, print, TV), or
financial services industry or financial regulator

Note: Because sample criteria ensured 40–60% TDF owners for each age group, the proportion of TDF owners and non-owners in
each age group may not be nationally representative.

Online Survey Methodology:

Comprehension Questions

+ A series of comprehension questions on TDFs was presented
to respondents
+	 Comprehension was tested by asking factual questions
(with either closed end, i.e., multiple choice or true/false
questions, or open end responses)
+ Respondents were also asked a behavioral question on the
likelihood of investing in a TDF

8

Online Survey Methodology:

Comprehension Questions

+ Respondents were then presented with one of four documents
that differed by whether they included certain disclosures:*
+	 Baseline Document: did not contain disclosure of a TDF’s
asset allocation immediately adjacent to the first use of the
TDF’s name (“tagline disclosure”) and disclosure of a
TDF’s glid
TDF’
lide path
th illustrati
ill t tion sh
howiing the

allocations among the types of investments over the life of
the TDF (“glide path illustration”)
+	 Tagline

and
d no

+	 Glide Path Document: contained the glide path illustration
and

+	 Combined Document: contained both the tagline disclosure
and the glide path illustration

* See Appendix 5 for the four documents tested.

Online Survey Methodology:

Comprehension Questions

+	 After viewing the document, a series of questions on TDFs was
then presented to respondents
+ Comprehension was tested by asking factual questions (with
either closed end, i.e., multiple choice or true/false questions,
or open ended responses)
+	 Resp
pondents were able to view the document simultaneously
y
with the questions
+	 For certain questions, the correct answer could be determined
in some, but not all, documents
+	 Respondents were also asked a follow-up behavioral question
on the likelihood of investing in a TDF
+ Presenting different documents containing different disclosures
was designed to gauge whether these disclosures assisted
respondents in identifying certain information, such as, among
other things, whether they could identify the TDF’s investment
asset allocation at the target date and whether they could identify
whether the investment asset allocation changed after the target
date

10

Online Survey Methodology: Margin of Error 

+	 All percentages derived from the sample in this report are subject to sampling
error. For an estimated percentage p, we can be 95% confident that the value
of P—the actual percentag
ge among
g everyyone in the universe of interest—would
be in the interval p ± 1.96 * sqrt [p * (100 – p) / n], where n is the size of the
sample from which p is derived.
+	 The maximum confidence interval occurs at 50% (p = 50) and gets smaller as p
gets either smaller or larger. The maximum 95% confidence interval for a
a

percentage based on various sample sizes is shown below.

+	 The sampling error increases by a factor of 1.41 when comparing two
percentages from different samples of the same size (vs. reviewing the results
of one sample as a standalone percentage)

Overall, 96% of respondents who own TDFs hold their

TDFs in employer-sponsored plans or IRAs; employer-

sponsored accounts were most common at 75%

target date was greater among those who viewed the two
documents containing the glide path illustration than among
those who viewed the two documents that did not contain the
glide path illustration (see slide 53)
+ Only 36% of respondents correctly indicated a TDF does not provide
guaranteed income in retirement (see slide 28)

15

Key Findings: General (continued)

+ For questions that tested more general knowledge of how target date
retirement funds work, there was some variation among respondents
with different backgrounds
+	 The 50–65 age group tended to be more knowledgeable about
TDFs, but there was not much variation in comprehension
between 21–34 year olds and 35–49	
49 year olds (see slide 31)
+	 Respondents who own TDFs were more knowledgeable than
those who do not own TDFs. Among respondents who own
TDFs the most knowledgeable were individuals who chose their
TDFs,
investments in their employer-sponsored retirement plan
(“employer-sponsored only; not default”); they scored nominally
higher than those who hold TDFs in IRAs or other accounts
(“other TDF”) and those who invested in a TDF by default
(“employer-sponsored only; default”). (see slides 27 and 32)

16

Key Findings by Document

+ Document comprehension results indicate that the correct response
rate by respondents varied depending on the document reviewed and
the question asked.
asked Certain questions could only be answered
correctly by respondents based on the disclosure contained in some
of the four documents reviewed.*
+ Comprehension of the fact that TDFs do not guarantee the original
investment was highest among respondents who reviewed the baseline
document, which did not include the tagline disclosure or the glide path
illustration (see slide 58)
+	 Respondents who reviewed the document containing only the tagline
disclosure were most likely to correctly identify the investment asset
allocation at the target date. Some respondents who reviewed the two
documents containing the tagline incorrectly concluded that the asset
allocation five years after the target date would be the same as the
asset allocation at the target date (see slides 61-62)

* See Appendix 5 for the four documents tested.

17

Key Findings by Document

+	 Respondents who reviewed the documents containing the glide
path illustration and the combined tagline and glide path
illustration correctly answered questions relating to the investment
asset allocation after the target date more frequently than
respondents reviewing the two documents that did not contain the
glide
g
de pat
path (see	
(see sslides
des 53, 5
57,, and
a d6
62))
+	 Respondents who reviewed the documents containing the glide
path illustration and the combined tagline and glide path
illustration correctly answered questions relating to how the
investment asset allocation changes over time more frequently
than respondents reviewing the two documents that did not
contain the glide path (see slides 49-51))

Q6. A target date retirement fund is designed to shift to more conservative

Q7. The mix of stocks and bonds held by a target date retirement fund changes over
time. For example, the same target date retirement fund might hold 60% in stocks
and 40% in bonds today, and 20% in stocks and 80% in bonds at some future time.
Q8. A target date retirement fund provides guaranteed income in retirement.
Q9. The mix of stocks and bonds in a target date retirement fund does not change
after the target date. For example, a target date retirement fund that has 40% in
stocks and 60% in bonds at the target date will thereafter always have 40% in stocks
and 60% in bonds.
Q10. All target date retirement funds that have the same year in their names have

Q6. A target date retirement fund is designed to shift to more conservative
investments over time.
Q7. The mix of stocks and bonds held by a target date retirement fund
changes over time. For example, the same target date retirement fund might
y, and 20% in stocks and 80% in
hold 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds today,
bonds at some future time.
Q8. A target date retirement fund provides guaranteed income in retirement.
Q9. The mix of stocks and bonds in a target date retirement fund does not
change after the target date. For example, a target date retirement fund that
has 40% in stocks and 60% in bonds at the target date will thereafter always
have 40% in stocks and 60% in bonds.
Q10. All target date retirement funds that have the same year in their names
have the same mix of stock and bond investments at the target date. For
example, if one target date 2020 retirement fund holds 40% stocks and 60%
