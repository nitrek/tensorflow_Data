INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT
January 13, 2015

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., Division of Enforcement, Securities and
Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) issued an Order Instituting
Administrative Proceedings (OIP) on December 10, 2014, alleging that Respondents have
securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and have not filed required periodic reports. The OIP required that
Respondents file an Answer to the allegations within ten days after service of the OIP. OIP at 3;
17 C.F.R. 201..220(b). On December 23, 2014, the Division of Enforcement filed the
Declaration of Neil J. Welch, Jr. to Assist Secretary with Record of Service (Welch Declaration).
The Welch Declaration demonstrates that each Respondent, except Broadway International
Development Corp. (Broadway International) was served with the OIP by December 22, 2014.
See C.F.R. 201.141(a)(2)(ii).
In an order issued on December 29, 2014, I found that Broadway International was
served with the OIP on December 22, 2014, postponed the hearing scheduled to begin on
January 5, 2015, and ordered a telephonic prehearing conference on January 9, 2015. The
Billiard Channel, Inc., Admin Proc. Rulings Release No. 2169, 2014 SEC LEXIS 5016. In the
December 29, 2014, Order, I stated that any Respondent that did not file an Answer, appear at
the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding would be found in default. See
C.F.R. 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).

No Respondent appeared at the prehearing conference on January 9, 2015. The Division
of Enforcement represented that the bankruptcy trustee representing Boston Chicken, Inc.
(Boston Chicken), does not oppose revocation of Boston Chicken’s registered securities. As of
the date of this Initial Decision, no Respondent has filed an Answer or otherwise defended the
proceeding. Accordingly, I find The Billiard Channel, Inc. (Billiard Channel), Boston Chicken,
Bridgeport Capital Corp. (Bridgeport Capital), and Broadway International (collectively,
Respondents) to be in default and find the allegations in the OIP to be true as to these
Respondents. See C.F.R. 201.155(a), (b), .220(f), .221(f).
Findings of Fact
Billiard Channel, Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1091495, is a Delaware corporation
located in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). Billiard Channel is delinquent in its
periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form
10 registration statement on September 13, 1999, which reported a net loss of $6,186 from the
company’s September 18, 1998, inception to April 22, 1999.
Boston Chicken, CIK No. 894751, is a Delaware corporation located in Golden,
Colorado, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). Boston Chicken is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having
not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended October 4, 1998,
which reported a net loss of over $725 million for the prior nine months.
Bridgeport Capital, CIK No. 1140770, is a delinquent Colorado corporation located in
Boulder, Colorado, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). Bridgeport Capital is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period
ended September 30, 2002, which reported a net loss of $650 for the prior three months.
Broadway International, CIK No. 1219041, is a permanently revoked Nevada corporation
located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with a class of securities registered with the

Form 10 registration statement on September 23, 2003, which reported a net loss of $277,187
from the company’s July 31, 2001, inception to December 31, 2002.
Conclusions of Law
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rules (Rule or Rules) 13a-1 and 13a-13
require issuers of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section
12 to file with the Commission current and accurate information in annual and quarterly reports,
even if the registration is voluntary under Exchange Act Section 12(g). Specifically, Exchange
Act Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports and Exchange Act Rule 13a-13 requires
domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. Respondents
have failed to do so. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be subject
2

to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No.
55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), mot. for recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Moreover, Respondents have failed
to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with their periodic filing obligations, or, through their failure to maintain a valid
address on file with the Commission, did not receive such letters. See OIP at 2. Respondents’
failure to file timely annual and quarterly reports is a violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a)
and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13.
Sanctions
Exchange Act Section 12(j) authorizes the Commission, “as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a class of securities or
suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for
hearing, that the registrant has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or rules
thereunder. In determining the public interest or what is necessary or appropriate for the
protection of investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the
issuer’s violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability
involved, the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future
compliance, and the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway
Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May
31, 2006).
The failure to file required periodic reports is a serious violation because the reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act are the primary tool that Congress fashioned for the protection
of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of securities.
SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondents’ violations are
recurrent in that each Respondent repeatedly failed to file periodic reports for over a decade. See
Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May
23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period considered
recurrent). Respondents are culpable because they knew, or should have known, of their
obligation to file periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 249.308a, .310 (Commission Forms 10-Q,
10-K); Robert L. Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS
2722, at *40 n.60 (Aug. 5, 2011) (stating that the Commission has “repeatedly held that
ignorance of the securities laws is not a defense to liability thereunder”). By not participating in
this proceeding, Respondents forfeited an opportunity to show they have made efforts to remedy
their past violations and to offer assurances against further violations. On these facts, it is
necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the registration of each class
of Respondents’ registered securities.
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registration of each class of registered securities of The Billiard Channel, Inc., Boston
Chicken, Inc., Bridgeport Capital Corp., and Broadway International Development Corp., is
hereby REVOKED.

This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that
Rule, I FURTHER ORDER that a party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision
within twelve days after service of the Initial Decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(b). A party may
also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the Initial Decision,
pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then that party shall have twenty-one days to file
a petition for review from the date of the order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error
of fact. The Initial Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of
finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review
or motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative
to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall
not become final as to that party.
In addition, a respondent has the right to file a motion to set aside a default within a
reasonable time, stating the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specifying the nature of
the proposed defense. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). The Commission can set aside a default at any time
for good cause. Id.
