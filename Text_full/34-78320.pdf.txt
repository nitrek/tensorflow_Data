Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted by
Cascade Technologies Corp. (“Cascade Technologies” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a)
of the Rules of Practice of the Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement
of these proceedings initiated against Respondent on June 15, 2016, pursuant to Section 12(j) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on
behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or
denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject
matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to Cascade Technologies Corp. (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that 1 :
1.
Cascade Technologies (CIK No. 1324344) is a Wyoming corporation
located in Beverly Hills, California. At all times relevant to this proceeding, the
securities of Cascade Technologies have been registered under Exchange Act Section

operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly “Pink Sheets”) (“OTC Link”), had seven
market makers and were eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule
15c2-11(f)(3).
2.
Cascade Technologies has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section
13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports
with the Commission since the period ended September 30, 2012.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for the
protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(j), registration of each class of Respondent’s
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby is, revoked.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
