INITIAL DECISION
August 16, 2016

Polly Atkinson, Esq., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Randal Hansen, partner, for RAHFCO Management Group, LLC

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision dismisses the follow-on proceeding against RAHFCO Management
Group, LLC, a defunct unregistered investment adviser. RAHFCO was previously enjoined by
default against violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities
laws.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on January 13, 2016, pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(Advisers Act). The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Hansen, No. 1:13-cv1403 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2015), appeal dismissed, No. 16-74 (2d Cir. Mar. 16, 2016), in which
Respondent RAHFCO Management Group, LLC, was enjoined against violations of the
antifraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. In accordance with leave
granted, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion for summary disposition, pursuant to 17
C.F.R. § 201.250(a) on April 28, 2016. In the absence of an opposition from RAHFCO, the

Division timely filed a reply on July 19, 2016.1 Thereafter, filings were received from
RAHFCO, followed by responsive filings from the Division.
This Initial Decision is based on the pleadings and RAHFCO’s Answer to the OIP.2
There is no genuine issue with regard to any fact that is material to this proceeding. All material
facts that concern the activities for which RAHFCO was enjoined were decided in the civil case
on which this proceeding is based and in the criminal case against its principal, Randal Hansen,
himself, United States v. Hansen, No. 13-cr-40053 (D.S.D. June 10, 2014), aff’d, 791 F.3d 863
(8th Cir. 2015), rehearing en banc denied, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 13839 (Aug. 6, 2015), cert.
denied, 136 S. Ct. 698 (2015). Any other facts in Respondent’s pleadings have been taken as
true, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions
that are inconsistent with this decision were considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
The OIP alleges that RAHFCO was enjoined against violations of the antifraud and
registration provisions in SEC v. Hansen. The Division urges that it be barred from the securities
industry. RAHFCO requests that the proceeding be dismissed. Thus, the Division has been on
notice that the proceeding could be decided against it.
C. Procedural Issues
1. Official Notice

1

In light of numerous letters from Randal Hansen, who appeared on behalf of RAHFCO,
regarding the logistical difficulties he experienced as an inmate at Duluth Federal Prison Camp
in reviewing the Division’s investigative file, the due date for the opposition was extended from
June 13 to July 15, 2016. RAHFCO Mgmt. Grp., LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release Nos. 3744,
2016 SEC LEXIS 1232 (A.L.J. Mar. 29, 2016); 3903, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2033 (A.L.J. June 8, 2016).
See Byron S. Rainner, Exchange Act Release No. 59040, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2840, at *4-7 (Dec. 2,
2008) (incarcerated respondent); José P. Zollino, Exchange Act Release No. 51632, 2005 SEC
LEXIS 987, at *7-10 (Apr. 29, 2005) (incarcerated respondent). A respondent must have “a
reasonable amount of time to review the investigative file before being required to file any
pleadings.” Byron S. Rainner, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2840, at *7; José P. Zollino, 2005 SEC LEXIS
987, at *10.

RAHFCO’s Answer, dated January 21, 2016, and mailed on January 22, 2016, from Duluth
FPC, where Hansen is incarcerated, was received on February 9, 2016. A thirteen-page
opposition filing dated July 25, 2016, which was mailed from Duluth FPC and received on
August 1, 2016, advised that the contents were findings but that RAHFCO’s actual “answer”
[opposition] would be forthcoming after the guard who locked it up returned from vacation.
Thereafter, a four-page opposition filing dated August 5, 2016, was received on August 15,
2016.

Official notice pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323 is taken of: the docket report and the
courts’ orders in SEC v. Hansen and United States v. Hansen; the Commission’s public official
records contained in EDGAR concerning Respondent, RAHFCO Funds LP, RAHFCO Growth
Fund LP, and RAHFCO Select LP; and of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(FINRA), records as well. See Joseph S. Amundsen, Exchange Act Release No. 69406, 2013
SEC LEXIS 1148, at *1 n.1 (Apr. 18, 2013), pet. for review denied, 575 F. App’x 1 (D.C. Cir.
2014).
2. Collateral Estoppel
It is well established that the Commission does not permit a respondent to relitigate issues
that were addressed in a previous civil or criminal proceeding. See, e.g., Marshall E. Melton,
Advisers Act Release No. 2151, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *2-10, *22-30 (July 25, 2003) (civil
proceeding); Ira William Scott, Advisers Act Release No. 1752, 1998 SEC LEXIS 1957, at *8-9
(Sept. 15, 1998) (conviction).
The pendency of an appeal does not preclude the Commission from action based on an
injunction or conviction. See Joseph P. Galluzzi, Exchange Act Release No. 46405, 2002 SEC
LEXIS 3423, at *10 n.21 (Aug. 23, 2002); Charles Phillip Elliott, Exchange Act Release No.
31202, 1992 SEC LEXIS 2334, at *11 (Sept. 17, 1992). Were RAHFCO to be successful in
overturning its injunction, it could request the Commission to vacate any sanctions ordered in
this proceeding (or to dismiss the proceeding, if it is still pending).3
3. Selective Prosecution
Respondent suggests that the government’s prosecuting Hansen and not others involved
in RAHFCO constitutes selective prosecution. “Selective prosecution,” however, is a term of
art. “To establish such a claim, a petitioner must demonstrate that he was unfairly singled out for
prosecution based on improper considerations such as race, religion, or the desire to prevent the
exercise of a constitutionally protected right.” Scott Epstein, Exchange Act Release No. 59328,
2009 SEC LEXIS 217, at *53 (Jan. 30, 2009); accord Robert Radano, Advisers Act Release No.

See Jilaine H. Bauer, Esq., Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 9464, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3132
(Oct. 8, 2013) (dismissing follow-on administrative proceeding after court of appeals, while
petition for review was pending before Commission, reversed and remanded district court’s
judgment that was basis for OIP); Richard L. Goble, Exchange Act Release No. 68651, 2013
SEC LEXIS 129 (Jan. 14, 2013) (dismissing follow-on administrative proceeding after court of

No. 68462, 2012 SEC LEXIS 4020 (Dec. 18, 2012) (vacating bar issued in follow-on

2750, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1504, at *34 n.74 (June 30, 2008). No such showing was made here.
Rather, the decisions to seek civil sanctions against RAHFCO and to prosecute Hansen and not
others were exercises of prosecutorial discretion. Robert Radano, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1504, at
*34 n.74. (citing Dolphin and Bradbury, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 54143, 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1592, at *47-48 (July 13, 2006), aff’d, 512 F.3d 634 (D.C. Cir. 2008)). The fact that
individuals other than Hansen may have been involved in RAHFCO’s misconduct does not
relieve RAHFCO from responsibility for acts committed through Hansen (or through others).
See James J. Pasztor, Exchange Act Release No. 42008, 1999 SEC LEXIS 2193, at *15-18, *2529 (Oct. 14, 1999) (supervisor held liable for registered representative’s execution of violative
directed trades; supervisor had tried to stop the trading but was overruled by broker-dealer’s
owner who was friendly with the customer); Charles K. Seavey, Advisers Act Release No. 2119,
2003 SEC LEXIS 716, at *12-14, *19-20 (Mar. 27, 2003) (associated person found liable where
investment adviser required him to sign materially misleading letter), aff’d, 111 F. App’x 911
(9th Cir. 2004).
Respondent also suggests that Hansen received ineffective assistance of counsel in
United States v. Hansen and/or SEC v. Hansen. Any challenge to such issues in either of those
cases should be brought before the court in which the case was heard. See Harold F. Harris,
Exchange Act Release No. 53122 A, 2006 SEC LEXIS 68, at *23 (Jan. 13, 2006).
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
The Commission’s March 1, 2013, complaint in SEC v. Hansen alleged that Hansen and
RAHFCO violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act); Sections 10(b)
and 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and
206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder; the violations were alleged to have
been committed from at least April 2007 through May 2011 in the offer and sale of securities in
two private hedge funds – RAHFCO Funds LP and RAHFCO Growth Fund LP – by Hansen,
RAHFCO and others. SEC v. Hansen, ECF No. 1. Hansen, a non-attorney, attempted to appear
on behalf of RAHFCO, but the court ruled that business entities cannot appear pro se, and that a
default judgment may be entered against RAHFCO unless an attorney appears on its behalf.
SEC v. Hansen, ECF No. 43.
Accordingly, RAHFCO was enjoined, by default, on December 21, 2015, from
committing violations of Securities Act Section 17(a); Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a)
and Rule 10b-5; and Advisers Act Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8; the
court also ordered RAHFCO to pay disgorgement of $1,193,315 plus prejudgment interest of
$166,231.36 and to pay a civil penalty of $1,193,315. SEC v. Hansen, ECF No. 104. Hansen’s
attempt, as a non-attorney, to appeal this judgment failed. The court of appeals dismissed the
appeal on March 16, 2016, ruling that a corporation, even a limited liability corporation, cannot
appear in federal court except through licensed counsel; the court’s mandate issued on May 26,
2016. SEC v. Hansen, No. 16-74 (2d Cir.), ECF Nos. 37, 39. RAHFCO has no funds that would
have enabled it to hire an attorney to represent it in SEC v. Hansen. See, e.g., letter from Hansen
dated January 21, 2016. In fact, the parties agree that RAHFCO is defunct. See March 29, 2016,
prehearing conference Tr. 30-31; Division’s July 19, 2016, Reply at 1 (“its charter . . . has been
cancelled by the state of Delaware for failure to pay taxes”).

A firm can act only through its agents and is accountable for the actions of its responsible
officers, including, in the case of RAHFCO, Hansen. See C.E. Carlson, Inc. v. SEC, 859 F.2d
1429, 1435 (10th Cir. 1988); A.J. White & Co. v. SEC, 556 F.2d 619, 624 (1st Cir. 1977). A
corporation’s scienter may be imputed from that of individuals controlling it. See SEC v.
Blinder, Robinson & Co., 542 F. Supp. 468, 476 n.3 (D. Colo. 1982) (citing SEC v. Manor
Nursing Ctrs., Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1096-97 nn.16-18 (2d Cir. 1972)). As such, facts established
in United States v. Hansen will be considered in this proceeding. See Don Warner Reinhard,
Exchange Act Release No. 63720, 2011 SEC LEXIS 158, at *14-17 (Jan. 14, 2011)
(respondent’s conviction considered in proceeding based on default injunction in evaluating
whether sanctions should be imposed in the public interest in light of the Steadman factors).
Respondent was formed on January 4, 2007. Official notice of the public official records
of the Delaware Secretary of State.4 Respondent was the general or managing partner of
RAHFCO Funds LP and RAHFCO Growth Fund LP,5 and Hansen was Respondent’s managing
member. Official notice.6 Hansen’s primary business is farming; he has been a farmer for fiftytwo years. See letter from Hansen dated January 21, 2016. Neither Respondent nor Hansen was
registered as, or associated with, a registered investment adviser or broker dealer. Official notice
of Commission records and of FINRA records contained in BrokerCheck (showing no
registration or association). Hansen was convicted in 2014 after a jury trial in United States v.
Hansen of mail fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, 1349. United States v. Hansen, ECF No. 77. In finding
Hansen guilty of these crimes, the jury necessarily found that “Hansen voluntarily and
intentionally devised, made up, or participated in a scheme to defraud investors out of money or
property by means of material false representations or promises regarding fraudulent investment
schemes involving RAHFCO Funds Limited Partnership, RAHFCO Growth Fund Limited
Partnership, [and] RAHFCO Management Group LLC.” Id., ECF No. 50 at 7, 10 (jury
instructions concerning counts 2-5 – wire fraud – and counts 6-13 and 17-29 – mail fraud); ECF
No. 54 (verdict of guilty on those counts); ECF No. 77 (conviction on those counts); see CSX
Transp., Inc. v. Hensley, 556 U.S. 838, 841 (2009) (juries are presumed to follow court’s

RAHFCO’s January 3, 2007, certificate of formation as a limited liability company under the
provisions and subject to the requirements of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act was
executed by Hansen as its manager and is attached to the Division’s motion for summary
disposition as Exhibit 3.

PPMs for the two funds are attached to the Division’s motion for summary disposition as
Exhibits 5 and 6, and Respondent refers generally to the PPMs in his opposition dated July 25,
2016. The PPMs indicate that RAHFCO, as general partner, was to receive a management fee,
payable monthly in arrears, amounting to approximately 1.5% of the limited partners’ share of
the funds’ net asset value. See Ex. 5 at SFG 090064; Ex. 6 at RAHFCO 0000308.

instructions). The dates when the offenses charged in each individual count ended ranged from
July 2007 to May 2011. United States v. Hansen, ECF No. 77. Hansen was sentenced to 108
months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay
$17,514,258.89 in restitution to 75 victims. Id., ECF No. 77 at 3, 6-8. Hansen was then barred
from the securities industry in a follow-on proceeding. Randal Kent Hansen, Initial Decision
Release No. 754, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1001 (A.L.J. Mar. 18, 2015), finality order, Exchange Act
Release No. 74844, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1637 (Apr. 29, 2015).
Others, including Vincent Puma and Anthony Johnson, were involved in RAHFCO and
actually defrauded Hansen such that he and his family lost a great deal of money. Opposition
dated July 25, 2016, passim.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
RAHFCO has been enjoined “from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in
connection with . . . the purchase or sale of any security” within the meaning of Section
203(e)(4) of the Advisers Act and Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act.
As found above, Respondent was the general partner of two hedge funds, RAHFCO
Funds LP and RAHFCO Growth Fund LP. Thus, it was an investment adviser. See Goldstein v.
SEC, 451 F.3d 873, 876 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that the general partner of a hedge fund is an
investment adviser within the meaning of the Advisers Act). The Commission has authority to
sanction registered or unregistered investment advisers under Section 203 of the Advisers Act.
Teicher v. SEC, 177 F.3d 1016, 1017-18 (D.C. Cir. 1999).7
IV. SANCTION
The Division requests a collateral bar,8 while RAHFCO asks that the proceeding be
dismissed. For the reasons discussed below, the proceeding will be dismissed.
A. Sanction Considerations
The Commission determines sanctions pursuant to a public interest standard. See 15
U.S.C. § 80b-3(e). The Commission considers factors including:

7

While this proceeding was authorized pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act as well as
Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act, the facts to which conclusive effect must be given that were
established in United States v. Hansen do not support the Division’s argument that Respondent
was an [unregistered] broker. This does not affect the sanctions analysis infra.
8

Such associational bars are authorized by Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, but are not
authorized by Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act. Compare Advisers Act Section 203(e) with
Advisers Act Section 203(f).
6

the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s
assurances against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful
nature of his conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present
opportunities for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)). The Commission also considers the age of the violation and the degree of
harm to investors and the marketplace resulting from the violation. Marshall E. Melton, 2003
SEC LEXIS 1767, at *4-5.
B. Public Interest Analysis
As described in the Findings of Fact, RAHFCO’s conduct, assuming that all of Hansen’s
conduct is attributed to RAHFCO, was egregious and recurrent, over a period of several years,
and involved scienter. The violations are neither recent nor distant in time. Numerous investors
were affected, leading to substantial restitution. Consistent with a vigorous defense of the
charges against it, RAHFCO has not recognized the wrongful nature of its conduct.
Nonetheless, in the circumstances of the instant case, the likelihood of future violations
approaches zero – RAHFCO is defunct, as the parties agree. The injunction on which this
proceeding is based was entered by default because RAHFCO had no funds to pay an attorney.
RAHFCO’s charter has even been cancelled. Hansen himself, after fifty-two years as a farmer,
will be under court supervision for the foreseeable future – 108 months of imprisonment
followed by three years of supervised release. Respondent’s filings cite these considerations in
urging the undersigned to deny the relief sought by the Division and to dismiss the proceeding
with prejudice.9
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that this administrative proceeding IS DISMISSED.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to
that Rule, a party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days
after service of the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact within ten days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party,
then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the
undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial
9

See, e.g., Opposition dated August 5, 2016, at 2: “As the SEC has several times stated . . .
RAHFCO is defunct . . . and Randal Hansen, is presently incarcerated and will be for yet several
years. However, the SEC simply likes harassing and wasting taxpayer money on frivolous
matters and issues [such as] obtaining an injunction against a defunct company.”
7

Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality. The
Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall not become
final as to that party.
