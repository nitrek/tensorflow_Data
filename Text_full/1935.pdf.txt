The Securities and Exchange Commission is charged with the
administration and enforcement of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended."
Under the provisions of the Securities Act, of 1933, as amended,
the main objectives of the Commission's activities are to require a
fair and full disclosure of the material facts regarding securities
offered for sale or sold in interstate commerce or by the use of the
mails and to prevent frauds in the sale of securities. This is accomplished by means of registration statements required to be filed
,J with the Commission in respect to all but exempted securities.
A
prospectus embodying the more important information contained in
such registration statements must be given to prospective purchasers
of a registered security. The Commission is not empowered to express approval of the merits or value of any security, but is limited
to requiring the disclosure of the material facts necessary for the
investor to exercise properly his own judgment. However, the act
specifically provides that it shall be unlawful for any person in the
sale of any securities by the use of any means or instruments of
transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by the
use of the mails, directly or indirectly(1) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or
(2) To obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(3) To engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the
purchaser.
The act further provides that it shall be unlawful for any person,
by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by the use of the mails, to
publish, give publicity to, or circulate any notice, circular, advertisement, newspaper, article, letter, investment service, or communication which, though not purporting to offer a security for sale,
describes such security for a consideration received or to be received,
directly or indirectly, from an issuer, underwriter, or dealer, without
fully disclosing the receipt, whether 'past or prospective, of such
consideration and the amount thereof.
-

Under. the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
primary functions of the Commission may be briefly classified as

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECURITmS AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

TRANSFER OF ADMINISTRATION OF SECURITIES ACT

The Securities Act of 1933 was administered by the Federal Trade
Commission from May 27, 1933, the date of enactment, until September 1, 1934. On this latter date, under the provisions of section
210 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the administration and
enforcement of the Securities Act was transferred to the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
AMENDMENT OF SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED

The Motor Carrier Act of 1935 (approved Aug. 9, 1935), section
214, amended section 3 (a) (6) of the Securities Act of 1933 to read
as follows:
(6) Any security issued by a common or contract carrier, the issuance of
which is subject to the provisions of section 20a of the Interstate Commerce
Act, as amended; [the new law added is in italics].

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The Commission desires to express its appreciation to the Federal
Trade Commission for the cooperation and assistance rendered to:it during the first months of its existence.

PART II
ADVISORY ASSISTANCE

Legislation of the character of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 comprehends within its scope such
a variety of complex situations that innumerable questions necessarily arise during the early period of its administration as to the
applicability of the text of the law to situations which are not the
subject of specific provision but to which it is clear its mandates
were intended to apply. The Commission found it necessary to
arrive at determinations as to the applicability of the legislation to
concrete problems presented and as to the manner of compliance
therewith.
The many problems presented in connection with the
rendering of such assistance covered every aspect of the acts.
Since the scope of the Securities Act of 1933 extends to various
unique types of security interests, situations frequently arose, under
the act, where the nature of the interest which was offered for sale
was such as to make it difficult to determine whether a security was
involved within the meaning of the act and, if so, who, under the
act, was the issuer of such security. In this connection, problems
most frequently arose in the case of interests in oil, gas, and other
mineral rights, certificates issued under deposit or trust agreements,
and securities issued in reorganizations.
The Securities Act exempts from its registration requirements not
only various types of securities because of their generic character,
but also other securities which are issued in certain specific types of
transactions.
The exemptive provisions of the latter type have presented questions of particular difficulty, the solutions of which have
required a thorough-going understanding of the history of the particular provisions in question, and of the practical results of the
application of such provisions. The act also exempts from registration, securities offered in limited amounts where such offerings meet
requirements to be imposed by the Commission. Pursuant to the
authority conferred by this provision of the act, various requirements were formulated to be satisfied as conditions to the availability
-of such exemption to-offerings of such securities.
Numerous problems also arose under those provisions of the act
exempting certain types of transactions, such as private offerings
and dealers' and brokers' transactions, from the requirement of prior
.registration.
Other questions on which advice was frequently
9

10

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECURITmS AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sought related to the requirements of the act and of the Commission's regulations in regard to prospectuses and the filing and amendment of registration statements.
The administration of the Securities Exchange Act also brought to
the Commission many questions of a novel and difficult character.
Advice was given to the public on the subjects of national securities
exchanges, temporary registration, and subsequent permanent registration of securities on national securities exchanges. The provisions
of section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, relating to the
reporting of transactions by directors, officers, and principal stockholders of issuers of listed securities, were such as to give rise to
numerous inquiries relating to the nature of beneficial ownership
within the meaning of this section. After careful study of the problems involved in this question, opinions were published which, it is
believed, have been of substantial assistance to the public.
In view of the volume and diversity of inquiries received, it was
essential to provide for the coordination of this part of the work
so as to effect uniformity in the opinions which were rendered. The
letters and memoranda of conferences which contained opinions rendered were classified and indexed. In addition, a summary of interpretations of the Securities Act rendered by the Federal Trade
Commission and by the Securities and Exchange Commission was
prepared for the use of the Commission, in such form as to make
practicable its .periodic revision. The preparation of a similar summary was commenced of interpretations rendered of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and regulations promulgated thereunder .
.As a result of the method described above, consistency was obtained in the interpretation of the acts arid rules and regulations.
While for the most part advisory opinions rendered; in answer t-b
inquiries received, were not published, a number or' these opmiofts
were publicly released in cases where the questions involved had been
the subject of wide-spread- interest and numerous inquiries.
The advisory assistance rendered by the Commission was of manifest importance to the public because of the newness of the acts and
regulations and the resulting lack of precedence by which persons
seeking to comply with the law in. particular situations might be
guided. Moreover, it is believed that the spirit of cooperation engendered between the public and the Commission through this interpretative service was of definite value. In addition, the: Oommission benefited greatly from the information obtained through the
correspondence and conferences incidental to the rendering of such
service. From these sources much valuable information: was 'obtained
on the basis of which existing regulations were improved and new
regulations promulgated.

REGISTRATION OF EXCHANGES AS NATIONAL SECURITIES
EXCHANGES

Pursuant to section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
24 exchanges submitted applications for registration as national
securities exchanges.
In considering these applications, the constitution, bylaws, and
rules and regulations of each exchange were examined and analyzed.
Each exchange was required to execute an agreement to comply with
the provisions of the act and any rules and regulations thereunder.
and to enforce compliance with such provisions by its members, so
far as is within its power. Each exchange was also required to
include in its rules provision for the expulsion, suspension, or disciplining of members for conduct or, proceeding inconsistent with
just and equitable principles of trade, and to declare that willful
violation of any provision of such act or any rule or regulation
thereunder shall be considered conduct or proceeding inconsistent
with just and equitable principles of trade.
Upon investigation into the affairs of the New York Mining Exchange and the New York Produce Exchange, both of which applied
for registration, the New York Mining Exchange discontinued operations entirely, and the New York Produce Exchange ceased to
afford facilities for trading in securities.
. A merger of the Los Angeles Curb Exchange with the Los Angeles
Stock Exchange necessitated an examination into the terms and
conditions of such merger, and the determination whether the merged
exchange was so organized as to be able to comply with the act and
the rules and regulations thereunder, and whether its rules were just
and adequate to insure fair dealing, and to protect investors. Upon
the completion of this examination, such determination was made
and the merged exchange was permitted to continue in operation
as a national securities exchange;
The cessation of trading in securities by the 2 New York exchanges
above named and the merger of the Los Angeles exchanges, reduced
to. 21 the number of securities exchanges registered with' the
tJoinDiission.
From time to time during the year, such registered exchanges
filed amendments to their registration statements. These amendments covered changes in membership, in exchange trading rules,
in securities admitted to listed or unlisted trading privileges, and
in the: rules for the government of exchanges.' Such amendments.
were subjected to thorough analysis to ascertain whether the exchanges were being maintained in compliance with the provisions.

OF EXCHANGES FROM REGISTRATION
SECURITIES EXCHANGES

AS NATIONAL

Pursuant to section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 19
exchanges filed applications for exemption from registration as national securities exchanges. The applicants were granted temporary
exemption from registration pending investigations with respect to
their constitution, bylaws, trading rules and practices, members,
volume of security transactions, and the financial standing of companies having securities traded 'on these, exchanges. Investigators
were sent to the far West to examine 7 exchanges, to the ':Middle
West to examine 4 exchanges, to the South to examine 3 exchanges,
and to New England to examine 2 exchanges.
The reports filed by the trial examiners before whom hearings
were held on the applications for exemption, were analyzed preliminary to determining which applications should, in the public
interest, be granted.
After investigation of the California Stock Exchange, the Boston
Curb Exchange, and the Hartford Stock Exchange, operations on
those exchanges were altogether discontinued.
The Philippine Stock Exchange ~f Manila discontinued Rpe~atiQns
as of March 1, 193'5,'and thereupon its temporary exempticn was
canceled by the Commission.
The cancelation of this application, together with the dissolution
of the three exchanges above mentioned, reduced the number of exchanges grunted temporary exemption as of June 30, 1935, to 15.
The Standard Stock Exchange of Spokane, which had previously
been granted temporary exemption from registration, submitted an
application for registration as a national securities exchange.
The Chicago Curb Exchange, which also had been granted temporary exemption from registration, asked leave to withdraw ..i~
application for exemption and to substitute therefor an application
for registration as a national securities exchange.

After a thorough examination of these two exchanges, it was determined that such exchanges were so organized as to be able to
.comply with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
.and the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, "the Commission granted the Standard Stock Exchange of Spokane registration as a national securities exchange, effective October 1, 1935, and
.extended its temporary exemption from registration to that date,
and granted the Chicago Curb Exchange registration, effective November 1, 1935, and extended its temporary exemption from registration to that date.
During the year a new exchange was organized in Manila under
fhe designation of Associated Stock Exchange (Manila, P. I.).
The Acting Governor General of the Philippine Islands was requested to furnish information concerning such exchange, and on
May 16,1935, the exchange applied for exemption from registration.
Upon request, the Governor General authorized the insular auditor
in Manila to make an investigation of the exchange, in accordance
'with a questionnaire setting forth the scope of such investigation prepared by the Commission. Subsequently, this exchange dissolved.

FORMULATION OF RULES FOR THE REGULATION OF TRADING
ON EXCHANGES

A comprehensive survey was made of the activities of specialists,
floor traders, and odd-lot dealers on the New York Stock Exchange
and on the New York Curb Exchange, as well as an analysis of
trading on other exchanges. On the basis of this study, suggested
rules for the regulation of trading on exchanges were formulated.
"These rules were sent to all national securities exchanges, with the
Commission's request or recommendation that they be adopted. As
.of the close of the year, 16 exchanges had adopted such rules, either
.as recommended or in modified form. It is not considered that these
.suggested rules shall represent the final regulations to be promulgated regarding this matter. They are experimental in character
.and may be changed if further study indicates a necessity therefor.

14

ANNUAL

REPORT OF THE-8ECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Various phases of trading. on exchanges were covered by these
rilles, including limitations on a member's trading while on or off
the floor of an exchange; participation by members in joint accounts; reports of substantial joint accounts; handling of customers'
discretionary accounts and discretionary orders; the use of puts,
calls, and straddles by members; members acting in the dual capacity of brokers and dealers; the preservation of records or orders
by members; successive transactions by members; registration of specialists and odd-lot dealers; limitation upon the dealings of specialists and odd-lot dealers; and short selling.
To assist in the detection of violations of these trading rules, to
study the effect of such rules on market activities and operations, and
to assist the Commission in the formulation of further rules in connection with these subjects and correlated matters, various detailed
report forms were devised to be filed by exchanges and members of
exchanges. These reports disclosed, among other things, the extent of trading by members and partners for their own account as
compared with the total volume of transactions on exchanges, and
the effect of trading by specialists on quotations and the market
action of the securities in which they specialize.
Approximately 380 such report-s are filed each week and a system
has been devised for the expeditious analysis in order to detect manipulative practices or trading by members and to determine whether
further rules are necessary to make exchanges free, open, and orderly
market places for securities.
These reports are also useful in accumulating material in connection with a study of the feasibility and advisability of the complete
segregation or limitation of the functions of the dealer and broker,
the results of which will be reported to the Congress pursuant to the
mandate of section 11 (e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
DETECTION OF EXCESSIVE TRADING AND MANIPULATIVE AND
DECEPTIVE PRACTICES ON EXCHANGES

Pursuant to sections 9 and 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, trading activities on the major exchanges were under surveillance, and all transactions which appeared to be manipulative
in character were promptly referred to the regional offices for investigation. The tape quotations of the New York Stock Exchange
and the New York Curb Exchange were under continuous observation, and complete lists of daily transactions were required to be
furnished by all exchanges.
Transactions ~
 the various exchanges were constantly scrutinized
to detect trading in securities by members, which trading might be
excessive in view of the financial resources of such members or in

view of the market for such securities. Trading activities were also
observed for the purpose of detecting trading by specialists in the
securities in which they specialize, which was not reasonably necessary to permit such specialists to maintain a fair and orderly market
in their securities, and for the purpose of uncovering violations of
the other recommended rules for the trading on the exchanges above
mentioned.
.
In connection with the detection of manipulative practices, such
as wash sales, matched orders, pool operations, the "tipping"
of
pool operations, the dissemination of false or misleading information concerning securities, and other manipulative and deceptive
devices, investigations into transactions in 67 securities were made
during the year.
.
A system was devised for the accumulation of important information published or circulated concerning securities and their price
movements. As it was important that such information be immediately available to aid in investigations and for other purposes,
files were established on 838 individual companies, the securities of
which were listed on registered or exempted exchanges, or traded
in over-the-counter markets. There were also established 116 files on
various industries.
As an aid in uncovering manipulative operations by corporate
"insiders ", examinations were made of the reports of officers, directors, and beneficial owners of registered securities filed under
section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Up to the close
-of the year, analyses were made of transactions of such officers,
directors, and beneficial owners, in 61 securities. Ten field investigations were made as a result of such analyses.
:FORMULATION OF RULES FOR THE REGULATION OF PEGGING, FIXING, OR STABILIZING OPERATIONS BOTH ON EXCHANGES AND IN
THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS

Pursuant to sections 9 (a) (6)., 10 (b) and 15 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, a careful survey was inaugurated by the
-Commission to determine the extent to which pegging, fixing, or
-stabilizing the prices of securities should, in the public interest, be
permitted. Data concerning various types of pegging, fixing, or
stabilizing operations employed in the past were compiled and analyzed as a preliminary to drafting rules and regulations on this
subject.
Statistics were assembled on the average price range of stabilizing
-operations and a comprehensive report was prepared describing the
.advantages and disadvantages and the uses and abuses of such
.operations.

COMMISSION

During the last week of June invitations were sent to representative banks, investment bankers, underwriters, stock exchange members and stock exchanges, as well as the Investment Bankers Association of America, Investment Bankers Code Committee, New York
Securities Dealers Association, and Associated Stock Exchanges,
informing them of conferences to be held with regard to pegging,
fixing, or stabilizing operations. As an aid in facilitating discussions at these conferences, agenda of matters to be considered were
prepared.
FORMULATION OF RULES FOR THE REGULATION OF PUTS, CALLS,
STRADDLES, AND OTHER OPTIONS

Under authority of section 9 (b) and (c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a study was made of traqsactions involving
puts, calls, straddles, and other options. Conferences were held with
put and call brokers, commission houses, and others interested in such
options, to determine the extent to which such transactions should be
permitted. The proposed program encompasses trading practices in
connection with such options, the registration of put and call brokers
and dealers, reports in connection with the granting or acquiring of
options, the duration of options and the endorsement of options by
exchange members.
FORMULATION OF RULES FOR THE REGULATION OF SHORT
SELLING AND STOP-LOSS ORDERS

A detailed analysis of the subject of short selling was made for
the purpose of determining the extent to which such selling is
economically justified and the extent to which it should be curbed.
A rule was formulated which all exchanges were requested to adopt
and which, it is anticipated, will preserve those features of short
selling which are in the public- interest.
The subject of stop-loss orders was also studied with a view todetermining the extent to which the preservation of such orders
is in the public interest. No rules have yet been formulated on this
subject.
COOPERATION WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN THE
SUPERVISION OF ITS MARGIN REGULATIONS

The Commission cooperated closely with the Federal Reserve
Board in the formulation of ite:;rules under section 7 of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 governing the extension and maintenance
of credit on registered securities. Many suggestions were made to
the Federal Reserve Board for its consideration in the drafting of
regulation T.

ANNUAL

For the purpose of supplementing the work of the Federal Reserve
Board, a unit was organized to check up on margin accounts to
ascertain whether they were being maintained in compliance with
regulation T, and also to study the effect of such regulation on the
extension of credits on registered securities. During the year since
the effective date of such regulation, 197 firms were examined. The
results of these examinations were made available to the Federal
Reserve Board for the purpose of indicating the practicability and
effectiveness of regulation T, as well as to reveal violations thereof.
FORMULATION OF RULES RELATING TO BORROWINGS AND SOL.
VENCY OF, AND HYPOTHECATION OF CUSTOMERS' SECURITIES BY,
EXCHANGE MEMBERS, BROKERS, AND DEALERS

Considerable research was done preparatory to the formulation of
rules under section 8 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
defining brokers' aggregate indebtedness and net capital, and determining the proper ratio between the two. This work entailed a study
of brokerage accounting, consideration of an appropriate form of
report of financial condition to be filed periodically by brokers, either
with the exchange or the Commission, and involved several conferences with experts on accounting matters.
Study was also devoted to the matter of hypothecation of customers' securities and safeguards to be erected in connection with
such hypothecation. The subject. included ~'earmarking" of customers' securities, escrowing of customers' surplus funds, commingling of customers' securities, and the extent to which customers'
securities may be hypothecated by brokers. No rules have yet been
promulgated on the subject.
SUPERVISION AND STUDY OF MA'ITERS RELATING TO UNLISTED'
TRADING PRIVILEGES IN SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

During the year 2,808 applications for continuance or extension
of unlisted trading privileges in securities were submitted to the
Commission pursuant to section 12 (f) of the act. Each application
was examined for the purpose of determining whether the subject
security was eligible for unlisted trading privileges on the applicant
exchange. Before any application could be granted, it was necessary
to determine that the subject security either had been admitted to
unlisted trading privileges on the applicant exchange prior to March
1, 1934,or had been registered on another national securities exchange
and had been listed thereon on March 1, 1934. Of the applications.
filed with the Commission, 2,776 were granted and 32 were denied.
In the public interest, the Commission announced that it would
consider objecti?llS to unlisted trading privileges in securities on

'registered exchanges. Corporations and others filed about 100 such
-objeetions,
.
_Section 12. (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires
the Commission to make a study of trading in unlisted securities on
-exchanges, and to report the results of its study to Congress on or
before January 3, 1936. As a preliminary to the writing of such
report, statistics were assembled with respect to the number of securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges on-the-various-registered
and temporarily exempted exchanges, and the information published
by issuers of such securities. A thorough study was also made of
the listing requirements of the various exchanges for admission: of
securities to unlisted trading privileges with a view to determining
the recommendations which should be made with respect to the
listing requirements for admission of securities to such trading privileges.
FORMULATION OF RULES RELATING TO THE REGISTRATION OF
UNlSSUED WARRANTS AND UNISSUED SECURITIES FOR "WHEN,
AS, AND IF ISSUED" TRADING ON EXCHANGES

A comprehensive study was inaugurated concerning the registration of unlisted warrants and securities for" when, as, and if issued"
trading, pursuant to section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. This study embraced an analysis of the economic function
of, and the abuses formerly prevalent in, this type of trading, and
the scope of the regulations to be formulated.
The tentative plan outlined included, among other things, the
registration of unissued warrants or securities, restrictions on margin
trading therein, and the availability of information in respect of
such unissued securities.
In 'Order to expedite a continuous exchange market in such' warrants and securities, both on a "when, as, and if issued" and "issued" basis, consideration was given to the formulation of rules
exempting from registration the class of issued warrants which
would be eligible for registration on a "when, as, and if issued "
basis,'
.
REGULATION OF THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS.

Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of ,1934 authorizes the
Commission to take such steps as will insure to investors in the overthe-counter markets, protection comparable to that afforded to, investors in securities traded on exchanges.

and dealers received intensive study. A comprehensive survey was
made of the" blue sky laws" of the various States with special'.
reference to the provisions concerning the licensing or registration of
brokers and dealers. On the basis of the conclusions reached from
this study, and the experience with such" blue sky laws ", rules and
regulations for the registration of such brokers and dealers with the
Commission, were promulgated. Such rules prescribed in detail the
mechanics for registration, the effective date thereof, grounds for
denial or revocation of registration, cancelation of registration by
brokers or dealers, amendments to registration statements, a form
for registration and for amendments thereto, and included a prohibition against misrepresentations by brokers and dealers with
respect to the registration of any broker or dealer and, where a broker
is acting as agent for both the buyer and the seller, a requirement
that such fact be disclosed.
Such registration will become effective on January 1, 1936.
During the time which elapsed between the promulgation of these
rules on May 6 and the end of the fiscal year, 3,488 applications for
registration had been filed with the Commission," These applications
were' examined for deficiencies and inaccuracies in the information
submitted. All available records of public and voluntary law enforcement agencies throughout the country were utilized for the
purpose of ascertaining whether partners, proprietors, directors, or
branch office managers of firms applying for registration had been
convicted of a crime or enjoined from any practice in connection with
the purchase or sale of securities or arising out of the conduct of the
business of brokers or dealers. As a result of the evidence furnished
by these examinations, many hearings .will be requited to determine
whether any applications for registration should be denied.
As a second step in complying with the mandate of the act to
afford protection to investors in the over-the-counter markets, a comprehensive study was initiated with a view to the eventual formulation' of rules with respect to wash sales, fictitious quotations, matched
orders, misleading activities, false rumors, pegging, fixing, or stabilizing the prices of securities, extension of credit on securities, and
other activities in such markets which affect the prices of securities
traded on exchanges,
REGULATION OF MISCELLANEOUS EXCHANGE AND OTHER
PRACTICES

The Commission has received many complaints with respect to'
exchange practices such as commissions charged by brokers, methods of settlement, interest charges, and other matters, These com• .As of Nov. 1. 1935. 5.080 applications had been filed with the Commission.

COMMISSION

plaints have been analyzed for possible use in the formulation of
rules on these subjects.
Several complaints were received with regard to the reporting
of transactions in securities of issuers which were in receivership,
bankruptcy, or in the process of reorganization.
A careful study
was made of this matter for the purpose of drafting a rule requiring such transactions to be clearly designated so that investors will
be-informed. as to the financial status of issuers.
Section 19 (c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorized
the Commission to make a study of the rules of national securities
exchanges with respect to the classification of members, the methods
of election of officers and committees to insure fair representation
of the membership, and the suspension, expulsion, and disciplining
of members of such exchanges. An exhaustive study of these matters was made and a report was prepared and submitted to the
Congress, together with 11 recommendations.
The subject matter
of this report related to the classification of members of exchanges,
the methods of election of officers and committees, the machinery
of discipline, and a summary of recommendations.
These recom,
mendations dealt with representation of commission brokers on the
governing committee, eligibility of office partners for membership
on the governing committee, nomination of the governing committee
by petition rather than by a nominating committee, election of onethird of the governing committee annually, nomination of the
president by petition, eligibility of nonmembers for the office of
president and other executive offices, membership of standing com- ..
mittees, expenses of arbitration, composition of the arbitral tribunal
in cases in which a nonmember is a party, appeals from the business
conduct committee to the governing committee, and handling of
customers' complaints against members.
.
The New York Stock Exchange and the 'New York Curb Ex-change, as well as some other exchanges throughout the country, incorporated these recommendations, in whole or in part, in their constitutions and bylaws.
The report of the Commission to the Congress on the Government
of Securities Exchanges was transmitted on January 25, 1935, and
will be found in Document No. 85, Seventy-fourth Congress, First
session, House of Representatives.

porary registration of securities on national securities exchanges
under section 1~ (e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Applications for temporary registration were filed for 2,910 stock
issues, covering over 2,000,000,000shares of stock, and 1,968 bond issues, involving nearly $29,000,000,000in face value. These temporary
registrations became effective on October 1, 1934.
Securities not temporarily registered on October 1, 1934, and
sought to be registered prior to the adoption of permanent registration forms of the Commission, were provisionally registered. These
provisional registrations expired 90 days after the promulgation of
the forms for permanent registration. Approximately 100 of such
provisional registration statements were filed and examined.
Temporary registration, under the terms of the act, expired on
June 30, 1935. A temporary exemption from permanent registration was granted all issuers until July 16, 1935, as of which date
all listed securities were required to be permanently registered, except in cases of securities of certain types of issuers for which registration forms were-still to be promulgated or had been promulgated
so recently as to make further temporary exemption necessary to
allow time for filing.
l'ERl\lANENT

REGISTR.\TION OF SECUlUTIES OK EXCHANGES

Having provided for temporary registration of listed securities,
the Commission was faced with the problem of promulgating forms
for the filing of applications for permanent registration.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 specifies broadly the nature
and scope of information to be furnished by an issuer in an application for permanent registration.
The problem, in general, was to
adapt these requirements to the circumstances of the various classes
of issuers through the adoption of a form of application for' each
class. Temporary registration was permitted to continue under the
act only until July 1, 1935. It was desirable to allow issuers ample
time before that date to prepare and file applications for permanent
registration. Consequently, the task of preparing these forms was
necessarily conducted under heavy pressure of time.
The Commission gave a great deal of time and thought to the requirements of permanent registration. Numerous conferences were
held with representatives of exchanges, corporate officials, accountants, and others, in the course of which the Commission received
valuable assistance in its efforts to formulate requirements that
would afford protection to the investor through the dissemination of
adequate information, without unduly burdening private industry.
As the first product of these efforts, a form for permanent registratiorr: of securities issued by corporations was -
approved by the

22

ANNUAL

REPORT OF THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Commission on December 20, 1934. Revised rules governing permanent registration were promulgated early in February 1935.
This general form for corporations, known as form 10, was applicable to a large majority of securities listed on the various exchanges,
and formed the groundwork and model for other forms appropriate
to special types of issues. Prior to July 1, 1935, eight additional
forms were published, designed for use by (1) unincorporated issuers; (2) railroads, including those in receivership or bankruptcy;
(3) insurance companies; (4) protective committees; (5) voting
trustees; (6) investment trusts, incorporated; (7) investment trusts,
unincorporated; and (8) foreign governments.s
As stated above, temporary registration of securities on exchanges
expired by the terms of the act on July 1, 1935. -
It then became unlawful to trade in nonexempt securities unless permanent registration had become effective. In order to avoid any confusion on the'
exchanges immediately after July 1, 1935, due to uncertainty as tothe registered or exempt status of any security, it was deemed advisable to allow an interval for the compilation and publication of complete lists of securities registered or exempt on that date. Accordingly, shortly before July 1, under authority conferred by the act,
the Commission adopted a rule granting to all listed but unregistered
securities an exemption from registration requirements during thefirst 15 days of July 1935.
Furthermore, the Commission considered that all issuers should be
allowed at least 90 days in which to secure effective registration of
their securities after publication of the form appropriate for such
securities. To provide this time the Commission granted exemptions for certain types of securities for various periods after July 1,
1935. The basic set of 12 forms was designed to meet the primary'
problem of securing original registration of the several thousand
issues of securities already listed on national securities exchanges
when the act became effective. These forms represented only the
beginning of the Commission's work in formulating the requirements
and methods of registration.
On July 1, 1935, there remained the
problem of filling out this framework with additional forms to meet
certain complex and peculiar situations. To mention a few of these,.
it is contemplated that special forms will be prepared for corporations emerging from bankruptcy or receivership, corporations in-volved in mergers and consolidations, corporations modifying their
existing securities or issuing, in a variety of transactions, additional
securities of a class already registered.
• Tbree additional forms were pUblished during the first part of the fiscal year 1936,
namely, form 19, for American certificates against foreign issues and for tbe underlyingsecurities; form 20, for seeurttlea other tban bonds of foreign private issuers; and form'
21, for bonds of foreign private Issuers,

-ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

23

Requirements must be formulated for annual and other periodic
reports from issuers, designed to keep reasonably current the information already filed with the Commission.
A guide to forms adopted by the Commission will be found in the
appendix.
Having devised and promulgated forms for the registration of
securities on exchanges, the Commission was next faced with the
problem of examining the registration statements and compiling
the report of securities registered or exempt from registration on
exchanges. Due to the voluminous material filed with most of the
statements and the large number of statements filed, and the limited
time available for the examination prior to July 15, the Commission
was compelled in the first instance to confine this examination to a
cursory study of the statements for obvious errors and deficiencies.
A detailed examination and analysis of the statements and all exhibits filed in connection therewith was subsequently undertaken.
Upon completion of the preliminary examination, a study and
compilation was made of the certifications by exchanges indicating
their approval of the registration, following which the lengthy report
of securities registered or exempt-from registration was prepared.
This report contains a list of all securities which have been permanently registered for trading on national securities exchanges as of
July 16,1935, and those securities which are provisionally registered
or reported by the exchanges to be temporarily exempted from
registration pending the time when registration forms promulgated
by the Commission for such securities became applicable.
The Commission intends to publish, at frequent intervals, supplements to keep this list up to date. Copies of the report of securities
registered or exempt from registration on exchanges and the supplements thereto may be secured at the offices of the Commission in
Washington, D. C.
Under the provisions of a rule promulgated by the Commission
relating to objections to the public disclosure of material filed with
the Commission, several hundred requests for confidential treatment of material in connection with applications for permanent
registration of securities on national securities exchanges were received.' This rule provides that if any person filing an application,
report or document with the Commission under any provision of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 wishes to object to the public
disclosure of any such material, he shall file that portion of the
application, report, or document which contains such information
separately from the remainder and plainly mark it "confidential."
'As of Nov. I, 1935, 529 applications

for confidential treatment

had been received.

24

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The rule further provides that there shall also be filed with such
information written objection to its public disclosure stating therein the reasons why public disclosure is not in the public interest
and also stating whether or not a hearing is desired. Until and
unless the Commission determines that the disclosure of such information is in the public interest, it shall not be made available to the
public.
When requested by the applicants, hearings are scheduled and the
applicants afforded opportunity to appear in support of their application." The Commission considers all the facts, including the
reasons stated in the written objections and the informatron aeveloped in the course of hearings, if any,6 and makes its determination
on the merits of each individual case. Orders of the Oomnnssion
are then issued indicating the action taken,"

.-

The Commission has devised and promulgated three forms for
use in submitting these reports of ownership, viz, form 4, for reporting changes in ownership of equity secutities; form 5, for reporting
ownership of an equity security which was registered during the
last calendar month; and form 6, for reporting ownership by persons who have just become officers, directors, or principal stockholders of a company having equity securities registered.
. During the period September 1, 1934, to June 30, 1935, inclusive,
'10,114 original and 2,524 amended reports were filed and examined.
The Commission compiles and publishes a monthly summary of
stock transactions and holdings of officers, directors, and principal
stockholders as reported on these forms 4, 5, and 6. Copies of these
summaries may be procured at the offices of the Commission in

Washington, D. C.
WITHDRAWAL OR STRIKING FROM LISTING AND REGISTRATION OF
SECURITIES ON A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE

Section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides
tlL,at securities registered on national securities exchanges may be
withdrawn or stricken from listing and registration in' accordance
with the rules of the exchange and, upon such terms as the Commission may deem necessary to impose for the protection of investors,
upon application by the issuer or the exchange to the Commission.
Rules and regulations governing applications for the withdrawal
and striking from listing and registration of securities on national
securities exchanges have been promulgated.
During the period
September 1, 1934, to June 30, 1935, 95 such applications were
received and acted upon by the Commission.

ACT OF

SECURITIES ACT FORMS

In order to encourage financing and remove the hesitancy on
the part of reputable companies to undertake new issues under the
Securities Act, immediately upon its creation, the Commission devoted intensive study to the classification and simplification of the
registration forms. Existing forms were revised and new forms
promulgated.
The outstanding accomplishment in this field was the promulgation of form A':"2for the registration of new security issues of seasoned corporations. This form was designed to provide a more
suitable method of protecting the investor but at the same time calculated to eliminate, as far as possible, needless burdens to new

capital financing. The burden to officers and directors of registered
.companies has been materially reduced and at the same time the
-value of the statement from the investor's viewpoint has been
increased.
,
This new form is used for the registration of security issues of
seasoned corporations with a record of operations. It cannot be
used for ventures of a promotional nature.
In addition, new forms have been promulgated for the registration of oil and gas securities, the form for the registration of securities sold or modified in the course of reorganization has been revised,
and a new form has been adopted for the registration of certificates
of deposit.
EXAMINATION

OF SECURITIES ACT REGISTRATION STATEMENTS

The examination of registration statements filed pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is one of the primary functions
of the Commission. These statements are filed by issuers who propose to publicly offer for sale or sell securities, except exempt securities in interstate commerce or through the mails.
, 'Registration statements are filed on: various forms promulgated
by' the Commission, each of which provides for the submission' of
data called for in the act and other information needed in determining whether the investing public is being apprized regarding
material facts relative to the issuer and the issue to be sold.
The examination of these registration statements requires the
services of expert financial examiners, attorneys, accountants, mining
engineers, petroleum engineers, and other persons expert in the fields
relating to the issuance of securities. When such examination discloses deficiencies in registration statements, registrants are so ad'vised by correspondence and in conference, and amendments are
requested or proceedings instituted under section 8 of the act, depending upon the circumstances of the .particular case. Amendments
filed pursuant to the suggestions contained in the deficiency letter,
or otherwise, are examined in a similar manner. Under the pro'visions of the act, a registration statement becomes effective 20 days
after filing, but the filing of an amendment before the effective date
starts a new 20-day period, unless such amendments are filed with
the consent of the Commission. An amendment filed after the
effective date of the registration statement, if such amendment, upon
its face, appears to the' Commission not to be incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, becomes effective on. such date, as the
Commission may determine, having due regard to the public interest
and the protection of investors.

_The examination of ~tion

an investment. The Commission does not pass judgment upon the
soundness of any -security. The basic policy is that of informing
the investor of the facte concerning securities to be offered for sale
in interstate and foreign commerce, and the aim is to place adequate
and true information "before the investor and to prevent the sale
of securities through misrepresentation-perhaps
the only way in
which fraudulent secUritIes can be sold to the public. The Coinmission's further aim is to accomplish this with the least possible
interference to honest business.

DlSCLOSUBES MADE AS A RESULT OF EXAMINA'J.'IONS

ACT

OF SECWU1'

REGISTRATIONS

For the purpose of giving some indication of the nature of disclosures made as a result of examinations, a few typical cases are
briefly summarized below.
A large public utilities system filed a registration statement containing a balance sheet which showed that the company had a capital
surplus of approximately _$in,ooo,ooo and an earned surplus 9f
approximately $12,000,000. Appended to this balance sheet were 8:
great many pages of footnotes relating to the balance sheet, which
disclosed that many improper accounting and financial practices had
been followed. The footnotes were so long and complicated, how-'
ever, and contained so many technical terms, that it would be -vir;
tually impossible for an average investor to understand them. Furthermore, even a, trained investment analyst would have great diffi-'
cul.ty in .adjusting the balance sheet in accordance with the footnotes
in order to obtain a true picture of the company's financial condition.
The.company was required to compute, the effect in dollars and cents,
as far as possible, of the improper accounting and financial practices
and to set up a balance sheet in a form permitting comparison with
the balance sheet as originally filed. The adjusted. balance sheet
indicated that if proper accounting and financial practices had been
followed; the' company's assets would have- been $153',000,000.'less
than those shown in the original balance sheet, and that in plaea
of the eapital surplus of $1-11,000,000 and the earned surplus '0£
$12,000,000, the company would have a eorporate deficit of $30,000,000"
" .A mining company 'seeking to register an' issue of- its. common
stock, .was required to amend its-prospectus to- disclose that it h,,,d
boon selling stock, to the public- for more than 20 years snd' that PIllF

plan under which there had been received from the public $80,0001
of which only $2,400 had been invested in securities. The balance
Mid 'accrued to the sponsor because of -forfeitures for nonpayment
installments.
The ratio of; maintenance tcharges to income of the
trust had been over 2,300 percent. ..The registrant was required to
amend its prospectus to disclose the ~act that its previous experienoe
had been disastrous to investors. 'In the year that-has elapsed since

STATISTICS OF SECURITIES

REGISTERED UNDER

THE

SECURITIES

ACT

When the Securities and Exchange Commission took over the
administration of the Securities Act of 1933, there were 1,093 registration statements on file," Of these, 794 were effective," 49 were
under stop or refusal order, 153 had been withdrawn, and 97 were
under examination or pending the receipt of amendments.
During the period from September 1, 1934, to June 30, 1935, inclusive, 440 additional registration statements were filed. There
were 315 registration statements which became effective during the
period 10 and 1,094 were effective at the end of the period, 15 of
those effective at the beginning either having been withdrawn or
placed 'under stop order,
The number of registrations withdrawn increased by 72 to 225
.011 June 30, 1935. Stop or refusal orders increased during the period
by'42, there being 91 of such orders in effect on June 30, 1935. As
of June 30,1935, there were 123 registration statements in the process
of examination or awaiting amendment .
. During the 10-month 'period ended on June 30, 1935, securities
with estimated gross proceeds of $909,387,000 have heeome effec:ti~y.;.registered.
Of this amount, $805,698,000 represented new

REGISTRA'fION FEES

Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides tliat
every national securities exchange shall pay 'to the Commission
or before March 15 of each calendar year a registration fee for the
privilege of doing business as a national securities exchange during
the preceding calendar year or any part thereof. Such fee shall be
ill an amount equal to one five-hundredths of 1 percentum of the 'aggregate dollar amount of the sales of securities transacted on such national securities exchanges during the preceding calendar year and
subsequent to its registration as a. national securities exchange. .,
Pursuant to the provisions of this section, and as of June. 30,
1935, the Commission had collected $61,659.86 as fees from national
securities exchanges.
Each national securities exchange submits monthly reports to the
Commission indicating the volume and the dollar value of trading
in stocks and in bonds during the preceding month. In addition to
using these report-s as an aid in determining the accuracy of the
fees paid by the exchanges, the figures are compiled for distribution
to the general public in monthly releases and are reprinted in
detail in the appendix. It will be seen that from October 1, 1-934,
to June 30, 1935, the total volume of trading on national securities
exchanges (including some transactions which are not contained in
the usual reports of volume of trading, particularly odd-lot transactions on the New York Stock Exchange) amounts to $10,076,637,186, of which $7,283.039,072represents the value of trading in stocks
and $2,793,343,008that of trading in bonds. The New York Stock
Exchange accounts for 83.7 percent of the value of trading on' all
registered exchanges and the New York Curb Exchange is responsible for another 12.2,percent.
'
Section 6 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933 provides that at,~
time of filing a registration statement the applicant shall pay' to
the Commission a fee of one one-hundredth of 1 percentum of the
maximum aggregate price at which such securities are proposed
'to be offered.ibut in no case shall .the fee be less than $25.
',\.
Pursuant to this section, during the fiscal year ended June 30,'193&.,
:$160,299.25were collected,

COMPLAINTS, INVESTIGATIONS, HEARINGS, AND LITIGATION

Under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exch:inge
Act of 1934 the Commission has broad p'o~ers to enforce the :Mts
'and the- rules and :regulations. thereunder through ihv.~tigati.Qns,
llearings, and injunctions. '
' ... :
During the y~r, fraudulent and, illegal activities v:i()~ati,llg
:'fue
Securities Act
the Securities Exchange Act came to the attention

'or

of the Commission through complaints or inquiries received from

thtt public, State securities commissions, State- and Federal prosecuting officials, and others, from the Commission's surveillance of
trading activities and examination of registration statements, and
.otherwise. Supposed. violations were investigated and during the
yeu approximately 2\300 cases were under investigation. Whenever
necessary, the investigative- powers of the Commission under sections 19 and 20 of the Securities Act and section 21 of the Securities
Exchange Act were involkd bY';1lCommission order for formal investigation and hearing, -fIesignating an officer of the Commission
to conduct the hearings, .th power to take evidence, subpoena witnesses, and compel the production of records. In these hearings.
the Commission was represented by' members of the General Counsel's staff, who prepared the cases and presented the evidence.
If apparent violations of the acts were disclosed, suits for injunction were brought by the Commission in the Federal courts. During
th~ fiscal year the Commission brought 22 suits for injunction and
carried on 3 suits already brought by the Federal Trade Commission. As of June 30, 1935, permanent injunctions had been obtained against 32 defendants, temporary injunctions against 28 defendants, and temporary restraining orders against 19 defendants.
Suits involving 72 defendants were awaiting hearing.
Evidence of willful violations discovered in 30 of the cases investigated by the Commission was transmitted to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution. In certain cases, in the interest of
speedy justice, evidence of criminal violation was referred forth~

for prosecution without bringing suit for injunction.
Among the more important matters investigated or litigated by
the Commission were the following:
On September 24, 1934, the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey granted a permanent injunction against
fraudulent violations of the Securities Act by National Investment
Thanscript, Inc., Clement H. Congdon, and Marshall
ard, doing
business as Marshall Ward & Co. The Commission's bill charged a'
gigantic swindle in stock of Rayon Industries Corporation, effected
through a tipster sheet, a manipulated market, and fraudulent misrepresentations through wholesale long-distance telephone solicitation. The evidence obtained in the Commission's investigation was
referred to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution.
On' January 7, 1935, a permanent injunction was obtained by the
Commission in the United -States District Court for the District of
LOuiSiana. against fraudulent 'Violations 'of the Securities A-ct by'
''1'ucivas &; Co.., and others. The evidence was referred to the Attorney

. On January 15, 1935, the Commission filed a suit for injunction'
against Robert Collier & Co. and others in the United -States:Distrlet
Court for the Southern District- of New York, alleging fraudulent'
activities in violation of the' Securities Act. The United. States:
district court dismissed the Commission's suit on the ground that the:
Commission was not entitled to appear except by the United States
attorney or the Attorney General. On appeal, the United Btates,
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that in preceedings brought under section 20 (b) of the Securities Act the Cammission was entitled to appear by-its own counsel. The case was
remanded to the district court and on June 30, 1935; had been sent
to a referee to take testimony."
_ On February 4, 1935, the Commission filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York a suit against.
J. Edward Jones and others to enjoin alleged fraudulent and illegal
activities in violation of the Securities Act. On 'February 8, 193'5,
the respondents consented to and the court 'granted a temporary iB,.'
junction. On May 4, 1935, Jones filed' a registration statement under.
the Securities Act relating to securities proposed to be issued bY'
Jones. Because of alleged material misstatements and- omissions'
in this registration statement, proceedings. under section 8 of thES
Securities Act were ordered by the Commission. A subpoena was'
issued for the appearance of Jones at a liearing on June 27, 1935.
Jones failed to appear at the hearing, and, through his' counsel'
appearing specially, refused to obey the subpoena. On June 28, 1935;'
Jones filed in the United States Circuit 'Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit a petition purporting' to. be a petition under section
9 of the Securities Act for review of, the proceedings before' the
Commissicn.v

This order.
W811 signed by Federal Judge Murray Hulburt on Oct. 16, 1935.
The amount return~.
to subscribers amounted to about 80 percent of the total subscriptions.
1ll On July 3, 1935. tbe Commission applied to the United States District Court for thel
Southern District of New York for an order. compelling the attendance of Jones lI.8 a

extensive briefs, the district court granted the order on Aug. 13, 1935. Jones thereupon
appealed to the United States Circuit Conn of A.ppeals for the Second Circuit. -The
argument on this appeal was consolidated with the argument on the Commission's moti~n

SECURITIES VIOLATION RECORDS

The Commission continued negotiations begun by the Federal
Trade Commission with the United States Post Office Department,
State securities commissions, State and Federal prosecuting officials,
and other official and voluntary agencies, with a view to cooperation
in the enforcement of State and Federal laws against the fraudulent
sale of securities. On May 1, 1935, the securities violation records
were established to provide a central index and clearing house for
information relating to securities frauds in the United States and
Canada, both past and current. As a result of data furnished by the
above-mentioned official and unofficial agencies, the records of 15,351
persons against whom State or Federal action had been taken during
the past 10 years in connection with the sale of securities were compiled and indexed. The files so established contain with respect to
each such person the source of the information, and a brief statement
of the violation. Current information is published in a monthly confidential bulletin distributed to official and unofficial agencies engaged
in the prevention and punishment of security frauds.
PROTECTIVE COMMITTEE STUDY
