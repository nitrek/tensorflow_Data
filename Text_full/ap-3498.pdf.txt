ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on December 14, 2015, pursuant to Sections 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The proceeding is a
follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Aletheia Research and Mgmt., Inc., No. 12-cv-10692
(C.D. Cal. May 11, 2015), appeal pending, No. 15-55887 (9th Cir.), in which Respondent Peter J.
Eichler, Jr., was enjoined against violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws.
Eichler was served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i) on
December 18, 2015, and his Answer was due by January 11, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§
201.160(b), .220(b). He failed to file an Answer or otherwise to defend the proceeding. Thus, he
is in default, and the undersigned may determine the proceeding against him. Id.
Accordingly, Eichler IS ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE by January 22, 2016, why he
should not be barred from the securities industry.
