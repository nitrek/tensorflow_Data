DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS

5.
As discussed in more detail above, all of the Respondents are delinquent in their
periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their obligations to file
timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of
Corporation Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through
their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters.
6.
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers
of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current

12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires
domestic issuers to file quarterly reports.

Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
