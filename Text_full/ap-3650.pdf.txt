In the Matter of
GEORGE CHARLES CODY PRICE

ORDER GRANTING
RESPONDENT’S MOTION FOR
LEAVE TO FILE A SURREPLY

On November 5, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
against Respondent George Charles Cody Price. The OIP alleges that on June 26, 2015, a final
judgment was entered by consent against Price, permanently enjoining him from future
violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, in SEC v. ABS Manager,
LLC, No. 13-cv-0319 (S.D. Cal.). Price was served with the OIP on November 16, 2015, and
filed an answer on December 7, 2015. George Charles Cody Price, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3337, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4816 (ALJ Nov. 23, 2015).
At a November 30, 2015, prehearing conference, Price requested a settlement conference
and I granted his request. Tr. 9-12. I also granted leave to the Division of Enforcement to file a
motion for summary disposition (MSD) and set due dates for the motion in the event the
settlement conference did not result in an agreement in principle. George Charles Cody Price,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3366, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4921, at *4 (ALJ Dec. 2, 2015).
Administrative Law Judge Cameron Elliot conducted a settlement conference with the
parties on December 16, 2015. The settlement conference did not result in an offer of settlement.
The Division filed an MSD with the declaration of Lynn M. Dean, including exhibits 1-3, on
December 21, 2015; Price filed in opposition (MSD Opposition) on January 28, 2016, attaching
exhibits and the declaration of Price, with exhibit A, a copy of Price’s declaration filed in the
underlying proceeding in support of his motion for summary judgment; and the Division filed its
reply (MSD Reply), with a supplemental declaration of Dean on February 1, 2016.
The subject of this order is Price’s February 11 motion for leave to file a surreply, to
which the Division filed an opposition on February 12, 2016.
In his motion, Price states that he seeks to record his opposition to the Division’s
supplemental declaration filed with its MSD Reply. Motion at 1. More specifically, he argues
that the assertions in paragraphs three through seven of the supplemental declaration contain

hearsay and new facts, including several factually misleading assertions. Id. at 1-2. Price
categorizes these new facts as follows: (1) “that Price committed additional misdeeds after the
SEC initiated the underlying civil complaint”; (2) “that Price is – to this day – misleading
investors”; and (3) “that Price misled Morgan Stanley about loans extended to ABS Fund, LLC.”
Id. at 2.
The Division opposes Price’s motion, arguing that the Rules of Practice do not provide
for surreplies and that in this instance, a surreply is “neither warranted nor necessary to deciding
the matters raised by the Division’s motion.” Opp. at 1. The Division states that it raised the
issues it did in its MSD Reply in response to mitigating factors raised by Price in his MSD
Opposition. Id. The Division argues that Price’s surreply does not rebut the Division’s
statements in the MSD Reply and is irrelevant to the disposition of the MSD. Id. Additionally,
the Division contends that Price cannot deny the allegations in the complaint because he has
explicitly agreed, by consent, not to do so. MSD Reply at 3-4, 8. Finally, the Division maintains
that Price cannot re-litigate the underlying civil proceeding and that Price’s arguments do not
mitigate the factors relevant to sanctions. Id. at 4-8.
Ruling
Paragraphs three through six of Dean’s supplemental declaration relay allegations
surrounding Price’s conduct in, and relating to, the underlying civil proceeding. See Supp. Decl.
at 1-3. Paragraph seven relays a more recent allegation, though it is unclear whether the alleged
conduct occurred before or after the Division filed the MSD. Id. at 3. Because the Division
could have raised most of these facts earlier in support of its public interest analysis in the MSD,
I will allow Price to respond to these allegations in a surreply. While Rule 250 does not provide
for a surreply, it also does not forbid it. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.250.
Pursuant to Rule 111(h), 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h), I GRANT Price’s motion for leave to
file a surreply and ACCEPT the proposed surreply attached as Exhibit A to his motion.
