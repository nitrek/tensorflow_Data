ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On August 10, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is currently scheduled for August 29, 2016.
On August 18, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(ii) by August 15, 2016. Respondents’ answers to the OIP are therefore due by
August 29, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a)-(b), .220(b). If Respondents fail to
timely file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding, they will be deemed in default, the
proceeding will be determined against them, and the registrations of their securities will be
revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
I ORDER that the August 29, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED, and that a telephonic
prehearing conference shall be held on October 11, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, if the proceeding
has not been resolved by then.
