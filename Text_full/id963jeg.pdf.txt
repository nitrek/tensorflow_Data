In the Matter of
INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
February 18, 2016

DC BRANDS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

APPEARANCES:

Danielle R. Voorhees, for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondent DC
Brands International, Inc. The revocation is based on Respondent’s failure to timely file required
periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On January 11, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding under Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with an order instituting administrative proceedings (OIP). The
OIP alleges that DC Brands has securities registered with the Commission under Exchange Act
Section 12(g) and has repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission, in
violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. DC Brands was
served with the OIP on January 14, 2016, and its answer was due on January 27, 2016. DC Brands
Int’l, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3548, 2016 SEC LEXIS 300 (ALJ Jan. 28, 2016). On
January 28, 2016, I noted that DC Brands had not filed an answer and ordered it to show cause by
February 8, 2016, why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its
failure to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding. Id.
On February 9, 2016, I held a telephonic prehearing conference in this matter. Counsel for
the Division and Kevin Bobryck, who said he was a “representative”1 for DC Brands, appeared.
During the conference, I granted Bobryck’s request to extend the time for DC Brands to file an
answer. On February 10, 2016, I ordered the DC Brands to file an answer and respond to the show
cause order by February 17, 2016. DC Brands Int’l, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3593,

Bobryck explained that he was hired by DC Brands as a consultant, but was not retained by
and could not represent it at the prehearing conference.

2016 SEC LEXIS 494. To date, DC Brands has not filed an answer or responded to the show cause
order.
FINDINGS OF FACT
DC Brands is in default for failing to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding. See
OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice
155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
DC Brands International, Inc., Central Index Key No. 0001393463, is a Colorado
corporation, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission under Exchange Act Section 12(g). Its common stock, ticker symbol “HRDN,” is
quoted on OTC Link, operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. According to the Colorado Secretary
of State, its corporate status is delinquent. DC Brands is now over a year delinquent in its required
periodic filings, having not filed any annual reports since it filed a Form 10-K on April 15, 2014,
and having not filed any quarterly reports since it filed a Form 10-Q on August 19, 2014.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to file
annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied,
Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required
to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v.
McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978). DC Brands failed to file timely periodic reports. As a result, it failed to comply with
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTIONS
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend for a
period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the
issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or rules
thereunder. In determining what sanctions will ensure that investors will be adequately protected,
the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the
isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the
issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of its
assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
The failure of DC Brands to file required periodic reports is serious because the failure
constitutes a violation of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so
that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, 2006 SEC LEXIS
1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned for the
protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of
2

securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). DC Brands’ violations
are also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods.,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009) (respondent
failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year period); Impax Labs., Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008) (respondent’s
failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period considered recurrent). DC Brands is
also culpable because it knew, or should have known, of its obligation to file periodic reports. See
17 C.F.R. §§ 249.308a, .310 (Commission Forms 10-Q, 10-K); China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation
may be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations).
Finally, DC Brands has not answered the OIP or responded to the show cause order to address
whether it has made any efforts to remedy its past violations. DC Brands has also made no
assurances against further violations.
For the reasons described above, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registration of each class of DC Brands’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, under Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registration of each class of registered securities of DC Brands International, Inc., is hereby
REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Under that rule, a party may file a petition for review of this
initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party may also file a
motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule
111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a
party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s
order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become final
as to that party
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at any
time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as
may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a
reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the
proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
