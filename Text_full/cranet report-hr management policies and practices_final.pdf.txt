ABOUT THIS REPORT
About CRANET
The Cranfield Network on International Human Resource Management (CRANET) was launched in
1989 to collect information regarding human resource management (HRM) practices and policies
worldwide. Today, more than 40 academic partners across the globe collaborate to collect this data,
making it the largest on-going HRM study in the world. The project’s aim is to gain insight into best
practices in the HRM field, to compare patterns of HRM policies and practices across countries, and
to explore how HRM changes over time. Findings provide updated information about HRM
practices for practitioners and academics, as well as policy makers and international institutions,
for use with research or policy change. For more information about CRANET, you can visit

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2014/15 CRANET/SHRM/CIHRS data are a clear reflection of how organizations across the U.S.
are recovering from the recent global financial crisis. The research results show that many firms are

financial crisis.
Where possible, this report compares the 2014/15 findings with those from 2009 and 2004,
revealing emerging trends over the last decade. Some of the findings and trends are summarized
below:

The HR function is increasing its strategic role. Relying predominantly on recruiting the head of
HR internally from the organization’s HR department, HR leaders are more often part of the
Board or equivalent top executive team. Human resource management (HRM) strategies are also
being formalized in writing. Clear distinctions are emerging between the HR function and line
management in the responsibilities for HRM policy decisions, combined with high reliance on
technology-based systems. [Pages 6-8]
Organizations are increasing the size of their workforce and are also reporting higher levels of
employee turnover than in recent years. Where downsizing has been necessary, it has been
achieved primarily through recruitment freezes, wage freezes and voluntary attrition. The
recruitment that does take place is predominantly through in-house activities, such as internal
hires and postings on company websites, with emphasis on attracting minority groups. The use
of commercial job websites is also increasing. In contrast, other selection methods, including
application forms, references and one-on-one interviews, among others, are being used less
frequently than in the past, according to research findings. The use of part-time work is
decreasing, while teleworking and shift-work are on the rise. [Pages 9-14]
Appraisal processes frequently require the input of employees themselves, often leading to
recommendations for future training and career development needs, as well as pay decisions.
Organizations are becoming smarter with providing training, as the average number of training
days is increasing, likely due to greater use of e-learning systems and on-the-job training. [Pages
15-16]
Perhaps related to stock market volatility, the use of incentives based on stock options and profit
sharing as a part of management compensation has decreased. Similarly, the practice of offering
employee benefits that exceed statutory requirements has been declining slightly, except for
health care insurance (likely related to recent changes in legislation). [Page 17]
The concentration of trade union members and the percentage of organizations recognizing trade
unions have increased slightly. Nevertheless, perceptions of trade union influence in
organizations remain low. Downward communication is most commonly taking place through
electronic means, whereas upward communication is done through supervisors. Both upward
and downward communication rely little on collective representation. [Pages 18-20]

1. Introduction
Organizations that participated in the 2014/15 survey, which was administered from October 2014
to May 2015, included a similar percentage of private-sector firms as previous administrations of the
survey (42%), with similar median organization size (750 employees). The predominant employee
type remains clerical/manual. More information on the demographics of responding organizations
can be found in section 7, “Study Methodology.”
The 2014/15 CRANET/SHRM/CIHRS data can be seen as an indicator of how U.S. organizations have
been recovering from the global financial crisis. Private-sector organizations are continuing to report
positive results; 82% of responding firms indicate

were 83% and 71% respectively.
Organizations remain optimistic, believing that markets are growing (66% in 2014/15, which is
comparable to 61% in 2004, but an increase compared to 45% in 2009 at the height of the recession).
This optimism is reflected in how organizations see themselves in comparison to their competitors:
in 2014/15, organizations consistently report that they believe they are outperforming their
competitors through either better-than-average or superior quality (86%), productivity (74%),
environmental matters (64%), stock market performance (64%), profitability (63%) and innovation
(62%).
Against this setting, the following sections detail current findings and trends across HRM policies and
practices, including the role of the HR department through recruitment, selection, training,
compensation and employee communication. Please note that the percentages presented in the
figures may not total 100% due to rounding.

2. HRM Activity in the Organization
HR Department
In 2014/15, 97% of responding organizations report having an HR department; in 2009, this number
was 94%. Median HR-staff-to-employee ratios have fluctuated slightly in each year of data collection,
from 1:89 in 2004 to 1:127 in 2009 to 1:83 in 2014/15. These numbers appear to indicate a
relaxation of the intensity of HR department work compared to the recession figures of 2009.
On average, women constitute around two-thirds of HR department members, but this proportion is
declining (2014/15: 61%; 2009: 63%; 2004: 72%). 2014/15 saw a large increase in the number of
organizations recruiting the head of HR from within their HR department, rising from around onequarter to one-third of organizations (2004: 22%; 2009: 24%; 2014/15: 36%). In contrast,
prevalence of recruiting the head of HR from an HR department in another organization has declined
(2004: 52%; 2009: 52%; 2014/15: 41%).
In 2014/15, two-thirds of responding organizations (66%) report having a written HRM strategy,

HR departments remain involved in the development of business strategy either from the outset or
through consultation, although their involvement has declined slightly (ranging from 80% in 2004 to
78% in 2009 to 76% in 2014/15). There was a decrease in the percentage of HR departments NOT
consulted when the organization was going through a merger, relocation or acquisition between
2004 and 2009 (8% in 2004, 4% in 2009); however, in 2014/15 the percentage returned to 9%, a
level similar to that reported in 2004. More positively, more than one half of HR departments report
that they are consulted from the outset in such situations, which has remained stable since 2004 at
54-61% (depending on the type of organizational change), an indication that HR continues to be
involved in processes vital to the success of organizations.
The HR department appears to be moving away from working jointly with line management in terms
of where the responsibility lies for major policy decisions across a whole range of HRM activities such
as pay and benefits, recruitment and selection (see Figure 2.2), training and development, industrial
relations and workforce expansion/reduction. In most cases, there has been an increase in either the

8

HR department taking sole responsibility for these activities or line management taking
responsibility (but at a much lower absolute level), with a concurrent reduction in the number of
cases where both parties collaborated on the activity led either by HR or by line management. On
average, line management is most active in the area of training and development, and least active in
establishing pay and benefits policies.
This trend implies that HR and line management roles may be becoming institutionalized, with each
party focusing on its own responsibilities. The increasing regulatory environment may be playing a
part here, with firms needing clear guidelines around responsibilities to ensure compliance with
regulations and standards.

Technology and Outsourcing
The findings regarding clear delineation of responsibilities may also be related to the dominance of
technology-based systems that allow more discrete allocation of roles. In 2014/15, the vast majority
of organizations report using human resource information systems (HRIS) or electronic HRM
systems (83%), with 50% of responding organizations using a manager self-service option and 67%
using an employee self-service option.

managers/employees (86%).

Downsizing
In 2014/15, organizations are more likely to have been increasing their headcount in recent years
(46%) than decreasing it (31%), similar to the results from 2004 (41% increasing, 35% decreasing)
and 2009 (51% increasing, 39% decreasing) (see Figure 3.1).

The percentage of operating costs accounted for by labor costs has
seen a slight decline, with an average (i.e., mean) of 53% in 2004,
55% in 2009 and 51% in 2014/15. At the same time, annual staff
turnover (calculated as the percentage of the total workforce that
left the organization in the past year) rose quite substantially from a mean of 16% in 2004 and 12%
in 2009, when job markets were less buoyant, to 19% in 2014/15 (see Figure 3.2).

The dominant downsizing methods across the different employee grades were recruitment freeze,
wage freeze and voluntary redundancies/attrition, all of which were reported by more than onethird of organizations (see Figure 3.3). Internal transfers (35%) and a ban on overtime (39%) for
clerical/manual employees were also common.

Social media is being used by 39-46% of responding organizations, while newspaper advertisements
are being used by 27-38%. The relatively high use of websites compared with “traditional”
newspaper advertisements is notable and to be expected with technological developments.

Interestingly, most selection methods examined are
being used less frequently for managerial hires in
2014/15 compared with 2009 (see Figure 3.5).
However, based on data collected only in 2014/15,
organizations are using new methods such as social

Diversity and Inclusion Programs
According to 2014/15 data (see Figure 3.6), organizations are implementing diversity and inclusion
initiatives primarily at the recruitment stage, with racial/ethnic minorities, people with disabilities
and women being the most frequently targeted groups in these efforts. This could be an indication of
the importance organizations place on increasing diversity of their workforce. The low percentage of
organizations using programs to assist women returning to the workforce and help low-skilled labor
find their way (back) into the workforce is noteworthy.

also shows a significant increase in use (see Figure 3.9): in 2004 and 2009, 10% of responding

represented among 2014/15 responding organizations.)

Employee Appraisal
In 2014/15, most organizations report having a formal appraisal system for all categories of
employees (management: 96%; professional: 95%; clerical/manual: 93%). These performance
appraisal systems rely on the employee’s immediate superior as the most frequent source of data
(75-93% of responding organizations, depending on employee grade), followed by selfappraisal/evaluation as the second most widely used source of input (59%-74%), and then the
supervisor’s superior (41-67% of responding organizations, again increasing by grade) (see Figure
4.1). Subordinate and peer inputs are less likely to be included in the appraisal system across all
categories of workers (up to 23% of responding organizations reporting these practices, depending
on employee grade).

Appraisal data are predominantly used for decisions regarding pay (76%), career moves (75%),
training and development (74%), and workforce planning (59%). A common perception is that
appraisals are predominantly used for pay purposes; although pay is a significant outcome of the
performance appraisal process, the findings show that

are designed to capture their opinions.

and 7.8 respectively; for professionals 6.2, 6.7 and 7.8 respectively)
(see Figure 4.2). The low amount spent on training juxtaposed against the increasing number of
training days may be explained by technology: the initial investments into developing e-learning
systems (which are increasingly being used for training) may have already previously been made, so
the actual cost to deliver more training requires less investment today.

The most popular practices for career management in 2014/15 are on-the-job training, project team
work, informal coaching and computer-based packages (see Figure 4.3), indicating that low-cost inhouse methods appear to be important. The least common practices used are development centers
and international work assignments—both high-cost options. However, it is noteworthy that job
rotation, formal networking and high potential programs are relatively rarely used despite their inhouse nature.

5. Compensation and Benefits
The use of stock options and profit-sharing incentives for management has decreased considerably
from 2009 to 2014/15, whereas the use of employee share/stock programs for management has
increased (see Figure 5.1). This may be due to a combination of regulation of such incentives and the
volatility of the stock market since the global financial crisis.

In 2014/15, the majority of organizations are offering employees a wide range of benefits in excess
of statutory regulation. However, most employee benefits show a small decrease in use of each
benefit compared with what organizations were offering in 2009 (see Figure 5.2). The exception to
this is health care programs (which might be explained by the recent legislative changes regarding
the provision of health insurance). In 2014/15, 65% of responding organizations report offering
health care programs beyond mandatory requirements (compared with 37% in 2009), 62% offer
maternity leave, 56% offer paternity leave, 50% offer

collective bargaining. This number declined from 2004
(52%) to 2009 (33%), but now far exceeds the 2004 level
at 64% in 2014/15. This fluctuation may at least partially be due to an increased proportion of health
care organizations (which are more likely to be unionized environments) included in the latest data
collection round (5% in 2004; 3% in 2009; 8% in 2014/15). The increase in collective bargaining
recognition may also be related to the geographic location of the sample; bargaining rights are very
dependent on state-level law.

These trends are, however, inconsistent with the reported perceived level of influence of trade
unions by organizations in 2014/15; the most common perception is that trade unions have no
influence at all (40%), 13% of respondents indicate trade unions influence their organization to a
very great extent, and 47% report their influence falls somewhere in between “not at all” and “to a
very great extent.” This may either be due to no union being present, or because of strong
management rights clauses in union agreements that still provide management with considerable
leeway in their actions.

Communication Methods
Organizations report a continued decrease in the presence of consultative committees or works
councils, dipping from 33% in 2004 to 23% in 2009 and 22% in 2014/15. As for communication
about organizational issues, the data indicate a

As for the most common methods for downward communication of major issues to employees in
2014/15, organizations predominantly point to electronic communication (69%) and
communication directly with employees (59%) or through immediate superiors (53%) as being used
“to a very great extent” (see Figure 6.3).

7. Study Methodology
This report draws on the results of the CRANET survey conducted in the USA in 2004, 2009 and
2014/15. In each round, more than 200 questionnaires were received from public and private-sector
organizations, with almost 700 questionnaires received in 2014/15. The data are collected through
a standardized questionnaire that is sent to senior-level managers responsible for HRM at the
organization level. In 2014/15, 43% of respondents were the most senior HR representative in their
organization and 93% were based in an HR department. The overall response rate for 2014/15 was
8% (comparable to previous years).
The 2014/15 data collection consisted of three sources. For each data source, the same participation
criteria applied: respondents must be senior-level HR practitioners based in the U.S. and in an
organization with 200 employees or more. Only one response per organization site was requested.
For all three data collections, to increase response rates, participants were given the incentive of
receiving a detailed interim benchmarking report on HRM practices following the data collection and
analysis. Invitations also included an Executive Summary of the 2009 CRANET Survey findings to give
a brief overview of past survey results and to establish interest in the study.
The first source of data was from the Center for International Human Resource Studies (CIHRS),
which administered the survey from October to November 2014. A mailing list of 4,987 HR
professionals was purchased from a commercial provider, Leadership Directories. Pre-notification
letters were mailed on October 10 and introductory e-mails sent on October 14. E-mails with links to
the CRANET Survey were sent on October 21, with a closing date of November 16, which was later
extended to November 21. Approximately 2,000 telephone calls were conducted from October 28 to
November 21 to encourage participation. The actual survey was left open until January 1, 2015;
however, no further reminders were sent to participants. This data collection resulted in 279
responses (6%).
The second source of data was from the alumni of the School of Labor and Employment Relations at
the Pennsylvania State University currently working in HR-related fields. E-mails with the survey link
were sent to 299 alumni on December 4, 2014, with a closing date of December 19, which was later
extended to December 24. Follow-up phone calls were conducted on December 9 and 10 to
encourage participation. The actual survey was left open until January 1, 2015; however, no further
reminders were sent to participants. This data collection resulted in 47 responses (16%).
The third source of data was collected in partnership with the Society for Human Resource
Management (SHRM), which contacted a random sample of 4,000 of its HR professional members
who are managers and above at organizations with 200 or more employees. First round e-mails with
links to the CRANET/SHRM Survey were sent on April 8, with a closing date of April 22, which was
later extended to May 19. Twenty-five $10 Starbucks gift cards were offered as an additional
incentive to participants. Invitation e-mails included an Executive Summary of the 2009 CRANET
Survey findings to give a brief overview of past survey results and to establish interest in the study.
Reminder e-mails were sent to respondents on a regular basis to encourage participation. New
invitation e-mails inviting participants to complete limited sections of the survey were sent on May

25

5, with a closing date of May 19. In total, 428 respondents started the survey, from which 367 valid
responses were used in the data analysis (9% response rate).
Including all three data sources, a total of 693 valid responses were received and used in the analysis.

Sample Demographics
Over the three rounds of data collection, a slight decrease was observed in the percentage of privatesector organizations participating in 2009 compared with 2004, stabilizing between 2009 and
2014/15 (53% in 2004, 39% in 2009, 42% in 2014/15). Dominant industries in all three years
include public administration and education. The health care sector is noticeably more present in the
2014/15 sample (5% in 2004; 3% in 2009; 8% in 2014/15). Ninety per cent of responding
organizations in 2014/15 are headquartered in the U.S., which is consistent with 2009 and 2004 data.
The largest group (33-37%) of organizations in all three years focuses on a worldwide market for its
products or services, with a further 26-29% focusing on the U.S. domestic market. From 2004 to
2014/15, a larger percentage of organizations have experienced mergers (increasing from 6% to
11%) or relocations (increasing from 4% to 8%) in the last three years.
The age of the organizations participating has been gradually declining; in 2004, the mean age was
114 years, decreasing to 78 years in 2009 and 72 years in 2014/15. The median size of participating
organizations has also seen a slight gradual decline, with 975 employees in 2004, 888 employees in
2009 and 750 employees in 2014/15. The majority of employees from responding organizations
were in clerical/manual roles in 2014/15 (mean of 43%), which is consistent with previous rounds
of data collection (47% in 2004; 37% in 2009). In 2014/15, 24% of responding firms reported that
more than 75% of their workforce has a university-level education, and 23% reported that more than
half of their employees are 50 years old or older, while 8% reported that more than half of their
employees are 25 years old or younger.
