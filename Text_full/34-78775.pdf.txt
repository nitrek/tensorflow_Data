AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
AARON NASH KAZINEC,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Section 203(f) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Aaron Nash Kazinec (“Respondent” or
“Kazinec”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

1.
From March 2007 through November 2012, Respondent was a registered
representative associated with a broker-dealer and investment adviser dually registered with the
Commission. Respondent, age 56, is currently incarcerated in Miami, Florida.

B.

ENTRY OF RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

2.
On July 15, 2014, Kazinec pled guilty to one count of wire fraud in violation of
Title 18 United States Code, Section 1343 before the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida, in United States v. Aaron Nash Kazinec, Crim. No. 14-60126-CR-Hurley. On
November 17, 2014, a judgment in the criminal case was entered against Kazinec. He was
sentenced to a prison term of 55 months followed by three years of supervised release, and on
January 5, 2015, the judgment was amended to order Kazinec to make restitution in the amount of
$1,391,250.00.
3.

In connection with that plea, Kazinec admitted that:
(a) From approximately March 2009 through December 2012, he implemented a
scheme by which he informed certain customers that he could reinvest their
annuities and other investments in certain purported alternative investments,
and by doing so, obtain a higher rate of return;
(b) He gave the customers specific instructions on how to make their assets
available for reinvestment. This included making elective cash withdrawals
from their annuities, wiring the proceeds to their checking accounts, and
providing blank checks (or those written payable to “cash”) to Kazinec;
(c) In addition, he convinced one investor to liquidate certain investments and
provide him with a check made payable to “cash,” which Kazinec promised
would be applied toward a universal life insurance policy; and
(d) Instead of investing the funds, he deposited the checks into his personal account
and used most of the funds in connection with gambling activities at various
casinos.
III.

In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission
deems it necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be
instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act;
C.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act; and
D.
Whether, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, it is appropriate and in
the public interest to bar Respondent from participating in any offering of penny stock,
including: acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in
2

activities with a broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny
stock; or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.
IV.

contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly

§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
