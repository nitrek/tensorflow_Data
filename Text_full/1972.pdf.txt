INTRODUCTION


By William J. Casey, Chairman
Securities and Exchange Commis
sion
CHANGE IN THE SECURITIES
MARKETS
As the June 30. 1971 fiscal year
came to an end. there were many prob
lems clamoring for attention in the
structure and operation both of the se
curities markets and of the institutions
on which these markets depend.
In assigning priorities to these prob
lems. the Commission focused its atten

tion first on the economic soundness of
the firms making up the securities in
dustry. their financial responsibility and
the safety of Investors' cash and secun
ties left in their custody. During the
previous years. the failure of substantial
firms had brought about Congressional
enactment of the Secunties Investor
Protection Act potentially committing a
billion dollars of public funds to guar
anteeing the safety of cash and securi
ties left with brokerage firms by public
customers. There was a widespread rec
ognition that brokerage firms needed
xix

"

more adequate, more liquid and more
permanent capital, that their procedures
and accountability had to be tightened
up and that there had to be closer surveillance over their financial and operational soundness. At the same time,
there was a clear need to reshape the
structure of the markets themselves to
modernize the way securities were both
traded and transferred. Thus, going into
.'~ the fiscal year, the Commission sought
to strengthen the industry and' its accountability to, and financial protection
for, its customers while developing a
policy and a framework for modernizing
the structure of the markets. To lay the
basis for the latter, it scheduled hearings at which investors, members of the
industry and all those interested were
asked to present their views on the future structure of the securities markets.
At the same time, there was strong emphasis on developing greater clarity and
certainty in the rules governing the sale
of securities and on making financial information on more companies available
to the public as well as improving the
quality and sensitivity of financial reporting and disclosure. These three concerns-financial responsibility of the industry, the structure of the markets and
better disclosure to investors-were the
foci of major actions taken by the Commission during the 1972 fiscal year.
Additionally, through staff studies, advisory committees or public hearings,
the Commission undertook a thorough
review of its policy, rules and practices
In these areas:
(1)

unsound and unsafe practices in the securities industry,
(2) the future structure of the
markets,
(3) enforcement policy and procedures,
(4) disclosure and

Financial Responsibility and
Accountability
Investor confidence is the cornerstone of public participation in the securities markets. Much was lost in the
broker-dealer failures of 1969 and 1970.
The lessons of that financial crisis in'
the securities industry, the creation and
operation of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and new emphasis
on early detection and prevention of potential firm failures have led to major
new rules to assure financial responsibility and accountability in the securities
industry and justify renewed investor
confidence.
A major undertaking during the 1972
fiscal year was the working out of basic
provisions for a comprehensive rule governing the day-to-day control and protection of customer cash and securities
left with brokerage firms. Congress in
passing the SIPC legislation in late
1970 gave the Commission specific

powers to develop rules to prevent mis
use, improper segregation and loss of
control over customer assets.
It was important that this be effected
without disrupting the flow of certifr
cates to consummate transactions, and
without placing an unnecessary strain
on the banking and brokerage system
by requiring billions of dollars to lie fal
low.
This was substantially accomplished
in a rule proposal circulated in May.
The new Rule (15c3-3) controls use of
customer funds by requiring broker-deal
ers to set up reserve bank accounts to
cover all customer assets not being
used in specified, limited, non-risk areas
of customer service. The size of the re
serve account for each firm is calcu
lated continually through a formula ap
plied to all broker-dealers carrying
public accounts. For customer secunties
left with the firm, broker-dealershave to
show actual possession or control of
such securities in such locations as
banks or certificate depositories. Spe
cific time limits are set for establishing
and verifying control or possession of
these securities and penalties are im
posed for exceedingthem.
The many provisions of this rule ac
complish the major intent of Congress
by isolating customer assets from the
risk of the broker-dealer's business in
such areas as underwriting or firm trad
ing for its own account. They also pro
hibit unwarranted expansion of a firm's
business which had been accomplished
by some broker-dealers through use of
customer funds, a major factor in the
collapse of many broker-dealers in re
cent years, The rule penalizes faulty
record-keepingby increasing the amount
of reserve that must be set aside
against customer assets. Finally, these
provisions are fully consistent with ef
forts by the Commission, the industry,
and others to bring about a total sys
tems approach to the processing of se
curities transactions and the changing

of ownership through improved clear
ance and settlement operations, compu
terized deposrtories and eventual ellrnl
nation of the stock certrficate. The rule,
with minor modifications and amend
ments, went into effect around the turn
of the 1972 calendar year.
The
protection
given
investors
through this rule should be looked at as
only part of a total program covering a
series of interrelated and comprehensive
new requirements. In July, 1971, thel
Commission required Immediate report
ing by broker-dealers of any VIolations
of rules governing net capital or any
non-current status of books or records.
At the same time, any broker-dealer
whose aggregate debt was more than
12 tunes ItS net capital was required to
report in full its operational and finan
cial condition within 15 days after the
end of the month in whrch this ratio oc
curred. In November, 1971, the Com
mission passed a rule mandating quar
terly box counts by broker-dealersof all
securities and certrficatron of secuntles
not in the broker's possession. To in
crease reporting of financial condition
of firms to their customers, the Com
mission last June passed an amend
ment to Rule 17a-5 requiring drstnbu
non of balance sheets on a quarterly
basis to all customers. And to provide
for effectrve screening and regulation of
new firms entering the securities busi
ness, the Commission in the same
month passed amendments to Rules
15c3-1 and 15bl-2, increasing minimum
required net capital for new firms enter
mg the secunnes business and requiring
detailed presentations on the firm's fa
cilities, personnel and financing.
These amendments, like many others,
were an outgrowth of the Commission's
1971 Study of Unsafe .and u'CSOJ!11Ji

1969-70 financial crisis in the securi

try were not limited to rule changes and
new requirements. The Commission has
also established the Office of Chief Examiner to intensify its inspection of
broker-dealers and its oversight over
self-regulatory agencies. In March,
1972, the Commission submitted to
Congressthe draft of a proposed bill to
give to the Commission additional authority over the entire paperwork processing mechanism in securities transactions. Two other bills were subsequently
introduced, both in the House and
Senate. All contemplate that the Commission will set standards for performance, operational compatibility, access
to facilities and standards for safety of
cash and securities. The thrust of this
legislation is to provide coordination
and direction for a nation wide system
for clearance, settlement and ownership
transfer in securities transactions. In
addition, to speed the development of
new systems for securities processing,
the Commission in the 1972 fiscal year
created a special operations group composed of former securities industry operations personnel to work closely with
the industry on stock deposltones,
clearing and settlement systems and
elimination of the stock certificate.

Restructuring of the Markets

C
~,

In addition to knowing that the bro'ker he is dealing with is financially
'sound and operating under close regula:tory supervision, the investor should be
'able to exercise investment judgments
! in markets that are liquid, free from
manipulation, fair to large and small
investors and geared to make the best
price available to investors in all parts
f the country at all times. These factors, plus an emphasis on making available to investors the most professional
service possible, are the continuing
thrust of the Commission's efforts in
the restructuring of the securities markets.
l

~

xxii

Both the nature of the securities markets and the economics of the securities business have undergone rapid
and radical change with increasing
institutionalization of the market. Today,
while individuals still own most of the
stock, institutions do most of the trading. In recent years, the massive flow of
large block trades from institutions has
required new market mechanisms outSide the specialist and the auction market for their absorption. Increased institutional emphasis in brokerage services
has led to new research, positioning
and execution functions unknown until
recently. A commission rate structure
often not reflective of the economic
realities of the business and pressure
from institutions to cut or reallocate
commissions has led to a maze of practices which themselves affected the pattern of securities trading. The overall results, on the one hand, have been the
creation of substantial new market
mechanisms for handling of today's volume and a greater professionalism in
brokerage services, particularly in research. On the other hand, these
changes had brought a fragmentation of
markets, an absence of information on
many trades, a directing of transactions
to some markets on the baSISof commission practices rather than best price,
and a growing gap in the quality of investment research services available to
individuals as compared with institutions.
The concern of the Commission is
that in the future structure of the securities markets competition be made to
work for the investor. Our intent is that
markets become more publicly oriented,
more liquid and that full information on
transactions, quotations and the performance of issuers put the individual
and the institution on an equal footing
in getting information neededfor investment decisions and in obtaining the
best available price.
Accordingly, in October, 1971, the

Commission began two months of hear
ings to get the views of all concerned
with the structure of the markets and
the economics of the securities indus
try: investors and investor groups, stock
exchanges, other self-regulatory agen
cies, Institutions, brokerage firms and
securities industry groups. Out of these
hearings, we developed our Policy State
ment on the Future Structure of the Se
cunties Markets, published In February,

1972.
At the heart of the Commission's
market structure policy is a central mar
ket system for listed securities. The de
velopment of competing markets to
handle the increasing number and com
plexity of securities transactions should
be directed so that these markets are
part of an all-inclusive system with full
disclosure of activrty, comparable regu
lation and standards, and direct compe
tition between market-makers based on
performance. The central market would
not be one market, but in fact a com
munications system tying together all
competing markets so that investors
can see where the best pnce is
available. In this way, trades will flow to
the best market, whether it be in New
York, California, cmcago and whether it
be on the floor of an exchange or in the
office of a market-maker. Only in this
way can competition be put to work for
the investor. Only through centralization
of information can the separate capabil
ities of our markets be combined to
strengthen the overall ability of the ria
tion to mobilize and allocate capital.
To implement the development of the
central market system and other policy
recommendations,
the
Commission
sought to utilize the practical expertise
of those most directly involved. Advisory
committees comprised of experienced
members of the industry and other
qualified experts were named to provide
the Commission with a full range of op
tions and suggestions. One committee,
the Advisory Committee on Market Dis,

closure, has recommended the structure
and governance of a reporting system to
include last sale and volume informa
tion from all markets In a composite
presentation, With trades identified by
market. Thrs Committee now is at work
on recommendations for a system that
will provide the heart of the central
market: a quotations network that would
capture and display current quotations
from all competing market makers so
brokers can direct investor orders to the
best market. Another committee, the
Advisory Committee on a Central Market
System, IS developing recommendations
on regulation and operating standards
for competing markets in the system,
as well as the proper means for provid
ing economic access among such mar
kets. The third group, the Advisory
Committee on Block Trading has sub.
mitted recommendations relating to the
impact of large blocks on secuntres
markets and methods of handling them,
which are now under study by the Com
mission's staff. The staff IS also con
ducting its own analysis of how the cen
tral market system should be designed,
implemented and regulated.
During the fiscal year the Commis
sion developed two rule proposals as a
first step toward a regulatory framework
for the central market system. One Rule,
17a-14, requires registered exchanges
and the National Association of Securi
ties Dealers to make quotations of
listed secunties traded by their mem
bers available on a continuing baSIS;the
second, 17a-15, requires these agencies
to make last sale and volume informa
tion available on a current, real-time
basis. The next step in this process will
be the promulgation of short sale and
other rules necessary to make the
transaction and quotation disclosure
systems not misleading. Once these
communications systems are opera
tional, the course toward the develop
ment of a truly national central market
system will have been set.
xxiri

The central market system is not an
end in itself. It IS a crucial part, but
only a part, of what should be a totally
professional investment service to the
public. The system would inform the
broker of all markets being made in a
security and enable him to achieve the
best possible price for his customer.
But the best execution in the world is
worth little If the investment decision is
based on service that is unprofessional
and Hl-lnformed.The second critical rec
ommendation of the Commission's pol
icy statement sought to improve the
quality of service to all investors by di
rectly addressing the problems of com
mission rates, investment research and
suitability, reciprocal practices in sale of
investment company shares, and institu
tional membership. Together these is
sues present a complex, Interrelated,
often jumbled picture that can be clari
fied only by policies that bring all prac
tices into the open and subject them to
the test of public Interest.
In the case of brokerage commis
sions, a drastic overhaul of the rate
system clearly is called for and IS tak
ing place. In April. 1971, negotiated
rates were introduced into the fixed-rate
system for the first time, covering por
tions of orders over $500,000. In this
fiscal year, the negotiated rate sector
was expandedto portions of orders over
$300,000. Over the full range of the
commission schedule, the Commission
reviewed and allowed implementation of
a new rate schedule by the New York
Stock Exchangewhich eliminated a tem
porary surcharge on smaller trades
while at the same time It provided rate
relief for the industry on these transac
tions. Because the rate structure bears
so closely on the availability of invest
ment services, the policy of the Com
rnissron IS to weigh the pace of expan
sion of competitive rates against its
economic impact on firms.
The Cornrnissron's policy statement
described research as an integral and
XXIV

vital part of any truly professional in
vestment process. In an elaboration of
that statement last May, the Commis
sion said that investment managers
need not necessarily seek the lowest
price for brokerage services in discharg
ing their fiduciary obligations, providing
that the quality of research and other
brokerage services available at a higher
cost can justify that cost difference. Our
concern for the quality of service avail
able to Investors extends also to crea
tion of new services by broker-dealers
and others that will provide individual
ized investment advisory services, prob
ably computerized, to direct investors
With relatively small amounts of money
to invest. The Commission after the
close of the fiscal year appointed an in
dustry advisory committee to review its
rules with a view to encouraging the de
velopment of such services and recom
mending standards for them.
In another area, the Commission has
been concerned about reciprocal prac
tices whereby mutual funds reward
broker-dealersfor the sale of fund shares
by
directing
commission business
through them. Aside from the conflict of
interest this creates for the broker in
recommending fund shares, and the in
vestment manager in seeking best exe
cution, there are very substantial prob
lems of non-disclosure to buyers of the
compensation paid to sell to them and
of improper cost to fundholders who in
effect may pay for the distribution of
shares to others through commission
dollars. The Commission in ItS policy
statement recommended that these
practices be terminated. The NASD at
mid-year published for comment [or
proposed] a rule barring the directing
of brokerage by mutual funds on the
baSISof the sale of fund shares.
Finally, the question of who should
be members of exchanges is closely
tied to any consideration of quality of
service to the investor. The view of the
Commission expressed in its policy

___A-(
statement was that as the central mar
ket system develops it should have at
its heart a core of professional brokers
and market makers serving investors.
The primary purpose of these profes
sionals would be to execute orders for
investors. This means that membership
on exchanges would depend not on the
nature of the brokerage organization but
whether it contributes to the purpose of
the market by serving investors other
than itself. After requesting the advice
and recommendations of exchanges,the
Commission issued for comment a pro
posed rule which would allow exchange
membership for broker-dealers if at
least 80 percent of the value of their
exchange securities transactions repre
sents orders from non-affiliated custom
ers.
As a further part of its efforts to im
plement a policy of maintaining the
fundamentally public character of the
securities markets, the Commission dur
ing the fiscal year sent to Congress a
bill that would empower it to further
regulate trading by existing exchange
members for their own or for affiliated
accounts. In essence, it would require
that all members, when trading for their
own accounts, be required to yield
priority, parity and precedenceto public
customers. This must not be confused
with our belief that all exchange mem
bers must do a predominantly public
business when transacting business on
an exchange; we are merely saying that
exchange members, when they do trade
for their own or for affiliated accounts,
even as market makers, must fully rec
ognize their responsibility to the general
public and be prepared to yield to pub
lic orders.

Disclosure
American securities markets are the
strongest in the world in large measure
because the investor in the American
market is the best informed investor in
the world. Important steps were taken

or started in fiscal 19{2 to strengthen
this
system of
disclosure. These
changes were based on three concepts:
(1) that investor protection and confi
dence could be improved by converting
much of the "boiler plate" and other
meaningless language of the new offer
ing prospectus and other documents
into meaningful disclosure about the is
suer; (2) that greater certainty and clar
ity was needed in rules governing secu
rities transactions, particularly those
involving the securities offering and re
sale process; and (3) that financial re
porting should be made more compara
ble, more comprehensive, and more
meaningful.
Significant new disclosure concepts
grew out of hearings held in 1972 by
the Commission on new issues. These
so-called "hot issue" hearings dealt
with the role of the issuer, underwriter
and market-makers in the handling of
these first-time securities, many of a
highly speculative nature. Commission
proposals issued last July outlined po
tential
requirements for companies
bringing their securities to the public
for the first time to discuss busrness
plans, budget projections, plans for use
of proceeds, and analysis of expected
markets. Equally important, these pro
posals spoke to the problem of mean
ingless prospectus language oriented
more to considerations of liability than
disclosure by requiring specific and di
rect description of this information and
other factors, as well as better organiza
tion and presentation of information to
highlight and clarify the elements of
risk and potential gain.
Commission emphasis on making dis
closure more available, significant and
meaningful also extended to the volume
of information filed by companies whose
securities already are publicly held. This
involved computerization to speed avail
ability of reports on company insider
transactions; introduction of a require
ment that companies specifically report

Policy and Practices

The Commission undertook a sweep
ing review of Its enforcement operations
in fiscal 1972. A special advisory com
mittee on enforcement policies and
practices in June issued a series of rec
ommendations to improve, speed and
clarify enforcement procedures. The
Commission in September outlined, as a
result of the report, a policy to clarify

Staff
In its first major reorganization in 30
years, the Commission restructured its
staff into five operating divisions in
stead of three. The overall effect is to
concentrate resources by focusing all
enforcement and investigative activity in
one division, all disclosure activity in
another and all regulatory activity into a

third area composed of three divisions,
one dealing with markets, another with
money management and the third with
the Commission's public utility holding

ities. This reorganization will enhance
the ability to focus our talent and re

concerning the structure and
efficiency of the markets, the financial

of the broker-dealer community, the
economics, distribution methods and

areas. A major assignment of the divi
sions regulating trading market and
money management activity will be edu

IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS

INVESTOR PROTECTION
A focus of Commission concern and
activity during the 1972 fiscal year was
the development of further safeguards
for investors in light of the securities in
dustry problems revealed by the
1967-1970 operational and financial criSIS. The various steps that were taken
by the Commission, together with the
investor protection legislation previously
enacted by Congress and various meas
ures adopted by the industry itself, were
designed to prevent a recurrence of the
conditions which then prevailed and to
provide a sound basis for renewed
Investor confidence.

Securities Investor Protection
Corporation
The enactment by Congress in De
cember 1970 of the Secunties Investor
Protection Act ranks high among the
measures taken to provide increased
protection to investors. The Act created
a Securities Investor Protection Corpora
tion (SIPC) to insure, up to specified
limits, cash and securities In accounts
of broker-dealer customers. WhIle SIPC

As of June 30, 1972, following

months of operation, SIPC was Involved
in the liquidation of 43 broker-dealers in
17 states. It was estimated that over $7

Study of
Practices

Unsafe

and

Unsound

In the SIPC Act, Congress directed
the Commission to compile a list of un
safe and unsound practices by brokerdealers and to report to the Congress,
within a year, on the corrective steps
being taken under existing law and rec
ommendations
for additional legislation
which might be needed. The Commis
sion's study was submitted to the Con
gress on December 28, 1971.1
In preparing Its report, the Commis
sion drew on information
In ItS own
flies and those of the self-regulatory or
ganizations,
including financial
reports
filed by broker-dealers. The report also
referred to case studies of mdivrdual
firms With financial and operational dif
ficulties, as well as industry surveys and
studies in the operational area by man
agement consultant groups. Among the
areas analyzed in the report were the
1967 paperwork crisrs, the Impact of
the 1969-1970 market decline, the na
ture and use of broker-dealer capital,
management
and operational
deficien
cres, the use of customers' funds and
securities, and stolen securities. The re
port also documented the need for an
early warning system, and Included a
critique on deficiencies in the self-regu
latory scheme.

The report cited the following unsound
practices: (1) Inadequacy and imperman
ence of capital;
in some cases, the
injudicious
employment
of capital that
did exist. (2) Over-emphasis on sales
and trading activitres at the expense of
operational resources. (3) There was an
absence of control of securities traffic
to provide assurance of prompt delivery
of securities
and remittance
of pay
ments. The result was a virtual break
down In the control over the possesSIOn, custody, location and delivery of
securrtres, and In the payment of money
obligations to customers, exposing cus
tomers to risk of loss. The industry, and
to an extent the self-regulatory
bodies
themselves,
had not implemented
or
planned broad-based
solutions to the
settlement process and the related flow
of paper. (4) Inability of self-regulatory
organizations
to respond to the crisrs
With meaningful
corrective
measures.
The absence of an effective early warn
ing system caused belated action when
the full impact of the cnsis was finally
ascertained. (5) Lack of experience of
princrpal members of many, pnncrpally
small, concerns, pointing up problems
in entrance requirements to the indus
try.
The Commission's Study detailed the
corrective
measures already taken or
proposed by the Commission and the
industry, and the areas where the Com
mission deemed further legislation nec
essary. The most significant
of these
measures
(Including
several
adopted

proposed bills are discussed elsewhere
in this annual report. Briefly, capital re

required to disclose details concerning

Measures were taken to provide the
Commission and self-regulatory authonties with more effective early warning
systems. The staffs of the Commission
and the self-regulatory
agencies were
augmented to permit more frequent and
intensive Inspections of broker-dealers.
Units were established within the Commission and the Industry to develop
more efficient clearing and settlement
procedures,
including
the anticipated

of the

Legislation
During the 1972 fiscal year the Commission
submitted
to Congress proposed legislation to amend the Securities Exchange Act to increase and unify
the Commission's
oversight of national
securities exchanges and the NASD and
to make the self-regulatory
pattern of
the Act more effective. Generally, the
provisions of the bill would have given

MARKET STRUCTURE
Policy Statement
DUring the last fiscal year, the Com
mission completed another segment of
a series of hearings and special studies
which began three and a half years ago.
Earlier heanngs had dealt pnmanly with
questions relating to commission rates
and give-up
practices.
The Commis
sion's Institutional
Investor Study Re
port, submitted to Congress on March
10, 1971, developed extensive data
which documented the burgeoning of fin
ancial intermediaries
such as ban ks,
mutual funds, pension funds and insur
ance companies, often referred to sim
ply as "institutions",
and their increas
ing impact on the secunties markets.
The most recent set of hearings, held
between October 12 and December 21,
1971, focused on the structure, opera
tion and regulation
of the sec unties
markets and provided the most compre
hensive collection
of information
on
market structure
since the Commis
sion's Special Study of Secunties Mar
kets in 1961-1963. During these hear
ings, the Commission obtained a broad
spectrum of views. A total of 182 per
sons testified,
covering almost 4,000
pages of transcript,
in addition to 74
persons who supplied
written
state
ments.
Following the heanngs, the Commis
sion released its Statement on the Fu
ture Structure of the Secuntres Markets,
on

problems and deficiencies existmg in
the structure, operation and procedures
of the secunties industry, and presented
In comprehensive form its views con
cerning the appropriate
evolution of the
secuntres markets.
The statement called for creation of a
central market system for listed securt
ties, in order to rnaxrrruze the depth
and liqurdrty of the markets. Essentially,
such a system would be designed to
strengthen cornpetrtion and to make its
operations open and fully cornprehensr
ble to the publrc, The Commission
stated that these objectives could best
be accomplished by: implementation
of
a nationwide disclosure, or market rntor
matron, system; elimination of artificial
Impediments created by exchange rules
or otherwise to dealing in the best
available market; establishment of more
open economic access to all exchanges
by broker-dealers;
and integration

sales of Investment
company shares,
and membership on national secunties

To assist in developing the views it
had articulated in its policy statement,
the Commission designated three com

a central market system, and (3) neces

The Commission took other action to
increase the portion of institutionalsized orders on which commission rates
should be competitively determined,
from ItS prior level of that portion of all
orders over $500,000, to the portion of
orders exceeding $300,000. It also di
rected the National Association of Secu
rities Dealers to formulate and Imple
ment rules to prohibit the practice of
using Investment company portfolio bro
kerage to reward broker-dealers for
sales of Investment company shares.s In
the area of exchange membership, the
Commission requested all registered se
currties exchanges to adopt rules to ex
clude from membership any organiza
tion whose primary function is to route
orders for the purpose of rebating or re
capturing commissions, directly or indi
rectly. It also expressed its intention to
exercise appropriate authority to ensure
that the exchangesadopt rules requiring
that members must conduct a predomi
nant portion of their brokerage commis
sion business with and for nonaffiliated,
public customers.

NASD-member dealers who were not
members of those exchangesa discount
from full commission rates. Until re
cently, however, the New York Stock Ex
change did not provide such a discount.
Thrs policy created competitive disad
vantages for brokers who were not
members of the NYSE.
In October, 1970, the Commission re
quested that the NYSE submit a plan
for "reasonable economic access . . .
for non-member broker-dealers." And, in
September, 1971, the Commission con
ditioned implementation of the Ex
change's new comrnissron
rate schedule
on adoption of a 40 percent discount
for nonmember broker-dealers.s The 40
percent discount became effective on all
exchanges on March 24, 1972. By per
mitting qualified nonmember brokerdealers to retain a portion of the
amount they would otherwise expend in
commission costs, the new rules recog
nize the costs to such broker-dealers of
secunng and transacting securities or
ders. The rules also encourage greater
participation by nonmember brokers and
their customers in exchange securities
markets.

Exchange Membership
Commission Rates
On September 24, 1971, the Commis
sion advised the New York Stock
Exchangethat, with certain stipulations,
it would not object to that Exchange's
implementation of a new minimum com
mission rate schedule proposed by the
Exchange. Upon agreement by the Ex
change, and following clearance by the
Price Commission, this new schedule
became effective on March 24, 1972. A
principal feature of the schedule IS the
incorporation of a volume discount be
ginning at 200 shares.

Nonmember Access. to Exchanges
Since 1960, six regional stock ex
changes have amended rules to give

For many years, the fixed commission
rate structure maintained by the na
tion's exchanges failed to reflect econo
mies of scale associated With the large
orders of institutional customers. This
fact, coupled With the increasing tempo
and magnitude of institutional transac
tions In recent years, combined to pro
duce serious distortions In the existing
market system. Large institutions sough
to avoid what were regarded as exces
sively high commission fees, either by
devising various rebatrve and reciprocal
dealing practices, or by obtaining ex
change membership to avoid the fixed
nonmember commission rate entirely.
The question of the appropriate utiliza
tion of exchange membership took on
added significance In light of the Com

THIRTY-EIGHTH
mission's desire to effectuate a central
market system.
In reviewing recent trends of the mar
kets, the Commission
was concerned
about the continued
confidence
and
participation
of all investors-including
small investors who were found by the
Institutional
Investor Study to be es
sential to the proper functioning
of the
markets. The Commission was further
concerned with the pattern of rnstrtu
tronal trading and the Impact of large
block transactions on the functiomng of
those markets.
The Commission enunciated ItS broad
policy determinations
concerning these
problems In ItS market structure state
ment.
Specifically,
the
Commission
stated its view that the rebating, recap
turmg and redirecting
of commissions
were to be terminated. As noted above,
commission
rates gradually will be ad
justed to a competitive
system which
will more properly reflect the costs of
handling institutional-sized
transactions.
Finally, the Commission stated it would
request that the exchanges admit or re
tain in membership only those individu
als or organizations
which intend to
conduct a predominantly
public bustness with nonaffiliated customers.
On April 20, 1972, the Commission
Issued its WhIte Paper on Institutional
Membership which traced in detail the
origins of the institutional
membership
problem and its relationship to the is
sues of commission
rates and market
structure,
and
further
specified
the
Commission's
position on the steps it
Intended to take to implement ItS poli
cies. On May 5, 1972, the Cornrrussion
submitted legislation to the Congress to
clarify the scope of the Commission's
authority to deal with these questions.

bill would amend Section

all exchange members, either for them

them
regardless
of
whether such trading occurs on or off

On May 26, 1972, the Commission,
pursuant to its existing authority under
Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act, sent
a letter to the presidents of all national
securities
exchanges requesting
adop

During

To assist the Association
in compiling
these indices, the Cornmrsslon
adopted
Rules 13a-17

If the secunties
sold are restncted
securities, Rule 144 requires that they
must have been beneficially owned and
paid for by the seller for a period of at
least two years. The amount of securi
ties which may be sold dunng any 6
month period may not exceed the lesser
of one percent of the class outstanding,
or the average weekly volume of trading
on all exchanges for a 4-week period, If
the secuntres
are traded
on an ex

In sales
by affiliates,
the
amount is computed by aggregating all
restricted and other secunties sold. For
sales by other persons, the amount is
based only on restncted secunties sold.
In certain Situations, sales must be ag

The securities must be sold in "bro

the kind referred to in Rule 145, the
Cornrnission revised Form 5-14. This
form permits the prospectus to be in
the format of a proxy or information
statement.

Proxy Revisions
In December, 1971, the Commission
invited public comments on proposed
amendments to Rules 14a-5 and 14a-8
of its proxy rules, relating to proposals
of security holders for inclusion in an
issuer's proxy rnatenal.tv These amend
ments were adopted In modified form in
September, 1972.20 The provisions of
Rule 14a-8 relating to the grounds on
which management may omit share
holder proposals were amended to sub
stitute objective standards (to the ex
tent feasible) for previously subjective
elements. Other changes include an in
crease from 100 to 200 words In the
maximum length of a secunty holder's
statement In support of a proposal.
In related action, the Commission
amended its rule on avarlabrlity of mate
rials for public Inspection and copying
to extend to materials filed relating to
the proposed omission of a security
holder's proposal from proxy material
and any written staff comments.21

Registration

Statements

The Commission published two re
leases in fiscal year 1972 on procedures
used by the Divrsion of Corporation Fi
nance in processing registratlon
state
ments under the Securities Act. One
release,22noting the increase in work

load and need to curtail time in regis
tration, called attention to procedures
-some old and some new-for review
of registration statements: those whrch
are so poorly prepared or present such
senous problems that the use of further
staff time cannot be justified are de
ferred until the Issuer takes appropriate
corrective action; "Cursory review" or a
somewhat more detailed "summary re
view" is afforded filings (usually repeat
filings) which do not present unusual
disclosure problems and for which few,
if any, comments are necessary; and
"customary review" is given those regis
tration statements deemed to warrant a
complete accounting, financial and legal
review.
The other release23 stated that the
DiVISIonwould ordinanly defer process
ing registration statements filed by is
suers who are delinquent in their pe
riodrc reporting. It pointed out that
failure to observe reporting require
ments is a serious obstacle to the main
tenance of fair and informed trading
markets, precludes the use of certain
registration forms, and deprives the
staff of information necessaryfor review
of registration statements.

Disclosure

by Defense Contractors

In June, 1972, the Commission is
sued a notice to registrants engaged in
defense and other long-term contracts
regarding the need for prompt and ac
curate
disclosure
of
material
information.24 The Commission noted
that because of cornplexrtles and uncer
tainties inherent in such contracts,
costs to be incurred and ultimate profit
are often difficult to estimate. It
stressed that registrants nonetheless
have an obligation to make every effort
to assure that progress on contractssuch as earnings, losses, anticipated
losses or material cost overruns-is
properly reflected in disclosure docu
ments. The Commission's notice was is
sued following release of a staff report

THIRTY-EIGHTH
on disclosure practices of defense con
tractors, including case studies of dis
closure problems.
The staff report concluded that the
Commission's
present rules and disclo
sure forms were generally adequate but
that disclosure by some defense con.
tractors
could be Improved.
It noted
that differences sometimes appear be
tween disclosures In the annual report
filed with the Commission and the an
nual report to stockholders,
which re
ceives wider dissemination.
The Com
mission urged Issuers to make every
effort to assure that disclosures in an
nual reports are as complete and accu
rate as those In filings With the Com

rrussron.

Broker-Dealer Securities
Until recently, the great majority of
registered broker-dealers were privately
financed. During the fiscal year, how
ever, some broker-dealers filed registra
tion statements
to offer equity securi
ties to the investing
public.
Among
these registrants
were several of the
largest firms in the securities industry.
In view of the Commission's
limited
experience
with
publicly-held
brokerdealers, it determined not to propose a
special registration
form or disclosure
guidelines. However, to minimize delays

Form 5-16
As
noted
in
last
year's
annual
report,26 the Commission in December,
1970, adopted Form S-16, a new short
form for the registration
of securities
under the Securrtles Act. The form is
available only to issuers which have an
established record of earnings and con
tinuity of management, and file reports
under the Securities Exchange Act. The

Commission
noted that this was in the nature of an
expenment and subject to revisron.
In June, 1972, amendments to Form
S-16 were adopted.27 Their pnmary pur
pose was to increase the types of trans
actions for which the form may be
used. Before the amendments, the form
could be used only for sales of out
standing secunties "In the regular way"

amendments provide that the form may

1972, the Commission

Because of the pervasive nature of
the pyramid plans and doubts raised by
the structure of certain of the plans as
to whether a security is Involved, Chair
man Casey, in September, 1972, sent a
letter to the Commission's Congres
sional oversight committees to ask their
assistance In obtaining legislation to
protect investors in pyramid plans. He
urged that at a minimum the secuntres
laws be amended to further clanfy the
fact that an investment In a pyramid
promotion IS a secunty, suggesting that
what appears to be needed in this area,
however, is a blend of disclosure and
regulatron-e-drsclosure
alone may not be
enough.

COMMISSION REORGANIZATION
In August, 1972, a major reorganiza
tion of the Commission's structure was
completed, resulting in five operating di
visions instead of three. The Division of
Trading and Markets was divided into a
Divrsron of Enforcement with responsi
bility for all investigative and enforce
ment activities, and a Division of Mar
ket Regulatron
to regulate secunties
markets and broker-dealers, with partic
ular emphasis on the structure and
efficrency of the markets and the finan
cral responsrbrlity
and professional serv
ice of the broker-dealer community. A
new Division of Investment Company
Regulation was spun off from the DiVI
sron of Corporate Regulation, which re
tained responsrbility
for public-utility
holding company and bankruptcy and
reorganization matters. The new Divi
sion, which Will also regulate Investment
advisers, was assigned the task of con
centrating on problems concerning the
economics, dlstnbution methods and
services of investment companies. In
vestment company disclosure activity
was transferred to the Division of Cor
poration Finance, which now has re
sponsibility for all disclosure matters.
The Commission took thrs action in
the belief that the new functional struc

ture will provide a sharper focus on its
prlorrty tasks, more effective use of
available resourc~s, and the develop
ment, through closer supervision and
broader avenues of advancement, of
effective leadership capabilities for the
future.
This separation of disclosure and en
forcement activities from the three regu
latory divisions should encourage posi
tive, forward-looking supervision and
planning in areas of regulatory concern
and a co-ordinated and experienced di
rection of all enforcement and division
activities.

THE DISCLOSURE SYSTEM
A baste purpose of the Federal securities laws IS to provide disclosure of material financial and other information on
companies
seeking
to
raise
capital
through the public offering of their securities, as well as companies whose securrtres
are already publicly held. This
aims at enabling Investors to evaluate
the securities of these companies on an
Informed and realistic basis.
The Secunties Act of 1933 generally
requires that before securities may be
offered to the
public a registration
statement must be filed with the Commission disclosing prescribed categories
of information.
Before the sale of securities can begin, the registration statement must become "effective."
In the

sales, Investors must be furnished
a
prospectus containing the most Signifi
cant
information
In the

statement
The Securrtres Exchange Act of 1934
deals In large part with secunties al
ready outstanding and requires the registratron of securities listed on a na
tional securities exchange, as well as
over-the-counter
secuntres
In
which
there IS a substantial public Interest Issuers of registered secunties must file
annual and other penodic reports designed to provide a public file of current
material information.
The Exchange Act
also requires disclosure of material in
formation to holders of registered secu
ntres In solicitations of proxies for the

ing, or In attempts to acquire control of
a company through a tender offer or
other planned stock acqursrtion. It pro
vides that insiders of companies whose
equity securities are registered must re
port their holdings and transactions
in
all equity securities of their companies.

PUBLIC OFFERING: THE 1933

SECURITIES ACT

The basic concept underlying the Se
curities Act's registration
requirements
IS full disclosure. The Cornrrussron has
no authority to pass on the merits of
the securities to be offered or on the
fairness of the terms of distribution.
If
adequate
and accurate
disclosure
IS
made, it cannot deny registration. The
Act makes It unlawful to represent to
Investors that the Cornrrussion has ap
proved or otherwise passed on the merItS of registered securities.

Registration statements filed With the

review procedures
employed
by the
Divisron are summarized in Part 1 of
the report While most deficrencres are
corrected through an informal letter of
comment procedure, where the Commis
sion finds that material representations
In a registration statement are mislead
rng, inaccurate, or incomplete, It may,
after notice and opportunity for hearing,

suspending
the
effectiveness of the statement.

New Registration Guides
To advise Issuers of the policies gen
erally followed by its staff in the review
of registration
statements
and other
documents, the Commission from time
to time authorizes the publication
of
guides describing the type of informa
tion which mayor
should be included,
and the method of ItS presentation.
DUring the past fiscal year, several
new guides were published. One covers
so-called

prograrns.! These involve the offering of
secunties, usually mutual fund shares,
and the use of such shares as collateral
for a loan, the proceeds of which are
used to pay the premium on a life in
surance policy which IS sold to the cus
tomer at or about the same time. The
Commission has taken the position that
such a program Involves an Investment
contract which IS a security under the
Securrties Act. The gurde sets forth the
staff's positron With respect to disclo
sure, among other things, of risks asso
ciated with a decline in value of the
fund shares which would require the
Investor to furnish additional collateral,
and the nature of tabular Illustrations of

In an effort to make prospectuses

Part 1, it published suggestions for dis

Printing expenses represent one of
the major costs associated with a public
offering of securities. The Commission
indicated ItS rules do not require pro
spectuses to be printed and that less
expensive means of reproduction
may
be used.s

Environment and Civil Rights
In a release Issued in July 1971, the
Commission called attention to the dis

Securities Exchange Act on legal pro

Most
registration

require
one or more amendments

public and the ease with which facts

Registration

on Exchanges

Generally speaking, a security cannot
be traded on a national securities ex

meets the listing requirements
of the
particular exchange, an issuer may reg
ister a class of secunties on the ex
change by frhng with the Commission
and the exchange an application which
discloses pertinent information
concern
ing the issuer and its affairs. DUring
fiscal year 1972, a total of 286 issuers
listed and registered securities on a na

time, and a total of 692 registration ap

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

Periodic Reports
Section 13 of the Securities Exchange
Act requires Issuers of securities regis
tered pursuant to Section 12(b) and
12(g) to file periodic reports, keeping
current the Information contained In the
registration application or statement.
During the fiscal year, the Commission
monitored the results of substantial reVISions made in the prior year In the
annual report form, and through the in
troduction of quarterly financial reports.
Experience to date indicates that these
revisions have served to provide more
adequate and current disclosure of ma
terial information, without imposing
undue burdens on Issuers. In 1972,
45,671 reports-annual,
quarterly and
current-were filed.

Proxy Solicitations
Where proxies are solicited from hold
ers of securities registered under Sec
tion 12 or from security holders of reg
istered public-utility holding companies,
subsidiaries of holding companies, or
registered investment companies, the
Commission's proxy regulation requires
that disclosure be made of all material
facts concerning the matters on which
the security holders are asked to vote,
and that they be afforded an opportu
nity to vote "yes" or "no" on any mat
ter other than the election of directors.
Where management is sohcrtrng proxies,
a security holder desiring to communi
cate With the other security holders may
require management to furnish him with
a list of all security holders or to mail
hrs communication for him. A security
holder may also, subject to certain limi
tations, require the management to in
clude In proxy material any appropriate
proposal which he wants to submit to a
vote of security holders, or he may
make an independent proxy solicitation.
The rules on security holders' proposals
were recently revised, as described In
Part 1.

Copies of proposed proxy material
must be filed with the Commission in
prelimmary form prior to the date of
the proposed solicitation. Where prelimi
nary material fails to meet the pre
scnbed disclosure standards, the man
agement or other group responsible for
its preparation is notified informally and
given an opportunity to correct the defi
crencies In the preparation of the defini
tive proxy material to be furnished to
security holders.
Issuers of securities registered under
Section 12 must transmit an informa
tion statement comparable to proxy rna
tenal to security holders from whom
proxies are not sohcrted with respect to
a stockholders' meeting.
Dunng the 1972 fiscal year, 6,556
proxy statements in definitive form were
filed, 6,534 by management and 22 by
nonmanagement groups or individual
stockholders. In addition, 149 informa
tion statements were filed. The proxy
and mformation statements related to
6,367 companies, and pertained to
6,328 meetings for the election of direc
tors, 350 special rneetmgs not involving
the election of directors, and 27 assets
and authorizations.
ASide from the election of directors,
the votes of security holders were solic
rted with respect to a variety of mat
ters, including mergers, consolidations,
acquisitions and sales of assets and dis
solution of companies (414); authoriza

included in the proxy statements of 193
companies. Typical of such proposals
submrtted to a vote of security holders
were resolutions
on amendments
to
charters or by-laws to provide for cumuIatrve voting for the election of drrec
tors, preemptive
rights, limitations
on
the grant of stock options to and their
exercise by key employees and manage
ment groups, the sending of a postmeeting report to all stockholders, and
limitations
on charitable contributions.
A total of 234 additional
proposals
submitted
by 50 stockholders
were
omitted from the proxy statements of
63 companies In accordance with the
provisions of the rule governing such
proposals. The most common grounds
for omission were that proposals were
not a proper subject for secunty holder
action under pertinent state law; were
not submitted
on time; related to the
ordinary
business
operations
of the
company; or involved a personal gnev
ance against the company.
The figures do not Include 224 pro
posals submitted to 36 companies by a
single individual which were omitted by
the managements
of those companies
because, among other reasons, the pro

Takeover Bids, Large Acquisitions
Sections 13(d) and (e), and 14(d),
(e) and (f) of the Secuntres Exchange
Act, enacted In 1968 and amended in
1970, provide for full disclosure In cash
tender offers and other stock acquisi
tions involving changes In ownership or
control. These provisions were designed
to close gaps In the full disclosure pro
visions of the securities
laws and to
safeguard the interests of persons who
tender their securities in response to a
tender offer.
During the 1972 fiscal year, 1,006
Schedule 13D reports were filed by per
sons or groups which had made acquisi
tions
resulting
In their
ownership
of
more than five percent of a class of se
curities. Fifty such reports were filed by
persons or groups making tender offers,
which,
if successful,
would
result in
more than five percent ownership.
In
addition, 16 Schedule 14D reports were
flied on solrcrtatrons or recommendations
In a tender offer by a person other than
the maker of the offer. Sixteen state
ments were filed for the replacement of
a rnajority of the board of directors oth
erwise than by stockholder
vote. One
statement was filed under a rule on cor,
porate reacquisttions
of securities while
an Issuer is the target of a cash tender
offer.

Insider Reporting
Section 16 of the Securitres Exchange
Act and corresponding
provisions in the

Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and the Investment Company Act
of 1940 are designed to provide other
stockholders
and
investors
generally
With information
on insider securities
transactions
and holdings, and to pre
vent unfair use of confidential
informa
tion by insiders to profit from shortterm trading in a company's securities.
Section 16(a)' of the' Exchange Act
requires every person who beneficially
owns, directly or indirectly,
more than
10 percent of any class of equity secu
rity which IS registered under Section
12, or who IS a director or an officer of
the issuer of any such security, to file
statements
with the Cornrnissron
dis
closing the amount of all equity securi
ties of the issuer of which he is the
beneficial owner and changes in such
ownership.
Copies of such statements
must be filed with exchanges on which
securities are listed. Similar provisions
applicable to insiders of registered pub
hc-utrlrty holding companies and regis
tered close-end
investment
companies
are contained in the Holding Company
Act and Investment Company Act.
Dunng
the
year, the Commission
amended
Rule 16a-6
under the Ex
change Act to provide that the granting,
acquisition,
disposition,
expiration
or
cancellation of any presently exercisable
put, call, option or other right or obliga
tion to buy secunties from, or sell secu
ntres to, another person, whether or not
It is transferable,
shall be deemed a
change In the beneficial ownership
of
the securities to which the right or obli
gation relates.14 At the same time, the
reporting forms (Forms 3 and 4) were
revised to reflect the above amendment
and to require certain additional
infor
matlon.l5
In fiscal 1972, 103,206 ownership re
ports were filed. These included 19,867
initial statements of ownership on Form
3, 79,339
statements
of changes
in
ownership
on
Form
4,
and
4,000
amendments to previously filed reports,
most of which were necessitated by the

THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL
form revisions discussed above.
All ownership reports are made avail
able for public inspection when filed at
the Commission's
office in Washington
and at the exchanges where copies are
filed. In addition, the information
con
tained in reports filed with the Commis
sion is summarized
and published In
the monthly "Official Summary of Secu
rity Transactions and Holdings," which
is distributed by the Government Print
ing Office to about 10,000 subscribers.
To prevent Insiders from making un
fair use of information which they may
have obtained by reason of their rela
tionship with a company, Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act and corresponding
provisions In the Holding Company Act
and the Investment Company Act pro

Short-Swing Trading Litigation
Reliance Electric Co. v, Emerson
Electric CO.I6 A significant decision in
terpreting Section 16(b) was rendered
by the Supreme Court in this case. The
Court held, (4 to 3), that profits real.
ized by a beneficial owner are not re
coverable on the second sale of an is
suer's stock where the first sale had
reduced his holdings to 10 percent or
less. It relied on a proviso in Section
16(b) which excludes from coverage
under that section transactions
by a
shareholder who was not a more-than
10'percent beneficial owner "both at the
time of the purchase and sale . . . of
the security involved." Although recog

The Court declined to adopt the POSI'

the statute. Noting that
words such as "purchase,"

that insiders must not be permitted to

the
dissenters concluded that the statute

Bank similar to that provided for securi
ties of the International Bank for Recon
struction and Development. Acting pur
suant to this authority, the Commission
adopted Regulation lA, which requires
the Bank to file with the Commission
substantially the same type of informa
tion, documents and reports as are re
quired from the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. The
following data reflects information sub
mitted by the Bank to the Commission.
On June 3D, 1972, the outstanding
funded debt of the Ordinary Capital re
sources of the Bank was the equivalent
of $1.1 billion, reflecting a net increase
In the past year of the equivalent of
$107 million. During the year, the
funded debt was increased through pub.
IIc bond issues totaling the equivalent
of $55.6 million as well as pnvate
placements for the equivalent of $68.8
million including, with respect to Japan,
$31.6 million of undrawn commitments
at June 30, 1972, and $5.7 million of
drawings under arrangements entered
Into during the previous year. Addition,
ally, $32.5 million of two-year bonds
were sold in Latin Amenca, essentially
representing a roll-ever of a maturing
borrowmg of $34.3 million. As a result
of the world currency realignment in De.
member 1971, the funded debt in.

creased by $42.5 million due to upward
adjustment of the U.S. dollar equivalent
of borrowings denominated in non-mem
ber currencies, including the equivalent
of $2.6 million relating to borrowings
during the last half of 1971 but pnor to
the December 1971 currency realign
ment. The funded debt was decreased
through the retirement of $23.5 million
from sinking fund purchases and sched
uled debt retirement.
The Asian Development Bank Act,
adopted in March 1966, authorized
United States participation in the ASian
Development Bank and provides an ex.
emption for certain securities which
may be issued or guaranteed by the
Bank, similar to the exemptions ac
corded the lnternatronal Bank for Re
construction and Development and the
Inter-American Development Bank. Act
ing pursuant to this authority, the Com.
mission has adopted Regulation AD
which requires the Bank to file with the
Commission substantially the same type
of information, documents and reports
as are required from those banks. The
Bank has 37 members with subscnp
tions totaling $1 billion. Of the $502.7
million of paid-up shares subscribed,
$494.6 million had matured by June 3D,
1972.
As of June 3D, 1972, eight countries
had contributed or pledged a total of
$174.6 million to the Bank's Special
Funds. In addition to the $14.6 million
set aside from Ordinary Capital in 1969
by the Board of Governors for Special
Funds purposes, another $9.9 million
were set aside In April 1971, making a
total of $24.5 million set aside. In addi
tion, the United States Congress has
authorized a $100 million U.S. contribu
tion to the Bank's Special Funds, and is
consrdenng
the appropriation of these
funds In fiscal 1973. There have been
indications from four other countries of
additional contributions and Japan has
pledgedan additional $40 million.
Through June 30, 1972, the Bank's
borrowings totalled the equivalent of

THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT
$201 million. In 1971, the Bank sold
$20 million U.S. bonds to regional cen
tral banks and borrowed In Switzerland,
the United States, Japan, Belgium
and
Austria. The U.S. borrowing was $50
rrullion, half In 5.year notes at 6% per
cent and half in 25-year bonds at 7%
percent. Before selling securities In the
territory of a country, the Bank must
obtain that country's approval.

TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF
1939
This Act requires that bonds, deben
tures, notes and similar debt secunties
offered for public sale, except as specif
really exempted, be issued under an in
denture which meets the requirements
of the Act and has been duly qualified
with the Commission.
The provisions of the Act are closely
integrated with the requirements of the
Securities Act. Registration pursuant to
the Securities Act of securities to be is
sued under a trust Indenture subject to
the Trust Indenture Act IS not permitted
to become effective unless the inden
ture conforms to the requirements
of
the latter Act designed to safeguard the
rights and Interests of the purchasers.
Moreover, specified
information
about
the trustee and the Indenture must be
included In the registration statement.
The Act was passed after studies by
the Commission had revealed the fre
quency
with
which
trust
indentures
failed to provide minimum
protections
for security holders and absolved socalled trustees from minimum
obliga
tions in the discharge of their trusts. It
requires, among other things, that the
indenture trustee be a corporation With
a minimum combined capital and sur
plus and be free of conflicting Interests
which might interfere With the faithful
exercise of its duties in behalf of the
purchasers of the securities, and it Im
poses high standards of conduct and re
sponsiblllty on the trustee. During fiscal
year 1972, 492 trust indentures relating

39

to securities in the aggregate amount of
$20.2 billion were filed.

INFORMATION FOR PUBLIC

INSPECTION; FREEDOM OF

INFORMATION ACT

The many thousands of registration
statements,
applications,
declarations,
and annual and penodic reports filed
With the Cornrrussron
each year, as well
as many other public documents, are
available for public inspection and copy
ing at the Commission's
public refer
ence room In Its principal offices In
Washington, DC and, in part, at its re
gronal and branch offices.
The categories of materials
available
for public inspection and copying and
those categories of records that are
generally considered to be non public as
permitted under the Freedom of Informa
tion Act are specified in the Commis
sion's rules concerning records and in.
formation (17 CFR 200.80 to 200.82).
The Rule adopted by the Commission to
Implement the provrsions of the Free
dom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552),
became effective July 4, 1967 (17 CFR
200.80). Among other things, that rule
establishes the procedure to be followed
In requesting records or copies, pro
vides a method of administrative appeal
from the denial of access to any record,
and provides for the imposition of fees
when more than one-half man-hour of
work IS performed by members of the
Cornrrussron's
staff to locate and make
available records requested. In addition
to the records described, the Commis
sion also makes available for inspection
and copying all requests for no action
and interpretive
letters received after
December 31, 1970, and responses (17
CFR 20081). After the fiscal year, the
Cornrntssron
further provided (Rule 17
CFR 200.82) that after November 1,
1972,

wise make available related materials
submitted to the Commission by any
person and written comrnunicatrons pre
pared by the staff on these materials.
The Commission has special public
reference facrlltres in the New York, Chi
cago and Los Angeles Regional Offices
and some facilities for public use In
other regional and branch offices. Each
regional office has available for public
examination copies of prospectuses
used in recent offenngs of securities
registered under the Secunties Act; reg
istratron statements and recent annual
reports filed under the secunties Ex
change Act by companies having their
pnncipal office In the region; recent an
nual reports and quarterly reports filed
under the Investment Company Act by
management investment companies hav
rng their principal office In the region;
broker-dealer and investment adviser
applications originating in the region;
letters of notification under Regulation
A filed in the region, and mdeses of
Commission decisions.
During the 1972 fiscal year, 14,683
persons examined matenal on file m
Washmgton; several thousand others ex
amined files in New York, Chicago, and
other regional offices. More than 36,283
searches were made for information reo
quested by indrvrduals, and approxr
mately 4,198 letters were wntten on in
formation requested
The Cornrmssron's records do not
drstmguish between records disclosed
under the federal secunties laws and
those made available under the Free
dom of Information Act. Dunng the
fiscal year, the Commission in 33 Sit
uations, either upon request or on ItS
own motion, considered whether to per.
mit disclosure of records that under its
rule implementing the Freedom of Infor
mation Act (17 CFR 200.80) would gen
erally not have been disclosed.30 In 18
cases disclosure was made; In the reo
rnarrung 13 situations disclosure was

denied. Of the matters considered by
the Commission, 9 involved requests
for access to the contents of investiga
tory files compiled for law-enforcement
purposes. While the Commission gener
ally declined to permit access to investi
gatory files, in 3 cases the request
ing party was provided With a list of the
names and addresses of those persons,
other than confidential informants, who
provided evidence in the course of the
investigation.
The public may make arrangements
through the Public Reference Section at
the Commission's principal offices to
purchase copies of material in the Com
mission's public files. The copies are
produced by a commercial copying com
pany which supplies them to the public

on a subscription or Individual order
basis to persons or firms who have or
can obtain viewing facilities. In micro

The court rejected the applicability of each of the exemptions relied

It held that
the records had not been shown to

proceeding

were held not to be matters that are

because the materials were gathered "for the express

the records were not exempt from disclosure as matters that are specifically

PART 3
REGULATION OF
SECURITIES MARKETS
In addition to the disclosure provisions discussed in the preceding chapter, the Securities Exchange Act assigns
to the Commission significant regulatory
responsibilities
for securities
markets
and persons In the secunties business.
It requires secunties exchanges to regis
ter with the Commission and provides
for Commission supervision of the selfregulatory responsibilities
of registered
exchanges. The Act requires registration
and
regulation of brokers and dealers
doing business in the over-the-counter
markets, and permits registration of associations of brokers or dealers exercising

self-regulation

supervision.
sions

under

Commission

The Act also contains

designed

to

prevent

provr-

fraudulent,

deceptive, and manipulative
acts and
practices on the exchanges and in the
over-the-counter
markets. Some recent
developments of significance in market
regulation are discussed in Part 1.

REGULATION OF EXCHANGES
Registration
The Secunties Exchange Act requires
an exchange to register with the Com
mission
as a national
securities
exchange unless the Commission exempts
it from registration because of the lim
ited volume of transactions. As of June
3D, 1972, the following
12 stock ex
changes were registered:
American Stock Exchange, Inc.
Boston Stock Exchange

Chicago Board of Trade 1

PBW Stock Exchange, Inc.2
Intermountain Stock Exchange 3
Spokane Stock Exchange

tices of the securities exchanges to de
termine adequacy and effectiveness of
self-regulation. To facilitate Commission
oversight, each national securities ex
change IS required to file with the Com
mission a report of any proposed rule
or practice change not less than 3
weeks (or such shorter period as the
Commission may authorize) before act
ing to effectuate the change.

The Honolulu Stock Exchange and
the Richmond Stock Exchange were ex
empt from registration dunng the fiscal
year. On Apnl 21, 1972, the Richmond
Stock Exchange was dissolved by Its
members, and the Commission thereaf
ter issued an order withdrawing the Ex
change's exemption from registration,
effective May 10, 1972.
During the fiscal year, two prospec
tive new exchanges, the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, Incorporated, and
the Southeastern Stock Exchange, Incor
porated, submitted informal applications
for staff review.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange
intends to limit Its initial operations to
call options 4 in approximately 20 underIymg stocks. It Intends to increase that
number gradually and to extend opera
tions to other types of options as expe
nence is gained and the market and its
regulatory arrangements are tested. The
Exchange not only would provide a mar
ket place for the irutral buyrng and sell
ing of option contracts but also would
facilitate the development of a second
ary market for the resale of options
during their lifetime. Presently, options
are initially bought and sold over-the
counter, and there IS only a very limited
secondary, over-the-counter market.
The Southeastern Stock Exchange,
which would be located In Miami, Flor
ida, would serve primarily the south

In connection with the incorporation
of these exchanges, the staff reviewed
provisions concerning indemnification of

The various exchanges have different
delisting standards. However, delisting
actions are generally based on one or
more of the following factors: the num
ber of publicly held shares or sharehold
ers is insufficlent: the market value of
outstanding shares or the trading vol
ume IS too low; the company does not
meet requirements as to earnings or fI
nancral condition or has ceased opera
tions; or required reports have not been
filed with the exchange.
During the fiscal year ending June
30, 1972, the Commission granted ex
change applications for the removal of
77 stock issues and 14 bond issues
from listing and registration. The largest
number of applications came from the
American Stock Exchange (18 stocks
and 9 bonds). Other exchanges were
represented as follows: National (21
stocks); New York (16 stocks and 3
bonds); Midwest (7 stocks and 2
bonds); Pacific Coast (6 stocks); Detroit
and PBW (4 stocks each); and Inter
mountain (1 stock).
The Commission also granted the ap
plications of two issuers to withdraw se.
curities from listing and registration on
the National Stock Exchange.

lege. This rnterpretatron
had been
issued at the Commission's urging.
As reported last year,IS the district
court granted the defendants' motion
for summary judgment. On appeal, the
Court of Appeals reversed and re
manded the case for a trial on the merItS. Relying on the Thill case, discussed
above, the court held that the fact that
the NASD "acted under close supervi
sion" of the Commission in adopting its
interpretation did not immunize It from
antitrust penalty. The court further
stated that 10 any event, the extent of
the Commission's supervision was not
readily apparent from the record and
that the record was barren of what con
sideration, if any, was given by the
Commission to the antitrust effects of
the NASD's interpretation.
The NASD sought a reheanng (which
the Commission supported in a state
ment filed with the court) urging that
the record did 10 fact reflect the extent
of the Commission's supervision over
the issuance of the Interpretation and
that such supervision distinguished the
case from Thill where it was held that
the "mere possibility" of Commission
supervision over the rules of a national
secunties exchange was not sufficient to
rrnrnuruzethe exchangefrom antitrust at
tack. The court dented rehearing. It ap
parently acknowledged that the record
did reflect the supervision exercised by
the Commission and It deleted the con
trary statement from its original opm
ion, but it reaffirmed its reliance on
Thill. The NASD thereafter petitioned
the Supreme Court for a writ of certio
rari.

The Exchange Act authorizes the
Cornrrussron to abrogate any NASD rule
If necessary or appropriate to effectuate
the purposes of the Act. During the
fiscal year, the Cornrrussron, after hear
ings, abrogated an NASD rule to the ex
tent that It permitted or had been con
strued to permit the NASD to bar the
receipt by ItS members of cornrmssions,
concessions, discounts or other allow
ances from nonmember brokers or
deaters.t?
The NASD's interpretation
had 10 effect precluded members from
joining in a distnbutron with a nonrnern
ber where the concession or discount
flowed from the nonmember to the
member. The Commission held that the
rule, as contrued and applied, was be
yond the scope of the authonty granted
to the NASD by a provrsion of the Act
authorizing it to adopt rules prohibiting
a member from dealing With a nonmem
ber except at the same pnces and on
the same terms as it accords to the
general public. This was the first case
in which an NASD rule has been abro
gated in whole or 10 part.

Inspections
The Commission is charged With the
general oversight of national securities
assocratrons in the performance of their
self-regulatory activities, and the staff
conducts periodic inspections of various
phases of NASD activity. While in the
past budgetary restnctions have se
verely limited the number of inspectrons
conducted, during this fiscal year,
largely as a result of a supplemental
appropriation received by the Commis
sion, the staff was able to inspect the
overall operations of the Association's
district offices in Dallas, Denver, Los
Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seat
tle, St. LoUIS and Washington, D.C. In
addition, the staff reviewed operations
of the National Clearing Corporation
which was established by the NASD to
provide nationwide clearing and settle
ment facilities in the over-the-counter
market.

In sustaining the NASD actions, the

that:
"In view of the vital importance of
examinations in the program of up
grading the level of competence in
the securities business, we regard
a deception in connection with the
taking of those examinations . . .
to be so grave that we would not
find the extreme sanction of revo

or oppressive unless the most ex

shown."
The Commission was unable to find that

shown here.

the Court of Appeals for the Tenth CrrCUIt affirmed the Commission's finding
that certain Emergency Rules of Fair

of Governors during the paperwork and
financial crises of 1968-1970 had been
validly adopted. The court, as had the
Commission, rejected the petitioner's ar
gument that the adoption of some rules
violated NASD By-laws and that the
rules, which petitioner had been found
to have violated, were invalid. The court
held that the NASD has the authority to
promulgate rules of fair practice in an
emergency Situation WIthout submitting
such rules to the full NASD membership
for a vote.
In Benjamin

the Court of Appeals for the Distnct of

and without opinion an order of the
Commission dismissing petrtioner's ap
plication to review disciplmary action
taken against him by the NASD. The
Court of Appeals necessanly rejected,

as had the Commission, petitioner's ar
gument that the NASD could not Im
pose upon him any penalty except cen
sure since his conduct, while concededly
contrary to just and equitable principles
of trade and therefore in violation of
the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice, was
not also found to be illegal.

Review of NASD Membership
Action
The Exchange Act and NASD By-laws
provide that no broker or dealer can be
an NASD member where he or an asso
ciate IS subject to specified disabilities.
These can only be waived under specific
findings of the Commission. A Commis
sion order approving or directing admis
sion to, or continuance in Association
membership IS generally made after ini
tial submission to the NASD by the
member or applicant for membership.
The NASD in its discretion may then file
an application with the Commission on
behalf of the petitioner. If the NASD re
fuses to sponsor, the broker or dealer
may apply directly to the Cornrnissron
for an order directing the NASD to
adrmt or continue him in membership.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, 9
applications for approval of admission
to or continuance in membership were
pending. During the year, 6 additional
applications were filed, 4 were ap
proved, and 5 were withdrawn, leaving 6
applications pending at the year's end.

types: cause, routine and oversight.
Cause examinations usually result from
complaints received from customers or
other broker-dealers, or from other intel
ligence which indtcates a need to review
certain aspects of the operations of a
particular broker-dealer, and they are
generally limited to the subject matter
of the complaint. Routine examinations,
which cover all aspects of a broker-deal
er's operations, are generally restricted
to broker-dealers which are not mem
bers of any of the self-regulatory organi
zations (SECO broker-dealers), but
members of the self-regulatory organiza
tions are also subject to such exarmna
trons, An attempt is made to examine
each SECObroker-dealer wrthin 60 days
after it becomes registered with the
Commission and to schedule routine ex
aminations of that firm annually there
after. Oversight axarrunatrons
are ex
plained below.
Broker-dealers are frequently mem
bers of more than one self-regulatory
organization. A prime concern of the
new Office has been to establish an
effective system of coordination among
the self-regulatory and other regulatory
agencies, including state regulators, to
utihze more effectively total resources
available and to avoid unnecessary and
burdensome duplicate
examinations.
The Office is developing a system
whereby each agency concerned will be
notified of exarrunations conducted of
Its members by other organizations.
The Office has also begun review of
examination polrcies and procedures of
the self-regulatory organizations to im
prove consistency in scope and proce
dures and has offered to help train ex
aminers of self-regulatory bodies.
The program also contemplates that
the Commission staff will on a sample
basis (1) examine members of self-regu
latory bodies directly to determine if
they are in compliance with the securi
ties laws, and (2) examine a member of

a particular self-regulatory organization
directly and at the same time review
the examination report and working pa
pers of the latest examination by that
organization to determine' whether its
exarninatron program is thorough and
effective.
An important function of the new
Office is to perfect an early warning sys
tem for the detection of financial and
operational problems of broker-dealers.
This system is also intended to be the
vehicle for coordination of the Commis
sion's broker-dealer examination pro
gram with the programs of the various
self-regulatory organizations. The plan is
to organize available information about
all broker-dealers registered with the
Commission, Including their financial
and operational condition, into a data
bank which would be printed out and
distributed regularly to the regional
offices of the Commission and to selfregulatory organizations.
One of the first tasks of the new
Office was the revision of the BrokerDealer Examination Manual, which out
lines the procedures and policies of the
Commission's examination program, and
the preparation of a comparable manual
for investment adviser examinations.
The manuals have been distributed to
the Commission's regional offices and
are now in use.
In addition, the Office was engaged
during the fiscal year in the develop
ment of a comprehensive examination
training program.

Rule Changes
The Commission adopted or proposed
during the fiscal year a Wide range of
measures designed to correct the prac
tices whi:h led to or intensified the op
erational and financial problems of the
secuntres industry during 1967-1970.
Among the most significant of these
measures were various rule changes or
proposed changesfor broker-dealers.

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT

Reserve and Segregation

Requirements

Legislation enacted in 1970 creating
the Securities Investor Protection Corpo
ration to provide insurance for customer
accounts explicitly authorized the Com
mission to prescribe rules regarding the
custody and use of customers' securi
ties and the use of customers' deposits
or credit balances. Such rules were to
require the maintenance of reserves
with respect to such deposits or credit
balances. The initial rule proposals were
made by the Commission in November
1971.32
On May 31, 1972, the Commission
released for public comment a revision
of these proposed rules, in the form of
a proposed new Rule 15c3-3 under the
ExchangeAct.33
The proposed rule deals with the obli
gation of a broker-dealer to maintain
physical possession or control over se
curities left with it by a customer and
to have basic reserves against customer
cash and cash realized through utiliza
tion of customer securities. It addresses
itself to three primary areas of cus
tomer protection: (1) the obligation of a
broker-dealer to promptly take posses
sion or control of all fully-paid
securities and excess margin securities
earned for the account of customers;
(2) a formula for a cash reserve for all
customer funds not used in customerrelated transactions; and (3) separation
of the brokerage operations of a firm
from its other activities.
A number of positive benefits should
flow from this approach for the protec
tion of the funds and securities of cus
tomers. The restrictions on the use of
customers' funds and securities and the
requirement that securities be promptly
brought under physical possession or
control are designed to protect cus
tomer assets in liquidation. The rule
should also act as a control over the
unwarranted expansion of a broker-deal
er's business, since it would prohibit

59

the utilization of customers' funds and
customer-derived funds 10 areas of the
firm's business such as underwriting,
trading and overhead.

"Box Count" Rule
In its Study of Unsafe and Unsound
Practices, the Commission cited the
lack of adequate physical controls over
secuntres during the 1967-1970 period.
Under the rules then in effect, that part
of the broker-dealer'soperations dealing
with the movement and location of se
curities had been subject only to the
once-a-yearcheck of the audit required
for ItS annual report of financial condi
tion. In an effort to tighten controls, the
Commission adopted Rule 17a-13
under the Exchange Act to require of
broker-dealers a quarterly physical ex
amination and count of firm and cus
tomers' securities held, and to verify se
curities subject to firm control or
direction but not rn their physical
possesslon.e- In comparing the results
of its examination and verification with
its records, a broker-dealer must note
any differences and must post unre
solved differences to its books and rec
ords within seven days. At the same
time, the Commission made conforming
changes in Its record-keeping and finan
cial reporting rules.

Financial and Operational
Condition
The Study also noted that an early
warnmg system was needed to identify
those brokers and dealers with financial
or operational difficulties before they
reach a point where liquidation is the
only answer. The Commission adopted
Rule 17a-ll under the ExchangeAct to
provide it and the various self-regulatory
organizations with an adequate and
timely flow of information on the finan
cial and operational condition of
broker-dealers.Pf
The rule has four major provisions:
(1) Immediate telegraphic notice to the

60

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Commission and to any self-regulatory
organization of which it is a member,
followed by a ftnancial report within 24
hours, when a broker-dealer's net capi
tal falls below the level required by any
capital rule to which it is subject; (2)
the fihng of special monthly
reports
until Its capital position shows improve
ment for three successive months when
a broker-dealer ascertarns that Its aggre
gate indebtedness exceeds 1,200 per
cent of its net caprtal-e--or that Its total
net capital is less than 120 percent of
the rmnirnurn net capital required of it
by any capital rule to which It is sub
ject; (3) telegraphic notice to the appro
priate regulatory authonties, followed by
a wntten report Within 48 hours, when
a broker-dealer's books and records are
not current, and (4) notification to the
Commission by a self-regulatory organi
zation when It learns that a member
has failed to give notice or file any re
port required by the rule.

New Broker-Dealer Disclosure
A contributrng factor In the failures
of broker-dealers In recent years was
the lack of adequate resources of per
sons entering the business. In its Study,
the Commission said a number of bro
kers and dealers who were able to re
main in business for only brief periods
following their registration had little or
no background in the secuntres field
and had little recognition of the need
for adequate facilities,
personnel and
financmg.
It pointed out that since the
Securities Investor Protection Corpora
tion (SIPC) may draw on the United
States Treasury up to a billion dollars
to reimburse customer losses, "to per
mit unprepared, rrresponsrble parties to
enter the broker-dealer business without
the restraining
influence of adequate
entry standards would be tantamount to
the subsidization of incompetent and ir
responsible individuals by SIPC and the
United States Treasury."
The
Commission
amended
Rule
15bl-2
under the Exchange Act to re

quire new broker-dealers to make de
tailed disclosures on adequacy of per
sonnel, facilities
and fmancing.36 The
former rule merely required applicants
for registration to furnish venfied state
ments of their financial condition. As
amended, the rule requires a new regis
trant to file in addition (1) a computa
tion of aggregate indebtedness and net
capital; (2) a statement describing the
nature and source of his capital and
representation that this capital will con
tinue to be devoted to the business; (3)
a statement
that
adequate
arrange
ments exist for facilities and fmancing
required to operate the business, detail
ing as well the nature of the arrange
ments; and (4) for the first year of
operations a statement
specifying ar
rangements for obtairung funds to oper
ate the business, anticipated expenses,
and arrangements to obtain additional
frnancmg if needed.

Net Capital
The Commission's
Study noted the
Inadequacy of existing net capital re
quirements. During the fiscal year, the
Commission
amended
Rule
15c3-1
under the Exchange Act, its net capital
rule, to increase the minimum net capi
tal required of most broker-dealers from
$5,000 to $25,000 and to reduce the
maximum net capital ratio (ratio of ag
gregate indebtedness to net capital) of
new broker-dealers for the first year of
their operations from 20-to-1 to 8-to
1.37 For broker-dealers not carrying cus
tomer accounts and not holding custom
ers' funds and securities, the $5,000
minimum was retained.
Another
amendment

agency. Because of the risks assumed
by these clearing agencies, they have
established clearing funds through de
posits by clearing members for use in
payment of liabilities of clearing mem
bers to CNS or general liabilities of CNS
arising from clearing and settling activi
ties. These funds are essential to con
tinued operation and financial secunty
of CNS clearing agencies. Because CNS
systems appear to offer substantial re
ductions In the movement of share cer
tificates, and deposits are available to
meet members' current obligations to
CNS clearing agencies, the Commission
amended Rule 15c3-1 to provide that
clearing fund deposits by clearing mem
bers of clearing agencies using a CNS
system for the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions need not be
deducted from such members' net worth
in the computation of net capital.38
Other amendments of the net capital
rule were designed to grant necessary
relief to underwriters and depositors of
contractual plans for the accumulation
of investment company shares.39 They
pertained principally to the treatment of
funds in segregated trust accounts
which must be maintained under the In
vestment Company Act and rules on
possible refund obligations.

Financial Reports
Rule 17a-5 under the Exchange Act
requires registered broker-dealersto file
annual reports of financial condition
with the Commission. As a result of the
back office and operations crisis of
1967-1970, the rule was amended this
year to require broker-dealers (other
than mutual fund dealers and other bro
ker-dealerswho do not carry customers'
accounts, or hold customer funds and
securities) to file additional information
with the Commission annually. Under
the amendment, the Commission now
receives certified Statements of Income
and Statements of Changes in Capital
Accounts in addition to the balance
sheet information previously required.

61

In addition, the amended rule now re
quires broker-dealersnot only to file re
ports with the Commission, but also to
send to customers annual and quarterly
balance sheets with statements contain
ing current net capital computations.
With the annual financial statement, the
broker-dealeralso must furnish the cus
tomer With a statement as to whether
the accountants have found material in
adequacies in the firm's internal con
trols and notification that the most re
cent annual report filed With the
Commission is available for examination
and copying at the Commission and at
the broker-dealer's principal office.4o

Clearing Arrangements
In its present form, Rule 17a-3(b)
under the ExchangeAct in effect prohrbItS broker-dealerswho are not members
of a national secuntrss exchange from
having their customers' transactions
cleared through other broker-dealerson
a fully disclosed basis. The Commission
believes it no longer necessary to pro
hibit such clearing arrangements if the
clearing broker-dealer has the financial
responsibility needed for protection of
public customers. By the same token,
exchange members who clear for other
exchange members should be required
to have the same financial responsibil
ity. A proposed amendment of the rule
would permit such clearing arrange
ments if the clearing broker-dealer
maintains net capital of not less than
$25,000 and is otherwise In compliance
with applicable net capital require

rnents.u
The Commission also proposed to
amend the rule to permit a brokerdealer to clear his transactions through
a bank, provided the books and records
respecting those transactions are kept
in accordance with the Commlssrcn's
record-keeping requirements and the
bank files an undertaking with the Com.
mission that such books and records
will be available for Commission exami

In the usual sense at or after the date
of enactment, since Congress had delib

its obligations to its customers and that
there exists one or more of the condi
tions to the appointment of a trustee
that are specified In Section 5(b) of the
Act. The court held that no hearing was
required at the time of SIPC's determi
nation because it "has no binding legal
consequences and deprives no brokerdealer of property." The court noted
that SIPC must make an application to
a district court and that the court is re
quired to make its own findings. The
court found that an appropriate deter
mination had been made by the district
court and that it was supported by the
evidence, and it affirmed the district
court's order appointing a trustee. It
also affirmed the appointment of a re
ceiver in the injunctive action brought
by the Commission which had given rise
to the application for appointment of a
trustee. The court approvingly noted
that the district court's order had ap
pointed a receiver only until SIPC made
a determination whether to seek the ap
pointment of a trustee and that the reo
ceiver had been authorized to liquidate
the broker-dealeronly if necessary.

PART 4
ENFORCEMENT

The Commission's enforcement activi
ties, designed to combat securities
fraud and other misconduct, continued
at a high level during the past year.
These activities encompass civil and
criminal court actions as well as admin
istratlve proceedings conducted inter
nally. Where violations of the securities
laws or rules are established, the sanc
tions which may result range from cen
sure by the Commission to prison sen.
tences imposed by a court. The
enforcement program is designed to
achieve as broad a regulatory impact as
possible within the framework of reo
sources available to the Commission. In
light of the capability of self-regulatory
and state and local agencies to deal

effectively with certain securities viola
tions, the Commission seeks to promote
effective coordination and cooperation
between its own enforcement actrvrties
and those of the other agencies.

DETECTION
Complaints
The Commission receives a large vol
ume of communications from the pub
lic. These consist mainly of complaints
against members of the securities in
dustry and requests for information
about Issuers. During the past year,
some 10,000 complaints and inquiries
on broker-dealers were received, most
involving operational problems, such as

68

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

a failure to deliver securities or funds
promptly, or the alleged mishandling of
accounts. While this IS a large number
of complaints, it represents a substan
tial reduction from the 17,000 com
plaints and inqurnes about broker-deal
ers receivedthe previous year.
The Commission seeks to assist
persons In resolving complaints and to
furnish requested information. Thou
sands of investor complaints are re
solved through staff inquiry to firms in
volved. While the Cornmissron
does not
have authority to arbitrate pnvate dis
putes between brokerage firms and
investors or to assist investors in legal

the National ASSOCiationof Securities
Dealers' NASDAQsystem. This program
IS coordinated with the NASD's market
surveillance staff through a review of
weekly and special stock watch reports.
For those over-the-counter securities not
traded through NASDAQ, the Commis
sion uses automated equipment to pro
vide more efficient and comprehensive
surveillance of stock quotations distrib
uted by the National Quotation Bureau.
This is programmed to Identify, among
other things, unlisted securities whose
pnce movement or dealer interest varies
beyond specrfied limits In a pre-estab

current and historic market information.
This data, combined with other available
information, is analyzed for possible fur

public investigation into the Project's allegations, by requiring Carbide to file
with the Commission a public response
to each of those allegations. The Commission's staff had met with Project
representatives and conferred with Carbide to discuss the allegations and sent
inquiries to various federal agencies.
The Commission moved to dismiss
the petition for review, asserting that It
had neither entered an "order" nor
taken any actron that was reviewable
under the judicial review provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act or of the
Administrative Procedure Act. After the
fiscal year, the court of appeals issued
an order referring the motion to the
panel of the court assigned to consider
the merits of the petition.
In the Matter of Four Seasons Securties Laws Litigation.2 The Commission,
at the request of the district court, filed
a memorandum on proposed discovery
by plaintiffs from defendants in civil litigation of testimony and documents obtained by the Cornmlssionduring a nonpublic investigation. The court also
asked the Commission to state ItS position if it were served directly with a
subpoena for the production of transcripts of such testimony. The Commission stated that, because its investigation rules permit a witness in an
investigation to obtain a copy of his
own testimony and a person who supplied documents to obtain copies, the
Commission did not object to disclosure
by a witness of a transcript of his testimony or to disclosure of documents by
the person who had supplied them to
the
Commission. The Commission
stated that it preferred that no subpoena be served on it directly for the
material in an investigatory file, because
this would not give a witness or person
supplying documents an opportunity to
488-483 0 - 73 - 7

make objections to the court on disclosure of his testimony or documents.
The Commission further stated that it
reserved the right to keep confidential
the identities of persons who had testified or supplied documents In a private
Investigation. The court in its opirnon
concuded that "the positions taken by
the SEC....
are sound." 3
S.E.C. v. First Security Bank of Utah,
N.A.4 The Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circurt affirmed the decision of
the district court which had ordered enforcement of investigative subpoenas
served by the Commission on two banks
seeking records of checking accounts of
some depositors. The court of appeals
rejected the argument of two of the depositors, that because they maintained
the checking accounts as attorneys for
their clients the records were protected
by the attorney-client privrlege and thus
immune from production. The court
stated that the records were the property of the bank, not of the depositors,
and that deposrts and disbursements of

sued by the Commission in an investigation to determine whether Mark
Petroleum Corporation had violated the
federal securities laws. The defendants
had refused to comply with the sub.
poenas, asserting that they were "illegal," overly broad and had been issued to harass them. The defendants
then requested Mr. Justice Powell of the
United States Supreme Court to stay
the district court's order, pending their
appeal. Justice Powell, however, declined to do so.

ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has available a WIde
range of possible enforcement actions.
It may in appropriate cases refer its

70

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

files to the Department of Justice with
a recommendation for criminal prosecu
tion. The penalties upon conviction are
specified in the various statutes and in
clude impnsonment for substantial terms
and fines.
The securities laws also authorize the
Commission to file injunctive actions In
the federal district courts to enjoin con
tinued or threatened violations of those
laws or applicable Cornrnissron
rules. In
injunctive actions the Commission has
frequently sought to obtain anculary re
lief under the general equity powers of
the federal distnct courts. The power of
the federal courts to grant such relief
has been judicially recognized.s The
Commission has often requested the
court to appoint a receiver for a brokerdealer or other business where investors
were likely to be harmed by continuance
of the existing management. It has also
requested, among other things, court
orders restricting future activities of the
defendants, requrring that rescission be
offered to securities purchasers, or re
quiring drsgorgernent
of the defendants'
ill-gotten gams,
The S.E.C.'s primary function is to
protect the public from fraudulent and
other unlawful practices and not to ob
tain damages for injured individuals.
Thus, a request that disgorgement be
required IS predicated on the need to
deprive defendants of profits denved
from their unlawful conduct and to pro
tect the public by deterring such con
duct by others.
If the terms of any injunctive decree
are Violated, the Commission may file
criminal contempt proceedings, as a re
sult of which the violator may be fined
or Imprisoned.
The federal securities acts also au
thonze the Commission to impose re
medial administrative sanctions. Most
commonly, administrative enforcement
proceedings involve alleged violations of
the securities acts or regulations by
firms or persons engaged in the securi
ties business, although the Commis

jurisdiction extends to all per
sons. Generally speaking, if
the
Commission finds that a respondent
willfully Violated a provision of or rule
under the securities acts, failed reason
ably to supervise another person who
committed a violation, or has been con
victed for or enjoined from certain types
of misconduct, and that a sanction is in
the public interest. it may revoke or
suspend a broker-dealer's or investment
advisers's registration, bar or suspend
any person from the securities business
or from association With an investment
company, or censure a firm or individ
ual. Proceedings may also cover ade
quacy of disclosure in a registration
statement or in reports filed with the
Commission. Such cases may lead to an
order suspending the effectiveness of a
registration statement or directing com
pliance with reporting requirements. The
Commission also has the power summa
rily to suspend trading in a security
when the public interest requires.
Proceedings are frequently completed
without hearings where respondents
waive their right to a hearing and sub
mit settlement offers consenting to re
medial action which the Commission ac
cepts as an appropriate disposition of
the proceedings. The Commission tries
to gear its sanctions in both contested
and settlement cases to circumstances
of the case. For example, it may limit
the sanction to a particular branch
office of a broker-dealer rather than
sanction the entire firm, prohibit only
certain kinds of activity by the brokerdealer during a period of suspension or
only prohibit an individual from engag
ing in supervisory activities.
A chart listing the various types of
enforcement proceedings as well as sta
tistics on such proceedings is in the

Disciplinary Proceedings
Exchange Bank & Trust
Co. of
In this case, the Commission is
sued an order censuring the bank for
Its conduct while acting as escrow agent
in a public offering of common stock of
Transceiver Corporation of America in
1969. The Commission found that the
bank violated antifraud provisions of the
securities laws by releasing from escrow
$404,750 received from subscribers for
Transceiver stock, although only 34,439
shares had been sold. Transceiver's reg
istration statement represented that the
underwriter was obligated to return all
funds received from subscribers unless
at least 130,000 shares were sold for a
total of $1,235,000. Moreover, contrary
to representations in the registration
statement on use of proceeds, the bank
received $100,000 plus interest out of
the funds released from escrow In pay
ment of a loan to Transceiver. The bank
consented to the above findings and
censure, without admitting or denying
allegations in the order for proceedings.
Executive Securities Corp.8Various re
spondents submitted settlement offers
consenting to certain findings without
admitting staff allegations against them.
The Commission found that in the sale
of stock of Executive, a broker-dealer,
the firm and its principals violated reg
istration requirements and engaged in
fraudulent practices. They withheld
shares from public sale, placed shares
with persons associated With Executive,
used nominee accounts to conceal true
ownership of Executive stock and evade
registration requirements of certain
states, and made misrepresentations to
customers. In addition, these respond
ents and an attorney violated registra
tion and antifraud provisions in the sale
of various other securities. Under the
settlement offers, the Executive stock
held by the respondent officials was to
be transferred to an attorney in trust
for three years during which an associ
ate of the attorney would be the firm's
Dallas.7

executive director. As provided in those
offers, the Commission suspended the
firm's registration for 10 days and
barred or suspended the other respond
ents from association with a brokerdealer or Investment adviser. The attor
ney was also disqualified from practice

With the right to apply for reinstatement

Gregory & Sons.? In the case of this
New York Stock Exchange member firm
which went into liquidation, and two of
its partners, It was found that the firm's
record-keeping procedures made inade
quate provisron
for distinguishing "re
stricted" secuntres (which cannot be in
cluded In a broker-dealer's net capital)
from other securities. As a result, the
firm continued In business when it was
not in compliance with the Exchange's
net capital requirements, and it filed an
inaccurate financial report With the
Commission. On the basis of settlement
offers, in which they consented to these
findings without admitting or denying
the charges against them, the firm's
registration was revoked and the part
ners suspended from association With a
broker-dealer.

Winfield & co., tnc.u In February
1972, the Commission issued detailed
Findings and Opinion. It had previously
issued orders which (on the basis of
consents of the respondents contained
in offers of settlement) imposed sanc
tions on various firms and individuals
for violations In connection with portfo
lio transactrons
of Winfield Growth
Fund, Inc., a registered investment com
pany.
The Commission found that under ar
rangements in 1966 between Winfield &
Co., the Fund's investment adviser, and
some of Its principals, and Meyerson &
Co., a New York Stock Exchange mem
ber, cornrrussrons on fund portfolio trans
actions were allocated to Meyerson for
payments to or for the benefit of the
adviser and its principals. The Commis
sion said these arrangements breached
the fiducrary obligation to the Fund and
its shareholders by the adviser and its
principals and violated antifraud provi
sions of the securities laws. It also vio
lated a provrsion
of the Investment
Company Act on acceptance of compen
sation by investment company affiliates
for the purchase or sale of property to
or for the company. The Commission
found that proper valuation procedures
were not followed for "restricted" secu
rrties in the Fund's portfolio and that
some respondents failed to make rea
sonable investigations before causing
the Fund to purchase those securities.
Edward A. Merkle.1t In a proceeding
under the Investment Company Act
against the chref executive officer of
Madison Fund, lnc., a registered invest
ment company, it was alleged that Mer
kle, in violation of the securities acts,
caused Madison Fund: (I) to purchase
time certificates of deposit and place
non-interest bearing demand deposits in
commercial banks in return for loans by
those banks to several companies affili
ated with Madison Fund and Merkle; (2)
to enter into transactions involving port

folio securities on a joint, or joint and
several, basis with Mad International
Fund, lnc., an unregistered off-shore in.
vestment company of which Madison
Fund was investment adviser and Mer
kle, chairman of the board; and (3) to
purchase securities of National Indus
tries, Inc. without disclosing that he
was a salaried employee of National. In
July 1972, the Commission entered into
a settlement with Merkle in which, with
out admitting or denying the allega
tions, he consented to findings that he
had committed these violations and to a
6D-<laysuspension.
Proceedings were also instituted dur
ing the fiscal year against Herbert F.
Korholz, chief executive officer and a
director of The Susquehanna Corpora
tion, and a director of Pan American
Sulphur Company (Pasco); Emmett H.
Bradley, also an officer and director of
Susquehanna and Pasco; Susquehanna.
which owned a majority of Pasco's
stock; and four national banks. The pro
ceedings are based on staff allegations
that, among other things, Korholz, Brad
ley, and Susquehanna caused Pasco,
which is subject to the Investment Com
pany Act, to purchase certificates of de
posit from the banks as an inducement
for the banks to extend credit to Sus
quehanna and a subsidiary. Thereby, it
is alleged, the respondents violated or
aided and abetted violations of a prohi
brtion under the Act against joint trans
actions between a registered investment
company and its affiliates without au
thorrzation by the Commission.

Pursuant to an offer of settlement
made by PSI in which it consented to
the above findings without admitting or

order, permitted withdrawal of the regis
tration statement, and dismissed the
proceeding with respect to the annual
report, which PSI had corrected by
amendment, on condition that PSI dis
tnbute copies of the Commission's opin
ion to its stockholders.IS
The Commission also entered orders
in two other proceedings in which its
staff had challenged the accuracy of fi
nancial statements included in annual re
ports filed with the Commission. Both
proceedings were disposed of on the
basis of settlement offers providing for
appropriate amendment of the reports
and notification to stockholders of the
corrections. In one case, Great South

Trading Suspensions
The Securities Exchange Act author
izes the Commission summarily to sus
pend trading in a security traded on
either a national securities exchange or

in the over-the-counter market for a pe
riod of up to 10 days if, in the Commis
sion's opinion, It is required in the pub
lic interest.
During fiscal 1972, the Commission
suspended trading in the securities of
47 companies, an increase of about 83
percent over the 26 securities sus
pended in fiscal 1971. In most in
stances thrs action was taken because
of substantial questions as to the ade
quacy, accuracy or availability of public
information concerning the company's
financial condition or business opera
tions or transactions in its securities.
Trading suspensions are frequently a
prelude to other enforcement action.
The following summaries illustrate the
variety of circumstances which may lead
to suspension.
In March, 1972, trading In the securi
ties of First Fidelity Company was sus
pended at the request of the company
which advised that it was engaged in
negotiations of a material transaction,
and that the results of the negotiations
would be made public shortly. The Com
rnissron lifted ItS suspension after First
Fidelity had issued a press release and
disseminated a shareholder letter which
disclosed the transfer of substantially
all the assets of a subsidiary and re
lated financial information.
In the case of Tanger Industries,
trading was suspended on the American
Stock Exchange and in the over-the
counter market in May, 1972 to allow
time for the clarification of questions
raised on the validity of and circum
stances surrounding the placing of cer
tain orders for transactions in Tanger
securities. After an intensive investiga
tion, the Commission, in July, filed a
complaint seeking to enjoin Tanger, its
former chairman, and ten others from
violating antifraud and registration pro
visions of the Federal securities laws.
The complaint alleged that the defend
ants were involved in an elaborate
scheme to raise the price of Tanger
stock by controlling and absorbing the

grossly inadequate and unfair considera

cllegatlons,
In June, 1972, the Commission sus
pended trading on the New York, Pacific
Coast and PBW Stock Exchanges and in
the over-the-counter market in the secu
rities of Levitz Furniture Corporation. It
acted as a result of an investigation,
prompted by a review of a then pending
registration statement, that raised ques
tions as to the disclosure of material
facts.
The Commission
subsequently
filed a complaint seeking an injunction
against Levitz and three of its officers,
charging that the registration statement
was materially
misleading, and It also
instituted
stop order proceedings (dis
cussed previously).
Thereafter
it lifted
the trading suspension.
In announcing
the termination
of
trading
suspensions,
the Commission
generally cautions investors to consider
all available information
in making any
investment decision on the securities in
question, and it reminds broker-dealers
who solicit transactions
In such securi
ties of their obligation to make diligent
inquiry to determine all pertinent finan
cial and other information about the is
suer and to disclose such information
to prospective purchasers.

Judicial Review
Quinn & Co., Inc. v. S.E.C.21 The
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
affirmed an order of the Commission
imposing sanctions upon Quinn & Co.,
Inc., a broker-dealer, and Its vice-presi
dent, John Dornacker. The court sus
tained the Commission's
finding that
Dornacker and the partnership

cessor of Quinn & Co., had violated the
Securities Act by selling unregistered se

ties from the issuer In exchange for
property.
The court agreed with the
Commission that the customer had pur
chased the unregistered shares from the
issuer with a view to "distribution"
and
therefore was a statutory
underwriter
whose resales were not exempt from
registration,
even though
the shares
represented less than 1 percent of the
Issuer's outstanding stock. Because the
customer was an underwriter,
the ex
emptions
provided for transactions
by
brokers and dealers in Sections 4(3)
and 4(4) of the Securities Act were held
to be unavailable. The court further sus
tained the Cornrrussron's
finding
that
the violations
were Willful, concluding
that the brokerage firm and Dornacker,
as professionals in the securities busi
ness, were not entitled to rely upon the
absence of cautionary
legends on the
customer's
stock certificates
but were
under a duty to investigate In order to
assure themselves that the sales com
plied with the requirements of the Secu
rities Act.

CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
During fiscal year 1972, the Commis
sion instituted a total of 119 injunctive
actions, as well as two civil contempt
actions. Some of the more noteworthy
of these injunctive proceedings and sig
nificant developments
in actions insti
tuted
in earlier
years are described
below.

to finance a manipulation
of the overthe-counter

particularly the stock of National Bank

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

Carr, a former Attorney General of
Texas, John Osorio, a former Chairman
of the TexasState InsuranceCommission,
National Bankers Life, and others from
violating the registration and antifraud
provisions of the secunties laws. Sev
eral defendants consented to a perma
nent injunction, and the complaint was
dismissed agamst five corporate defend
ants which were then involved in receiv
ership or conservatorship proceedings
or controlled by a receiver. After a tnal,
the distnct court granted an injunction
against all but one of the rernarrnng
defendants.22 Four of these defendants,
including Carr and Osono, appealed to
the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit.23 In Its brief in the court of ap
peals, the Commission argued that, as
found by the lower court, the appellants
had violated the registration provisions
of the secunties Act by pledging unreg
istered shares of control stock where
there was no reasonable likelihood at
the time of the pledge that the loan
could be repaid otherwise than through
foreclosure and eventual public sale of
the collateral, and that they partrcipated
in a scheme to manipulate the market
pnce of National Bankers Life stock and
two other securities by arranging for
financing to buy up shares of these
securitres
on the open market, thereby
taking such shares off the market and
driving up the price.
In February, 1972, the Commission
Instituted a civrl injunctive action
against 20 defendants In SEC. v. Ne
tional Student Marketing Corporation
(NSMC),24 alleging violations of the re
porting, proxy and antifraud provisions
of the Securities ExchangeAct, and the
antifraud provisions of the Securities
Act. The defendants include, in addition
to NSMC, six of its present and former
officers and directors; the corporation's
auditors, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.
(PMM), and a partner and a former em
ployee of that firm; NSMC's outside
legal counsel, the New York law firm of
White & Case, and one of its partners;

four officers and directors of Interstate
National Corporation, with which NSMC
merged; Interstate's outside legal coun
sel, the Chicago law firm of Lord, Bis
sell and Brook, and two of its partners,
one of whom was also a director of In
terstate; and a lawyer representing the
purchasers of a former subsidiary of
NSMC.
The complaint alleges that various fi
nancial reports of NSMCdisseminated to
the public and filed with the Commis
sion, beginning with its 1968 annual
report, were materially false and
misleading because they included In in
come certain purported commitments
from customers to use NSMC's services
in the future. According to the com.
plaint, these commitments were nonex
rstent or were entered into after the
close of the fiscal period in which they
were recorded as income or contained
guarantees by NSMC which precluded
their being recorded as income. The
complaint also alleges that a large part
of the commitments included as income
In the 1968 annual report was written
off during 1969, but that proper disclo
sure of the write-off was never made.
A portion of the complaint concerns
NSMC's merger with Interstate, an in.
surance holding company, in 1969. One
of the conditions to the merger was the
issuance by PMM of a "comfort letter"
which was to state, among other things,
that PMM had no reason to believe that
NSMC's unaudited financial statements
for the nine-month period ended May
31, 1969, which were contained in a
proxy statement that had been used to
solicrt shareholder approval of the
merger, required any material adjust
ments in order that the results of oper
ations for the period be fairly pre
sented. Instead, according to the
cornplarnt, the letter issued by PMM
stated that it believed that adjustments
reducing net Income from $700,000 to
a loss were required. The complaint al
leges that the merger was consum
mated and the lawyers issued favorable

THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL
opinions

on its legality

notwithstanding

their
knowledge that shareholder
ap
proval had been obtained on the basis
of materially false and misleading finan
cial statements.
It IS further alleged that certain Inter
state shareholders present at the clos
ing sold
a portion
of their
newly
acquired NSMC stock on the day of the
closing notwithstanding
their knowledge
that the most recent financial
state
ments of NSMC available to the public
were materially false and misleading.
Further, the complaint
alleges that
NSMC improperly accounted for a pur
ported gain on the sale of two subsidi
aries even though these sales did not
occur until after the close of the fiscal
year In which it was reported, that It
was not disclosed that NSMC retained a
number of financial and other obliga
tions with respect to these subsidiaries,
that it was highly unlikely that the full
sales price would
ever be paid to
NSMC, and that NSMC's president had
transferred
to the purchasers of the
subsidiaries the NSMC stock they had
pledged as collateral for their promis
sory notes.
On July 26, 1972, a consent judg
ment of permanent injunction was en
tered
against
NSMC, which
neither
admitted nor denied the allegations of
the complaint.
The judgment
granted
the full relief requested In the com
plaint, including a provision obligating
the company to file corrected reports
with the Commission after making an
independent investigation
of its affairs
from 1968 through early 1970, the pe
riod covered by the complaint.
Other cases: SEC v. Umted Frnancia!
Group, Inc.25 A Commission SUIt insti
tuted in the United States District Court
for the District of Oregon alleged that
United, 17 of its subsidiaries or affili
ates and six officers of various corpo
rate defendants violated the registration
and anti-fraud provisions of the securi
ties acts. According to the complaint,
United is a world-wide complex of more

REPORT

77

than 80 companies Including off-shore
mutual funds, real estate and insurance
companies and banks. On the Commis
sion's motion for a preliminary injunc
tion, the defendants did not contest the
Commission's
allegations
but argued
that United States courts lacked juris
diction of what the defendants claimed
were extraterritonal acts.
The district
court found, however,
that the defendants' activities were sub
ject to the provrsions of the Federal se
cuntres laws since (1) the defendants
had used the tacrhties of interstate
commerce to offer and sell securities to
United States citizens and residents and
to operate their corporate empire from
within the United States, and (2) their
activities,
originating
in and directed
from the United States, had caused
substantial and irreparable harm both
to domestic and foreign Investors and
creditors and could adversely affect the
ability of American Issuers to raise capi
tal abroad. The court entered prelimi
nary injunctions against each of the de.
fendants. Having found that there was a
real threat of dissipation
of valuable
corporate assets by the individual de
fendants, the court also appointed a re
ceiver for the complex. The orders of
the district court have been appealed by
certain of the defendants to the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth ClrcUlt.26
S.E.C. v. Pig 'N Whistle Corporation.27
The Cornmissrcn obtained consent de
crees of permanent Injunction against a
number of defendants alleged to have
participated in violations of the Federal
securities laws in connection with the
distribution of the stock of Pig 'N Whis
tle. The consenting defendants included
Financial Relations Board, Inc. (FRB), a
Chicago-based
public
relations
firm
which had been engaged by Pig 'N
Whistle. FRB allegedly violated antifraud
and antrtouting provisions by distnbut
ing press releases which contained false
and misleading Information
about the

investigation, and without disclosing the

fact that it was acting on behalf of and

from
Pig 'N

FRS is enjoined from further violations,
provided that It will not be deemed to
have violated the decree In connection
with any statement made or distributed
by it if, after an investigation,
it has
reasonable
cause to believe that the
statement
is accurate. The decree also
required
FRS to establish
procedures
for screening prospective clients and for
investigating the facts contained in any
release distnbuted on behalf of a client.

S.E.C.

v.

Manor

Nursing

Centers,

Inc.28 This action arose out of an "ail
or-nothing"
public offenng
of Manor
common stock on behalf of Manor and
certain of its principal stockholders. The
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
affirmed an order of the district court
enjoining
various defendants
from vio
lating the antifraud and prospectus-de
livery provrsions of the Federal securi
ties laws. The court also upheld, with
one
minor
modification,
the
district
court's grant of ancillary
relief, which
(1) recurred the defendants to disgorge
the proceeds received from the public
offering, (2) ordered the appointment of
a trustee to receive and distribute such
funds to defrauded
Investors and (3)
temporarily
froze the assets of the de
fendants
pending their transfer of the
proceeds to the trustee.
The Commission
had alleged that
Manor and the selling-stockholder
de
fendants had violated provisions of the
secunties
laws by retaining
the pro
ceeds received from investors in the of
fering
even though
all
the
offered
shares had not been sold and payment
received.
It charged
that,
after
the
effective date of the Manor registration
statement,

defendants
realized
that the offering would not be success
ful and, aided and abetted by the un
derwriter and other defendants, engaged
In a fraudulent
scheme to make it ap
pear that the Issue was sold out. Manor

been
represented,
while
the
selling
stockholders
were paid in full at the
closing.
In affirming the district court's find
rng of violations of the antifraud provr
sions, the court of appeals held that the
failure to return to the public proceeds
obtamed In an "all-or-nothmg"
offering,
where the preconditions for retention of
the funds are not satisfied, IS a misap
propnation of the proceeds, which con
stitutes a fraud on investors. It further
held that the antifraud provisions are VI

After the decision, the distnct court,
on remand, ordered two of the defend.
ants to pay over to the trustee more
than $700,000.
At fiscal year-end ap
peals from these orders were pending.29
S.E.C. v. Shapiro.30 The Commission
alleged violations of Rule 10b-5 under
the Securities
Exchange Act Involving
transactions
in the securities of Har
vey's Stores, lnc., traded on the Ameri
can Stock Exchange. The Commission
charged that the defendants
had pur
chased stock without
disclosing
nonpublic matenal Information
of proposed
mergers involving
Harvey's,
and said
some of them had passed on the infor
mation to friends who then purchased
shares. The defendants
had obtained
the Information either by virtue of their
positions
as directors
or controlling
stockholders
of Harvey's, or as parties
privy to the merger negotiations,
or
through having been "tipped"
by per
sons having direct access to the infor
mation. In addition to Injunctive
relief
against future violations,
the Commis
sion sought an order directing the de
fendants
to disgorge
to a court-ap
pointed trustee any profits realized or
accrued from their own transactions
or
those of their "tippees".
All of the de
fendants except two-against

complaint alleged, among other things,
that lIT and some of its insiders had
violated antifraud provisions by selling
secunties without disclosing significant
developments in settlement negotiations
in an antitrust case Involving lIT. All
defendants consented to injunctions as
requested in the complaint.
S.E.C.
v. Advance
Growth
Capital
Corporation. 32 The
Commission
had
flied a complaint
In 1969 charging,
among other things, that the chairman
of the board and the president of Ad
vance, a registered
investment
com
pany, each had caused the company to
enter into a series of transactions with
various affiliated persons of the invest
ment company or the board chairman
without obtaining advance Commission
approval as required under the Invest
ment Company Act. In August 1971, the
district court rendered its decision denyIng the Commission's
request for in
junctive relief and the appointment of a
receiver.
It
found
that,
while
the
transactions
in question
had violated
the Investment Company Act, the viola
tions
had not been intentional.
The
Comrnissron has appealed to the Court
of Appeals for the Seventh CIrCUlt,33
urging that the drstnct court's finding of
lack of intention was clearly erroneous
and that, in any event, the Commission
was not required to prove Intent
in
order to obtain injunctive relief and the
appointment of a receiver.
S.E.C. v. Century Investment

defendants, to create a public market

distribution
of unregistered
shares of the common stock of four
shell corporations.
One of the defend

ern Distnct of New York agreed With the
Comrrussron's
positions and entered an
order prelrrnmanly
enjorrung the defend
ants. The court found that the attor
ney's misleading opinion letters, which
It said went beyond mere errors in legal
judgment, were crucial to the drstnbu
non of unregistered securities and that
he had aided and abetted the scheme.
An appeal was taken by the attorney to
the Court of Appeals for the Second
CircUlt.36
The decision of the distnct court was
consistent with an earlier decrsion In
S.E.C. v. Budin & CO.,37 where it was

S.E.C. v. Continental
Tobacco Co. of
South Carolina, Inc.39 The United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
held, contrary to the decisron of the drs
trict court, that Continental's sale of un

80

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

registered securities to about 40 per
sons, for a total of' $140,000, was not,
as claimed, an exempt "private offer
ing" under Section 4(2) of the Securi
ties Act, and that the sale therefore vio
lated the registration provisions of that
Act. The court ruled that Continental
failed to sustain its burden of proving
by explicit, exact evidence that each of
feree of the unregistered stock had a	
relationship with Continental giving him
access to the kind of information that
registration would have disclosed. Al
though Continental had distributed a
brochure containing information about
the company and Its secunties, the
court stated that mere disclosure of in
formation does not assure entitlement
to the exemption for nonpublic offer
ings. Offerees of unregistered securities
should also have the ability, by reason
of their facility for acquiring information
about the issuer, to verify for them
selves the accuracy of the disclosure.
Such ability, the court Indicated, was
not possessedby all of Continental's of
ferees since some of them lacked per
sonal contacts with Continental's man
agement
prior
to
acquiring
the
unregistered securities.
S.E.C. v. Computer Statistics, Inc.
The United States District Court for the
District of Columbia40 denied the de
fendant's motion to dismiss the action
for improper venue, or in the alterna
tive, for a transfer of venue and granted
the Commission's cross-motion for sum
mary judgment enjoining the defendant
to file timely and proper periodic re
ports. On appeal,41the defendant con
tends that the district court should have
transferred venue to the Northern Dis
trict of Texas where the defendant has
its principal place of business and
should not have granted the Commis
sion's motion. It argues that there was
an issue of fact whether a reasonable
likelihood of future violations existed In
light of its assertion that it would at
tempt to comply with the reporting re
quirements in the future.

SEC. v. Realty Equities Corporation
of New York.42 A permanent injunction
enjoming the defendant from failing to
comply with reporting requirements
under the Exchange Act was entered,
despite its contentions that ItS past fail
ure to file the required reports on a
timely baSISwas the result of factors
beyond ItS control. The company ac
knowledgedthat it had been delinquent
in its reporting over a 5-year period. At
the time the Cornrnissron's action was
instituted on December 31, 1971, the
company was delinquent in filing its an
nual report for its fiscal year ended
March 31, 1971, and its quarterly re
ports for the first two quarters of its
1972 fiscal year. Trading in the com
pany's securities on the American Stock
Exchange had been halted in August
1970 becauseof its failure to file reports
on time.
The district court held that bad faith
and fraud need not be shown to war
rant an injunction. It stated that the de
linquencies were willful "In the sense
they were not the result of mistake, ac
cident or inadvertence but rather re
sulted from a series of factors, includ
ing financial pressures some years back,
inadequate staff, lack of necessary
financial records found in acquired com
panies, broken promises by retained ac
counting firms and management's fail
ure to place timely reporting in priority
status." The court noted that while as
surances had been given that these
matters were now under control, the de
linquencies had continued after the suit
was instituted, and that similar assur
ances had been given to the Commis
sion in the past.

to the Commis

needed in view of the difficulty

mining whether the defendants

Participation

as Amicus Curiae

The Commlssron
frequently partici
pates as amicus curiae in litigation be
tween private parties under the securi
ties law where it considers it important
to present its views regarding the inter
pretation of the provisrons involved. For
the most part, such participation is In
the appellate courts. During fiscal 1972,
the Cornrnlssron
filed amicus curiae
briefs In 20 cases and participated as
Intervenor In two cases.
Supermtendent of Insurance v. Bank
ers LIfe and Casualty Co.50 The Su
preme Court. adopting views expressed
by the Commission as amicus curiae,
unanimously reversedthe holding of the
lower courts that the complaint of the
Superintendent of Insurance had failed
to state a claim for relief under Section
10(b) of the Securrties Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
The Superintendent had alleged that
Manhattan Casualty Company, a New
York Insurance company, had been de
frauded by its' sole shareholder into sell
rng nearly $5 million of ItS portfolio se
curities on the assumption that the
proceeds from the sale of the securrtres
would be returned to the company. In
stead, the Superintendent had alleged,
the defendants misappropriated the pro
ceeds of the sale to the detriment of
the company. The defendants had
argued, among other things, that the
fraud, If any, was a self-inflicted wound
and that, accordingly, no claim for relief
had been stated.

The Supreme Court, affirmatively rec
ognizing the existence of a private right
of action under Section 10(b) for the
first time, held that the Securities Ex.
change Act "protects corporations as
well as Individuals who are sellers of a
security." The Court recognized the
broad purpose underlying Section 10(b)
and, In noting that the "crux of the
present case IS that Manhattan suffered
an injury as a result of deceptive prac
tices touching its sale of securities as
an investor", stated:
"Hence we do not read Section
10(b) as narrowly as the Court of
Appeals; it is not 'limited to pre.
serving the integrity of the securi
ties markets' ... , though that pur
pose is Included. Section 10(b)
must be read flexrbly, not techni
cally and restrictively. Since there
was a 'sale' of a 'security' and
since fraud was used 'in connec
tion with' It, there is redress under
Section lO(b) ....
(T)he fact that
creditors of the defrauded corpora
tion buyer or seller of securities
may be ultimate victims does not
warrant disregard of the corporate
entity."
Affiliated
Ute Citizens v. United
States.51 The Cornmlssron urged rever
sal of a decision of the Court of Ap
peals for the Tenth Circuit concerning
the application of Rule 10b-5 under the
Securities Exchange Act to the sale of
certain stock by mixed-blood Indians of
the Ute Tribe. The Supreme Court, in
accordance with the positions urged in
the Commission's brief, rejected the
view of the court of appeals that, under
the circumstances of the case, involving
primarily a failure to disclose, proof of
reliance on material misrepresentations
of fact was necessary to recover dam
ages for a Violation of Rule 10b-5. The
Supreme Court stated that the defend
ants devised a plan and induced the In
dians to dispose of their shares without
disclosing to them material facts that

THIRTY-EIGHTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

83

reasonably could have been expected to
influence their decisions to sell.
The Supreme Court also rejected the
court of appeals' view of the measure
of damages. It held that the correct
measure of damages was the difference
between the fair value of all that the
sellers received and the fair value of
what they would have received had
there been no fraudulent
conduct, ex
cept for the situation where the defend
ant received more than the seller's ac
tual loss. In the latter case, damages

Cattlemen's
Investment
Co.
v.
Fears.52 The district court, as urged by
the Commission,
construed
the term
"tender offer" In Section 14(d) of the
Securities
Exchange Act (part of the
"Williams
Bill")
to include acqursition
by the defendant of more than 5 per
cent of the common stock of an issuer
as a result of active and widespread so
licitations of public shareholders on an
mdividual basis, in person, over the tel
ephone and through
the mails. The
Court adopted the Commission's
view
that, although tender offers were usually
made by newspaper advertisements, the
means employed by the defendant were
even more designed
"to force a share
holder into making a hurned investment
decrsion without access to mforrnation,
In circumvention
of the statutory
pur
pose." The court further concluded, as
urged by the Comrnissron,
that the pur
poses of the Williams Bill would best be
served by giving the plarntiff target cor.
poration standing to sue for an injunc
tion and by granting an injunction even
though the only showing of Irreparable
harm was the defendant's failure to file
a required report under Section 14(d).

final judgment, Leasco and the mdivrd
ual defendants moved the court for an
order declanng that Leasco's Intention
to pay the entire Judgment and not to
seek contribution
from the lndividuals
would not contravene public policy as
expressed in the Securrttes
Act. This
motion was made pursuant to an under'
taking in Leasco's registranon statement
which paralleled that contained In the
note to Rule 460 under the Securities
Act. That note expresses the Cornrrus
sion's opinion that such Indemnification
is against public policy and thus unen
forceable and generally provides for the
registrant to subrnrt the question to a
court for adjudication should a claim for
indemnification be asserted against it.
In a memorandum filed by the Com.

After the Commission

The Birnbaum Doctrine. As amicus

has continued
to urge rejection of the doctrine estab
lished by Birnbaum
v, Newport Steel
Corp.56 that permits only a purchaser or
a seller of secunties to recover rnone
tary damages In a pnvate action under
Section
lO(b)
of the Secunties
Ex.
change Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
In Mount Clemens Industnes
Inc. v.
Bell,57 the plaintiffs alleged that they
had been mduced to refrain from bid.
dmg on and purchasing securities at a
sheriff's
sale because of misrepresen
tation by one of the defendants. The
Commission
expressed the view that
neither the legislative history nor the
language of Section lO(b),
and Rule
10b-5 thereunder, restrict the ambit of
those provisions to purchasers and sell
ers of securities. The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, however, held that
the purchaser-seller Imutatron was a de
srrable method for effecting what it con
srdered to be the congressional intent,
and it suggested that this limitation
might be a matter
of constitutional
necessity. In Manor Drug Stores v, Blue
Chip Stamps,58 an action
presently
pending before another panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
the plaintiffs allege that as a result of
the defendants' misrepresentations
they
were induced to refrain from purchasing
secuntres offered in connection with the
settlement
of an antitrust
action. The
Commission urged this panel to reject
the purchaser-seller
limitations.
In a

by the panel, the Commission explained
its disagreement
with the Mount CJe

by Canadian de
fendants to refrain from selling certain

THIRTY-EIGHTH
securities. On appeal to the Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the Commission took the position, as amicus
curiae, that there should be a private
right of recovery under Section 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5 whenever an Investor
has been fraudulently Induced to refrain
from buymg or sellmg securities, as well
as when he has been fraudulently
induced to purchase or sell. The Commission also took exception to the district
court's determmation that there was no
JUrisdiction under the Federal securities
laws because there were not sufficiently
substantial
acts committed
within the
United States in connection with the alleged violation. The Commission noted
that the defrauded victims were in the
United States at the time deceptive
statements were made to them by telephone and that the Securities Exchange
Act applied to communications
between
any foreign country and any state.
After a rehearing en banc, the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in
Drachman v. Harvey,60 reversed the dismissal of a share-holders' derivative suit
that

corporation for losses allegedly suffered
when defendants caused an improvident
redemption of convertible debentures to

it necessary to repudiate the Birnbaum

the court held to be secuntresj.s- The
defendants
promised to provide loans
for prospective
borrowers and caused
them to pay them an advance fee in re
turn for a loan commitment
letter. In
fact, no loan was ever placed or con
summated and with few exceptions the
fees paid were not returned. The court
charactenzed the defendants' acts as a
"carefully
designed scheme to defraud
persons seeking equity capital or mort
gage money."
In a case involving the first cnrrunal
prosecution
for violation
of Section
17(e)(1)
of the Investment
Company
Act, the Court of Appeals for the Sec
ond Circurt upheld the conviction of Jer
ome Deutsch for aiding and abetting
the Violation of that provision by a co
defendant.65
Deutsch,
an
officer
of
Realty Equities Corporation,
attempted
to place $12 million of Realty's prornis
sory notes With institutional
investors.
His efforts were unsuccessful until he
convinced the co-defendant,
Frank D.
Mills, senior officer of the Investment
adviser for 12 mutual funds, to pur
chase notes for one of those funds.
Thereafter, Deutsch was able to place
the entire Issue. After Realty had con
tracted
to repurchase
several notes,
Mills, usrng a nominee account, pur
chased one of those notes through
Deutsch for $537,000. Three days later
one of the funds, of which Mills was a
vice-president, purchased identical notes
for $928,125 per note. Section 17(e)(1)
forbids affiliated persons of an invest
ment company from accepting, while
acting as agent, any outside compensa
tion for the purchase of any property
for the Investment company. The court,
after ruling that the statute was not un
constitutionally
vague, stated that "The
objective of Section 17(e)(1) IS to pre
vent affiliated persons from having their
judgment and fidelity Impaired by con
flicts of interest. It is clear that, as
soon as Mills purchased the Realty note

at a reduced pnce, he was inhibited by
a conflict of interest which could easily
becloud his judgment to the detriment
of the benefrcianes of the funds." The
court held that the JUry was justified in
finding that Deutsch's sale to Mills of
the note at a discount was "compensa
tion in appreciation of past conduct."

Organized Crime Program
The prosecution of securrties cases is
often based on circumstantial
evidence
requiring
extensive
investigation
by
highly trained personnel. The difficulties
in such prosecutions are compounded
when elements of organized crime are
involved. Witnesses are usually reluctant
to cooperate because of threats or fear
of physical harm. Books, records, and
other documentary
evidence essential
for successful prosecution may be de
stroyed or nonexistent.
The organized
cnrnmal element is prone to disguise
transactions by using nominees and tak
ing advantage of foreign bank secrecy

THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT
laws. It frequently
operates
through
"fronts"
and infiltrates legitimate busi
ness concerns. Organized crime has an
extensive network of affiliates through
out this country m all walks of life, and
in many foreign nations.
Despite these difficulties,
the Com
mission,
working
in cooperation
with
other enforcement
agencies, has been
able to make major contributions to the
fight against organized crime. Members
of ItS staff, including a special unit in
the headquarters office, assist the De
partment of Justice and its various or
ganized crime "strike forces" in the in
vestigation and prosecution of securities
cases involving
organized
crime.
For
example, the Commission,
m coopera
tion with the New York Strike Force, as
well as the New York Police Department
and the New York County District Attor
ney's Office, participated in the investi
gation and successful
prosecution
of
certain defendants, including Arthur Tor
torello,
John
Dennett
and Frederick
Hesse, for Violating the antifraud and
registration provisions of the securities
acts in connection with the financial af
fairs of Underwriter
Investment
Com
pany. The defendants caused the prepa
ration of inflated balance sheets for
that company, which was in fact a cor
porate shell. They then engaged in a
complex scheme to distribute the over
valued shares to the public. Six defend
ants pled guilty prior to trial. Tortorello
and Dennett were found guilty after
trial.
They
have
appealed
their
convictions.68
In another significant case, the Com
mission's
staff participated
With the
New York Strike Force in the trial result
ing in the convictions of John Lombar
dozzi, Hilmer Sandine, Leslie Zacharias,
Samuel Benton and William Hamilton of
securities fraud, mall fraud, and con
spiracy to defraud investors m connec
tion with transactions
in the stock of
Picture Island Computer Corporation.69
Two other defendants, Peter Crosby and
Dinty Whiting, failed to appear for trial,

87

and became fugitives from justice.
Evidence produced during the sixweek trial revealed that the defendants
caused more than 23 million unregis
tered shares of Picture Island stock to
be distributed
throughout
the United
States, Europe and South America. In
connection with the distribution,
they
disseminated
fmancial statements and
shareholder reports which falsely stated
that Picture Island had assets rn excess
of $50 million. In fact, the company
was a nearly worthless shell. Among the
assets claimed for Picture Island were
3112 million acres of government-owned
off-shore oil lands in the Arctic, which
were assigned a value of over $31 mil
lion. After the trial, Lombardozzi, San
dme, and Zacharias jumped ball and be
came fugitives from justice. The other
defendants were expected to be sen
tenced in the fall of 1972.
In addition to providmg direct assist
ance to the Justice Department and ItS
"strike forces" in the investigation and
prosecution of organized crime cases,
the Commission
also participates
rn
other ways, both direct and rndirect, in
the fight against organized crime. The
Chairman of the Commission is a mem
ber of The National Council on Orga
nized Crime. Quarterly reports concern
ing organized cnme investigations
are
submitted
to the Justice Department.
The Cornrnisston
also frequently
sup
plies mformation from its extensive files
on publrcly-held
companies and brokerdealers to the Justice Department and
other agencies engaged in fighting or
ganized crime. A potential contnbution
of great significance relates to the prob
lem of securities theft. Securities worth
hundreds of millions of dollars are sto
len each year from brokerage firms,
banks, insurance companies, and other
institutions.
Organized cnme is respon
sible for much of this theft. Although
the Commission has no direct responsi
bility in the area of stolen securities, its
current efforts looking toward the immo
bilization of stock certificates in central

88

depositories will greatly reduce the op
portunities for securities theft.

Proposed Swiss Treaty

has connnued
its
participation

Assistance In Criminal Matters between

lems between the two working groups.
The matter now awaits a deterrnmatlon

concerned
as to
what further action they may desire to
take.

COOPERATION
ENFORCEMENT

WITH OTHER
AGENCIES

In recent years the Cornrrussron
has
given increased emphasis to cooperation
and coordination
of ItS own activities
WIth the
various
other
enforcement
agencies,
including
the self-regulatory
organizatrons
and enforcement agencies
at the state and local level as well as
certain foreign agencies. Its programs in
this area cover a broad range. For ex
ample, the Cornrnissron
believes that
certain
cases, where
the
violations,
whrle
mvolving
the Federal securities
laws, are of a local nature, are more ap
propnately
enforced at the local rather
than the Federal level. In these in
stances the Commission
authorizes re
ferral of the case to the appropriate
state or local agency, and members of
the staff familiar With it are made avail

able for assistance to that agency in its
enforcement
action.
One recent such
case involved Dempster Investment Co.
and ItS president who were found guilty
by a Michrgan state court of selling un
registered secunties in VIolation of that
state's securities law. The Commission
had previously obtained a Federal court
order enjorning the defendants from vio
lating registration
and antifraud
provi
sions of the Federal securities laws. The
case was initially developed through a
JOint mvestigation
by the Cornrnissron's
staff
and
the
Michigan
Secunties
Bureau,?1
The Commission
has also fostered
programs designed to provide a compre
hensive exchange of information
con
cerning mutual
enforcement
problems
and possible securities Violations. Dur
rng the fiscal year, it continued its pro
gram of regional enforcement
confer
ences held once a year within each of
nine regions. These
the Cornrrusston's
conferences are attended by personnel
from state securities agencies, the U.S.
Postal Service, Federal, state and local
prosecutors' offices and local offices of
self-regulatory
associations such as the
NASD. They provide a forum for the ex
change of Information
on current en
forcement
problems and new methods
of enforcement cooperation.
One result
of these conferences has been the es
tablishment of programs for joint inves
tigations. Although the conferences were
lrutrally hosted by the Cornrnissron's
re
gional offices, many state agencies are
now serving as sponsors.
The Cornrnisston
IS constantly seeking
ways to Improve these conferences. One
innovation that has been tried in some
regions is to open one session to the
brokerage
community
and to private
practitioners
in the securities field. The
resulting exchange of views has so far
proven to be very beneficial to all con
cerned. It is planned to follow this prac
tice in the future at other regional con
ferences.
Dunng the past year the Commission

THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL
reinstituted
its
annual
enforcement
training program, after a lapse of one
year. The more than 150 persons In at
tendance included, In addition to Com
mission personnel, 30 persons from var
ious state agencies,
15 from
other
Federal agencies and 7 representatives
from Canada, 2 from
Mexico and 1
from Panama. The program seeks to im
part an understanding of how the secu
rities markets operate, explain applica
ble rules, suggest desirable investigative
procedures,
Indicate
how
available
enforcement
remedies can best be uti
lized and provide guidance In connec
tion with the trial of securities cases.
The Commission's
Section of Securi
ties Violations
provides
one of the
means for cooperation on a continuing
baSIS with other agencies having en
forcement
responsibilities.
This Section
acts as a clearinghouse for Information
regarding securities enforcement actions
taken by state and Canadian authorities,
other governmental
and self-regulatory
agencies, and the Cornrnissron itself. It
answers requests for specrfic
informa
tion, and in addition publishes a pe
nodrc SV Bulletin which IS sent to con
tributing
agencies
and
to
other
enforcement
and regulatory
agencies.
During fiscal year 1972, the Section re
ceived 4,212 letters either providing or
requesting
information,
and sent out
2,457 communications
to cooperating
agencies.
Records maintained
by the
Section reflect a steady Increase In re
cent years In the number of enforce
ment actions taken by state and Cana
dian authorities.
The data In the SV files (which are
cornputerized) is useful in screening ap
plicants for registration as securities or
commodities brokers or dealers, Issuers
and investment advisers, as well as ap
plicants for loans from such agencies
as the Small Business Administration
and the Economic Development Admin
istration
of the Department
of Com
merce.
The Wanted Supplement to the SV

criminal
actions. As an example of results attain
able through coordination and coopera
tion
between agencies, an individual

to be in Honolulu using an alias. He
was seized through the [ornt efforts of
San Francrsco Office,
the Cornrnlssron's
the Honolulu

and
the State of California.

FOREIGN RESTRICTED LIST
The Commission maintains and publi
cizes a Foreign Restricted List designed
to alert broker-dealers, financial institu
tions, Investors and others to possible
unlawful drstrrbutrons
of foreign securi
ties. The list consists of names of for
eign companies

sued by companies on the list. Thrs
does not necessarily prevent promoters
from Illegally offering such secunties di

The number of companies on the list in
creased from 54 on June 30, 1971, to
60 at the end of the 1972 fiscal year.
The following companies were added to
the list durmg the year:

PART 5
INVESTMENT COMPANIES
AND ADVISERS

Under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, the Commission is charged
with extensive regulatory and supervi
sory responsibilities over investment
companies and investment advisers. Un.
like the other federal securities laws
which emphasize disclosure, the Invest.
ment Company Act provides a regula.
tory framework within which investment
companies must operate. Among other
things the Act: (1) prohibits changes in
the nature of an investment company's
business or Its Investment policies with
out shareholder approval; (2) protects
against management self-dealing, em
bezzlement or abuse of trust; (3) pro
vides specific controls to elimmate or

mitigate inequitable capital structures;
(4) requires that an investment com
pany disclose its fmancial condition and
Investment policies; (5) provides that
management contracts be submitted to
shareholders for approval, and that pro
vision be made for the safekeeping of
assets; (6) prohibits underwriters, in
vestment bankers, or brokers constitut
ing more than a minority of an invest
ment company's board of directors; and
(7) sets controls to protect against
unfair transactions between an invest.
ment companyand Its affiliates.
Persons advising others on their se
cunty transactions for compensation
must register with the Commission
under the Investment Advisers Act of

95

96

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

1940. This requirement was extended
by the Investment Company Amend
ments Act of 1970 to include advisers
to registered investment companies. The
Adviser's Act, among other things, pro
hibits performance fee contracts which
do not meet certain requirements;
fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative
practices; and advertising which does
not meet certain restrictions.
The August, 1972, reorganization of
the Commission for the first time
placed responsibility for both invest
ment companies and investment advis
ers in one Division, the Division of In
vestment Company Regulation. This
union should enhance the ability of the
Commission to oversee the activities of
these important elements of the invest.
ment community and enable the Com.
mission to deal comprehensively with
problems involving the economics, dis
tribution methods and services in the
growing money management field com
plexes.

ECONOMIC, REGULATORY
MATTERS
Investment companies provide an im
portant means for the pooling of the
collective resources of individuals in the
nation's capital markets. Investor confi
dence is vital to their success in attract
ing the savings of individuals, and the
safeguards provided by the Investment
Company Act contribute to sustaining
such confidence.
A dramatic example of the impor
tance of investor confidence IS found in
the continued acceleration of the inter
nationalization of the caprtal markets.
Because of the degree of investor confi
dence existent in this country, our secu
rities markets have historically served
as a magnet for foreign investors.
One of the vehicles created to meet
this demand from foreign investors has
been the establishment of offshore
funds-investment
companies created
to trade in the United States securities
markets, but which are domiciled in for

eign countries in order to avoid regula
tion by the Commission and to achieve
tax advantages. Because of their foreign
domicile. these funds are not registered
under the Act and generally operate
free of regulation. In many cases, how
ever, their sales practices have been too
aggressive, and their disclosures inade
quate. Moreover, the managers of these
funds are generally not subject to re
strictions against overreaching, on the
extent of their compensation, or on
their use of fund assets.
In response to this problem, the
Commission on August 11, 1971, an
nounced the formation of an Inter
agency Task Force, consisting of repre
sentatives
of
the
Commission,
Department of State, Department of
Treasury and the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System in order to
consider the possible development of a
regulated vehicle which would still pro
vide appropriate tax advantages for for
eign residents. The Task Force has com
pleted substantially all of its work, and
it is expected that shortly the Commis
sion and the Department of Treasury
will propose legislation to the Congress
which will extend the regulatory policies
of the Act to at least some offshore
funds.
Another business area where the
Commission deems further regulation
necessary for investor protection and to
stimulate investor confidence is that of
oil and gas programs. As discussed in
Part 1 of this report, the Commission
has submitted proposed legislation to
the Congress designed to provide such
regulation. Both the Commission and
the oil and gas drilling industry recog
nized that increasing national demands
for energy require large amounts of
capital for exploration and that such
capital may be more difficult to raise if
in addition to the risk of a drilling ven
ture investors must also bear the risk of
being treated unfairly. The proposed leg
islation took the Investment Company
Act as its model.

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT

Mutual Fund Distribution
Since the adoption of the Investment
Company Act, perhaps no facet of
open-end investment company activity
has received greater attention than the
distribution process for the shares of
such companies. The past year was no
exception. The Commission's concern
over the cost to investors of participat
ing in mutual funds and over regulatory
problems associated with the distnbu
tion system was manifested in a num
ber of areas.
It has been a widespread practice to
use fund brokerage commissions to re
ward broker-dealers for sales of fund
shares. This practice, however, creates
a myriad of economic and regulatory
problems. Among other things, there is
a danger that a retailer of fund shares
will base his recommendations not on a
customer's needs but rather on the rel
ative amounts of brokerage he can ex
pect from different funds. In addition,
the need of a mutual fund to allocate
brokerage as a reward for sales of its
shares can create pressures for unnec
essary portfolio transactions. And the
practice of allocation can have serious
anti-competitive effects in that larger
funds have more brokerage available for
compensation to fund sellers.
To correct these problems and poten
tial for abuse, the Commission, in its
Statement on the Future Structure of
the Securities Markets, concluded that
the practice of using brokerage from
the portfolio transactions of mutual
funds to reward broker-dealers for sales
of fund shares must be terminated.
Subsequently, the National Assocratlon
of Securities Dealers proposed an
amendment to its Rules of Fair Practice
Which would bar the reciprocal practice
of giving or receiving portfolio brokerage
business as an inducement to or reward
for the sale of fund shares.
The elimination of the cloud caused
by reciprocity will better enable the
Commission to determine the conse

97

quences of a repeal of the "retail price
maintenance"
provislon of
Section
22(d) of the Act.
Section 22(d) precludes the sale to
public investors of redeemable invest
ment company securities which are
being currently offered to the public by
or through an underwriter except at a
current publlc offering price described
in the prospectus. The Committee on
Banking and Currency of the United
States Senate had requested in 1969
that the Commission review the poten
tial consequences of repeal of the sec
tion and report its findings to the Com
mittee. The Commission's staff has
been engaged in a study of the poten
tral economic impact of the repeal of
Section 22(d) on the funds themselves,
principal underwriters, retail sales orga
nizations and their salesmen, the invest
ing public and the stock market. The
staff report is expected to be submitted
to Congressearly in fiscal 1973.
The recent liberalization of the Com
mission's
mutual
fund
advertising
rules 1 may also have an Impact on the
distribution process. Rule 134 under the
Securities Act was amended to permit
the expansion of mutual fund "tomb
stone advertisements" in include a gen
eral description of an investment com
pany,
ItS attributes,
method
of
operation and services. Rule 434A
under the Securities Act was also
amended to permit mutual funds for
the first time to use an abbreviated
form of prospectus containing all of the
basic information contained in the full
prospectus, but omitting some of the
detailed information. Although this sum
mary prospectus may not be used in
lieu of the statutory prospectus with
sales literature, it can be used alone as
a newspaper advertisement or mailer
prior to the delivery of the full prospec
tus. The Commission adopted a new
Rule 135A under the Securities Act gov
erning generic advertising of mutual
funds. It provides that generic advertise
ments may contain general explanatory

98

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

information about mutual fund shares,
the nature of investment companies and
services offered by mutual funds. Most
importantly, in contrast with past inter
pretations of the Securities Act which
effectively limited the use of generic ad
vertising to those securities dealers who
made available a wide range of mutual
funds, under the new rule such adverns
ing may be used by any mutual fund
underwriter or adviser. Thus, those
members of the securities industry who
have the greatest interest in communi
cating the mutual fund concept to the
public now have the opportunity to do

so.
The Commission views the changes
made so far as only a modest step in
liberalizing mutual fund advertising
rules, and has invited interested per
sons to submit additional rule propos
als.
The need to develop new markets for
fund shares is a product of increased
competition for investors' savings. One
means adopted by certain funds to at
tract investors has been to reduce or
eliminate the sales load previously im
posed on sales of their shares.
Finally, it can be reasonably expected
that one consequence of the Commis
sion's opinion in United Funds, Inc.2 will
be a reduction in costs to some share
holders of Investment companies. In
that case, the Commission granted an
exemption from Section 22(d} of the
Act to permit shareholders of United
Funds and certain other open-end in
vestment companies who redeem their
shares to use the recemption proceeds
to repurchase shares within 15 days
without the payment of an additional
sales load. The companies and their un
derwriter requested the exemption on
the basis that it had been their experi
ence that a substantial number of
shareholders redeemed their shares
without being aware that they could
borrow money on the security of those
shares or could exchange shares of one

of the funds for those of another fund
without paying a sales load.
The Commission held that it would
be equitable to permit shareholders who
had mistakenly redeemed shares to cor
rect their mistakes without paying an
other sales load. by the end of the
fiscal year a number of other invest
ment companies had applied for a simi
lar exemption.

NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS
As of June 30, 1972, there were
1,334 investment companies registered
under the Act, with assets having an ag
gregate market value of nearly $81 bil
lion. Compared with corresponding to
tals at June 30, 1971, these figures
represent a decline of 17 in the number
of registered companies but an increase
in the market value of assets of nearly
$3 billion, for another new high since
the Act was passed. At June 30, 1972,
3,811 investment advisers were regis
tered with the Commission, representing
an increase of 326 over a year before
and a new record total. Further data is
presented in the statistical section of
the report.
During the fiscal year, the staff of the
Commission conducted 106 investment
company inspections and 148 invest
ment adviser inspections, representing
increases of 10 percent and 22 percent,
respectively, over the prior fiscal year.

SPECIALIZED INVESTMENT
COMPANIES
A number of registration statements
processed by the Division during the
fiscal year indicated the continuing in
terest of other financial institutions in
the investment company vehicle and the
development of specialized objectives
and investment methods as a means of
competing for investors' interest.
Following the Supreme Court's deci
sion in Investment Company Institute v.
Camp,3which held that the operation of
a mutual fund by a national bank is

THIRTY.EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act,
First National City Bank (Citibank) dereg
istered its Commingled Investment Ac
count. However, in January 1972, the
Federal Reserve Board amended its reg
ulations to permit bank holding compa
nies and their subsidiaries to act as in
vestment
advisers
to
registered
investment companies, subject to cer
tain limitations. Under this amendment,
Citibank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
First National CIty Corporation, has be
come the investment adviser to Advance
Investors Corporation, a closed-end in
vestment company. Although it is a
closed-end investment company (l.e., its
shareholders do not have the right to
have the company redeem their shares),
Advance may make purchases of its
shares from time to time in market
transactions as it deems advisable and
has the right to borrow amounts up to
an aggregate of 20 percent of its net
assets for this purpose.
Similarly, Independence Income Secu
rities Company, Inc., a closed-end in
vestment company, entered into an in.
vestment advisory arrangement whereby
Providence National
Bank,
acting
through its Trust Division, acts as in
vestment adviser for the company and
performs all administrative functions for
It. The Commission's staff was advised
by the Federal Reserve Board and the
Comptroller of the Currency that they
considered this arrangement permissible
under the banking laws notwithstanding
the Supreme Court decision referred to
above.
The Dreyfus Third Century Fund, lnc.,
whose registration became effective duro
ing the fiscal year, invests in companies
which, "in the opinion of the Fund's
Management, not only meet traditional
Investment standards, but also show ev
idence in the conduct of their business,
relative to other companies in the same
industry or industries, of contributing to
the enhancement of the quality of life
in America as this nation approaches
the Third Century of its existence." The

99

factors which the Fund considers in
making its investment decisions include
performance In the areas of environ
ment, occupational health and safety,
consumer protection and product purity,
and equal employment opportunity.
Minbanc Capital Corp., a closed-end
non-diversified management investment
company, was created at the instance
of the Urban and Community Affairs
Committee of the American Bankers As
socration for the purpose of making
capital funds available to qualifying
minority-owned banks. During the fiscal
year, it registered shares for an offering
to banks which are members of the As
sociation. According to Minbanc's pro
spectus, funds may be made available
to any bank "at least 50 percent of
whose voting securities are owned, or
which is managed, by individuals from
minority groups in the United States
which are under-represented in its free
enterprise system, and which has an
operating history of three years or
more."
The Bache-Huntoon Paige Ginny Mae
Fund, Series I, will sell units of benefi
cial interest in a fund composed of
"mortgage-backed securities" guaran
teed as to payment of principal and in
terest by the Governent National Mort.
gage
Association
(Ginny
Mae).
Mortgage-backed secuntres are issued
against a pool of VA and FHA mort
gages which have been collected by
mortgage bankers or other similar insti
tutions. The pooling arrangement per
mits such institutions to obtain a Ginny
Mae guarantee prior to the issuance of
the securities. The Fund is an open-end
diversified investment company de
signed to seek high income.
First Real Property Securities Fund,
Inc. will invest primarily in securities of
entities engaged in various real estate
activities. The Fund expects that a sub
stantial portion of its assets will be in
vested in companies in the formative
stages of their development which will
have no public market for their securi

100

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

ties. These portfolio companies gener
ally will be formed by developers who
will supervise construction on and man
agement of real estate properties. Be
cause information about the portfolio
companies will generally not be avail
able from other sources, the Fund will
supply shareholders with such informa
tion in its periodic reports.

APPLICATIONS
One of the Commission's principal
activities in its regulation of investment
companies is the consideration of appli
cations for exemptions from various
provisions of the Act or for certain
other relief. Applications may also seek
determinations of the status of persons
or companies under the Act. During the
fiscal year, 326 applications were filed
and final action was taken on 406 appli
cations. As of the end of the year, 141
applications were pending.
An investor in a periodic payment
plan for the gradual acquisition of the
shares of a registered investment com
pany may change his investment objec
tives before he has completed the plan.
First Investors Corporation applied for
permission to enable an investor in a
Plan sponsored by it for the acquisition
of the shares of Wellington Fund, to ex
change his Plan for another, also spon
sored by First Investors, to acquire
shares of First Investors Fund for
Growth without losing credit for the
"front-end" load already paid. The Com
mission approved the proposed ex
change offer and granted an exemption
from the retail price mamtenance provi
sion of the Act to permit credit to be
given for past payments on Wellington
Fund Plans when determining the sales
charge to which future payments on
Fund for Growth Plans would be
subject.s
Under the Act, an affiliate of a regis
tered investment company, such as its
investment adviser, cannot participate
in a joint arrangement with the invest
ment company absent Commission ap

proval. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insur
ance Company, which proposed to
sponsor and act as adviser of MassMutual Corporate Investors, Inc. (Fund),
a closed-end investment company, ap
plied with the Fund for approval of an
arrangement whereby the insurance com
pany would invest concurrently for its
general account in each issue of securi
ties purchased by the Fund at direct
placement an amount equal to that in
vested by the Fund, and would exercise
warrants, conversion privileges and
other rights at the same time and in
the same amount. In support of the ap
plication, it was represented that the in
surance company had a nationally rec
ognized position as a source of capital
funds and as a purchaser of investment
securities to be issued at private place
ment and as a result attracted issuers
in all parts of the country and engaged
in a wide variety of Enterprises. These
investment opportunities were to be
made available to the Fund under the
proposed arrangement. The Commis
sion, finding that the Fund's participa
tion in the proposed arrangement would
not be less advantageous than that of
the insurance company, gave its ap
proval, subject to certain safeguards
which the applicants had proposed.P
In First Multifund
of America,
Inc.,6
the applicants sought a declaratory
order that it would be lawful for mem
bers of the NASD who are underwriters
of the shares of mutual funds to grant
concessions to other members of the
NASD who act as brokers for purchas
ers of such shares, not excluding bro
kers who are affiliated persons of such
purchasers. The Commission determined
that where an investment company's
adviser, which is also a registered brokerdealer, effects purchases for the com
pany's portfolio of shares of other
investment companies on which the ad
viser receives concessions from the un
derwriters of the selling companies, the
adviser acts as a "broker" for the affili
ated investment company even though

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
the selling agreements between it and
the underwriters of the selling companies characterize it as a "dealer", and
as such is entitled to receive and retain
concessions which do not exceed 1 percent of the purchase price.

RULES AND GUIDELINES
Continued implementation of the Investment Company Amendments Act of
1970 as well as the normal continuing
review of rules in light of changing conditions and administrative experience resulted in the revision of various rules
under the Investment Company and Investment Advisers Acts during the fiscal
year.

Performance

Fees

Prior to the 1970 amendments of
Section 205 of the Advisers Act, compensation arrangements between investment companies and their advisers
based on portfolio performance were
often unfair to the companies and their
shareholders. Many such fees were not
symmetrical, in that they did not decrease where performance was poor or,
if they did, decreases were disproportionate to increases for good performance. The 1970 amendments to Section
205 were designed to align, as nearly
as possible, the interests of the adviser
and the investment company by correcting imbalances in incentive fee arrangements.
These amendments prohibit all performance fees unless compensation
increases and decreases proportionately
with investment performance of the
company over a specified period in relation to the investment record of an appropriate index of securities prices. The
point from which increases and decreases in compensation are measured
must be the fee which is paid or earned
when the investment performance of
the company is equivalent to that of the
index.
During the fiscal year, the Commission published for comment a proposed
488-483 0 • 73

9

101

Rule 205-1 under the Advisers Act. The
rule, in modified form, was adopted in
August, 1972.7 The rule is designed to
assure that "investment performance"
of an investment company is computed
on the same basis as the "Investment
record" of an index, so as to make the
two comparable. It requires that all incrernents-e-dlstnbutlons of realized capital gains and dividends paid out of investment income, the value of capital
gains taxes paid or payable on undlstributed realized capital gains, and all
cash distributions of the companies
whose stock comprises the index-be
treated as reinvested when computing
both "investment performance" and
"investment record."

Series Companies
Another rule published for comment
in fiscal year 1972 and thereafter
adopted in modified form is Rule 18f-2
under the Investment Company Act.8
Implementing an amendment contained
In the Investment Company Amendments Act of 1970, the rule is designed
to insure fair and equitable treatment of
shareholders of investment companies
of the series type.9 The rule requires series investment companies, as a requisite
for taking action on a matter requiring shareholder authorization, to obtain
the approval of each individual class or
series of its stock which would be affected by such matter. Certain matters,
such as those in which the interests of
the series are substantially identical, are
exempted from the separate voting requirements. The rule also has special
provisions concerning investment advisory contracts and investment policies
which give individualized treatment to
separate series.

Capital Gains Distribution
In its report to Congress proposing
amendments to the Investment Company Act, the Commission proposed an
amendment to limit capital gains distrlbuttons of registered investment cornpa-

PUBLIC-UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANIES
Under the Public Utility Holding Com
pany Act of 1935, the Commission regu
lates interstate public-utility holdingcompany systems engaged in the
electric utility business and/or retail
distribution of gas. The Commission's
jurisdiction also covers natural gas pipe
line companies and other non-utility
companies which are subsidiary compa
nies of registered holding companies.
There are three principal areas of regu
lation under the Act: (1) physical inte
gration of public-utility companies and
functionally related properties of hold
ing-company systems, and simplification
of intercorporate relationships and finan
cial structures of such systems; (2)
financing operations of registered hold

ing companies and their subsidiary com
panies, acquisition and disposition of
securities and properties, as well as cer
tain accounting practices, servicing ar
rangements, and intercompany transac
tions;
(3)

provisions,
provisions relating to the status under
the Act of persons and companies, and
provisions regulating the right of per

pany to become affiliated with another
such company through acquisition of

after its close) by the same two cities.
It approved the acquisition by Middle
South of the common and preferred
stocks of Arkansas-Missouri Power Com
pany, an unaffiliated company. The
Commission conditioned its approval
upon Middle South's filing a plan under
Section nee) of the Act to eliminate
any resulting minority interest 9 and
upon the divestment of the gas utility
and ice business of Arkansas-Missouri.10
The cities filed petitions for review of
the Commission decision. At the end of
the fiscal year the matter was under ad
visement by the court of appeals.!1
Union Electric Company.12 Union, an
exempt holding company and an electric
and gas utility company, applied to ac
quire (through an invitation for tenders)
the outstanding shares of common
stock of Missouri Utilities Company, a
nonassociate electric and gas utility
company. Hearings were concluded dur
ing the fiscal year and briefs were filed
with the hearing officer. The Division of
Corporate Regulation opposed the appli
cation. The Division urged, among other
things, that the proposed exchange offer
is not reasonable; that the expansion of
a combined electric and gas utility sys
tem is contrary to the Act; and that
Union has failed to make the requisite
showing of economies and efficiencies
to result from the proposed acquisition.
The Division also opposed granting a re
quested exemption to Union under Sec
tion 3(a)(2), except upon the conditions
that (1) the gas properties of Union
and its subsidiary companies, and (2)
the gas and water properties of Mis
souri Utilities be divested.
Two proceedings pending before the
Commission for decision at year-end
present the question of whether a hold
ing company, whose utility operations
are intrastate but which diversifies into
unrelated non-utility activities, is enti
tled to an intrastate exemption. The Di

109

vision has taken the position that such
activities are detrimental to public,
investor and consumer interests, and
that therefore their retention precludes
the grant or continuation of the exemp
tion. In one of the cases, an application
for exemption was filed by National Util
ities & Industries Corp., whose utility
subsidlary company, Elizabethtown Gas
Company, distributes natural gas at re
tail in New Jersey.13 In Pectiic Lighting
Corporation, proceedings were instituted
by the Commission to
determine
whether an exemption granted to Pacific
in 1936 should be revoked or modified
because of Pacific's diversification into
non-utility ventures unrelated to the op
eranons of its utility subsidiary com
pany, Southern California Gas Com
pany.14

FINANCING
During fiscal 1972, a total of 16 ac
tive registered holding-company systems
issued and sold 67 issues of long-term
debt and capital stock for cash, aggre
gating $2.79 billion 15 pursuant to au
thorizations granted by the Commission
under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act. All
of these issues were sold at competitive
bidding to raise new capital. The public
utility financing table in the statistical
section presents the amount and types
of securities issued and sold by these
holding company systems.
The volume of external financing dur
ing fiscal 1972 set a new record, repre
senting an increase of 13 percent over
fiscal 1971, the previous record year.
Preferred stock and common stock is
sued and sold increased by 101 percent
and 24 percent respectively, while the
amount of debentures issued and sold
in fiscal 1972 decreased by 77 percent
from fiscal 1971.
This unprecedented volume of financ
ing was accompanied by further deterio
ration in the earnings coverages of in
terest and preferred dividends. For the
calendar year 1971, the 17 active regis
tered holding-company systems earned

(after taxes) as compared to 2.19 times

LEGISLATION
During the fiscal year, a bill (5. 1991,
92nd Cong.) which would amend the
Act to grant authority to the Commis
sion to permit companies subject to the
Act to invest limited amounts in low
and moderate cost housing projects
under programs subject to certain fed
eral housing statutes was reported fa
vorably by the Senate Committee on
Commerce. On July 21, 1972, the Sen
ate passed an amended version of S.
1991. An identical bill was introduced in
the House (H.R. 6711), but no commit.
tee report has been issued. This legisla
tion was an outgrowth of a Commission
decision 16 holding that such investments
were not permissible under the Act in
its present form.

no authority to veto a plan of reorgani

The Commission has not considered
it necessary or appropriate to partici
pate In every Chapter X case. Apart
from the excessive administrative bur
den, many of the cases involve only
trade or bank creditors and few public
investors. The Commission seeks to par
ticipate principally in those proceedings
in which a substantial public investor
interest is involved. However, the Com
mission may also participate because
an unfair plan has been or is about to
be proposed, public security holders are
not represented adequately, the reorga
nization proceedings are being con
ducted in violation of important provi
sions of the Act, the facts indicate that
the Commission can perform a useful
service, or the Judge requests the Com
mission's participation.
The Commission in its Chapter X ac
tivities has divided the country into five
geographic areas. The New York, Chi
cago and Seattle regional offices and
the San Francisco branch office of the
Commission each have responsibility for
one of these areas. Supervision and re
view of the regional and branch offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of
the Division of Corporate Regulation of
the Commission, which, through its
Branch of Reorganization, also serves
as a field office for the southeastern
United States.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES
In fiscal 1972, the Commission en
tered 12 new Chapter X proceedings in
volving companies with aggregate stated
assets of approximately $234.9 million
and aggregate indebtedness of approxi
mately $119.4 million.
Including the new proceedings, the
Commission was a party in a total of
113 reorganization proceedings during
the year.! The stated assets of the com
panies involved in these proceedingsto
taled approximately $1.5 billion and
their indebtednessabout $1.2 billion.

During the year, 14 proceedings were
closed, leaving 99 proceedings in which
the Commission was a party at fiscal
year-end.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
In Chapter X proceedings, the Com
mission seeks to have the courts apply
the procedural and substantive safe
guards to which all parties are entitled.
The Commission also attempts to se
cure judicial uniformity in the construc
tion of Chapter X and the procedures
thereunder.
King Resources Company.2 An invol
untary petition was filed in the district
court in Dallas. The petition was ap
proved and a trustee appointed. The
Commission joined in a motion to trans
fer the proceedings to Denver, the loca
tion of the debtor's prmcipal office. This
motion was made by the indenture
trustees for $39.5 million of outstand
ing debentures, and by banks holding
$13 million of notes. The Commission
pointed out that neither the debtor's
office nor any significant part of the as
sets were located in the Northern Dis
trict of Texas and that Denver was the
most convenient forum.
The transfer was recommended by
the special master and was ordered by
the district judge. The case is now pro
ceeding in the district court in Denver.3
In a pending appeal,« petitioning credi
tors are urging that the judge did not
afford them an opportunity to file ex
ceptions to the special master's recom
mendations pursuant to Rule 53 of the
Federal Rules. The Commission filed a
brief supporting the transfer, urging
that the order conformed to the stand
ard practice in the Texas district court,
that it did not prejudice appellants' ap
peal, and that the departure from Rule
53 was permitted by the General Order
37.
Waltham Industries Corporation.5 The
Debtor moved its corporate offices from
New York City to Los Angeles, and filed
a voluntary Chapter X proceeding in

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
Los Angeles about two months later.
The Commission supported objections
to the venue by a major shareholder
and by substantial eastern creditors.
The debtor had its operating division In
Massachusetts; nine of its 12 subsidiar
ies were located in the northeastern
United States; and the one California
subsidiary had ceased operations. Most
of the creditors were in the northeast,
and only one employee had moved to
California when the offices had been
moved there.
The district judge overruled the objec
tions. An appeal was taken by a
creditcr.s and In the meantime the ad
ministration progressed In the California
court. The appeal was subsequently dis
missed by stipulation.
Dextra
Corporation.7
The debtor
amended its Chapter XI petition to
transfer the proceedings to Chapter X
when it was unable to work out by
agreement its problems with secured
creditors. The special master found that
the debtor's petition was not filed in
"good faith" Within the meaning of Sec
tion 146(3) since no reorganization
under Chapter X was possible. Objec
tions to the speciat master's report
were overruled by the district judge who
dismissed the Chapter X petition.
Transfer to Chapter X pursuant to
Section 328 merely decides that no ade
quate relief is available in Chapter XI.
The amended Chapter X petition must
also satisfy the "good faith" provision
of Section 146(3). This determination is
made when the amended Chapter X pe
tition is presented to the distrrct judge
for approvat.s

Computer

Trade creditors opposed the trustee's
petition to include trade creditors and
the public holders of the debtor's de
bentures in the same class. They urged
separate classification on the grounds
that their interests were different and
that classification immediately after ap
proval of a Chapter X petition, before

115

any plan was contemplated, was prerna
ture.
The district court granted the trust
ee's petition and the trade creditors ap
pealed. The court of appeals, as urged
by the Commission, affirmed. In a per
curiam opinion, the court, assuming
that the district court's order was ap
pealable, stated that appellants' conten
tions were "unimpressive." 10
Landmark Inns of Durham, Inc.ll The
court of appeals affirmed the refusal of
the reorganization court to permit the
ground lessor to forfeit the lease and
take possession of a motel constructed
by the debtor, at a cost of $1.5 million,
on land leased for a 52-year term.P Al
though the lease expressly provided for
termination on the passageof any inter
est to a trustee or receiver In bank
ruptcy, the court held that such termi
nation would be highly unconscionable
and inequitable and "a demand for
blood" and that as a court of equity the
bankruptcy court had the discretion to
refuse enforcement of the forfeiture.
A petition for certiorari was denied by
the SupremeCourt.
Bubble Up Delaware, Inc., et a/.13
The trustee proposed to sell outside of
a plan substantially all of the debtor's
properties to a third party. The trustee
relied on Section 116(3) as authority
for such sale.14 At the hearing on the
proposed sale, another potential pur
chaser of the assets appeared and bid
against the purchaser selected by the
trustee. In accordance with the Commis
sion's recommendation, the court in
structed the parties to submit proposed
plans of sale to the trustee, so that the
sale would be made through a plan,
which requires a vote of security hold

A sale of substantially all of the debt

After a hearing, the court ruled that

An objection had also been filed to

grounds that he was an investor in a

had undertaken to withdraw from the

Imperial '400' National, tnc., et alP
The distnct court was informed by
counsel for the trustee that a client of
his firm had expressed an interest in
proposing a plan of reorganization for
the debtor, and that the client had retained another law firm to represent it
in the Chapter X proceedings should it
decide to file a plan of reorganization.
The district judge notified all inter.
ested parties that in his judgment the
client was not precluded from submitting a plan provided that counsel for
the trustee refrained from participation
In any way with respect to the plan.
The district judge also indicated that
the trustee, himself a lawyer, would
handle this aspect of the proceedings
and invited comments with respect to
the proposed procedure. Counsel for the
trustee would continue to represent the
trustee on all other matters.
In a letter to the district judge the
Commission suggested that the arrange488-483 0 - 73 - 10

ment should be clarified to state that
counsel for the trustee play no part in
any aspects of the proceeding that relate to plan proposals, so long as his
client is involved in the proceeding.The
attorney for a substantial creditor, who
was also chairman of the creditors'
committee, did not object to the retention of counsel for the trustee subject
to these safeguards. The Commission's
suggestion was accepted by the district
judge.
Subsequently, the Judicial Council of
the Third Circuit adopted a resolution to
the effect that when a client of counsel
for the trustee or of his firm submits a
plan, the restnctions Imposed by the
distnct Judge are not sufficient to provide immunity against "the appearance
of a conflict of Interest." 18 In view of
this resolution, the district Judge dismissed counsel for the trustee, who had
declined to step aside voluntanly. He
has appealed,19 and the Cornrrussron
filed a bnef affirming the views it had

indenture trustee for an Issue of Euro
dollar debentures proposed to resign to
avoid a possible conflict of Interest and
sought to have the Chapter X court ap
point a successor indenture trustee. The
Chapter X trustee, a large bondholder,
and the Commission did not oppose the
resignation but objected to the appoint
ment of a successor indenture trustee.
The Commission urged that a succes
sor was not required when a substantial
individual bondholder, who was partici
patmg actively in the proceeding, would
be an adequate representative of the
interests of the class. The appointment
of a successor would, therefore, unnec
essarily increase the costs of the pro
ceeding. The court allowed the inden
ture trustee to resign but refused to
appoint a successor.
Four Seasons Nursing Centers of
America, Inc.22 The court, in confirming
the plan of reorganization, appointed
the trustee as a director and as initial
president of the reorganized company.
Although such appointment was only for
a four-month term. expiring at the first
meeting of shareholders, the appointee
will be eligible for re-election. The Com'
mission has consistently opposed this
practice. In view of the importance of
the matter, and the unsettled state of
the law,23 it deems it appropriate to
restate its position on this important
question.
A good trustee, who has successfully
coped WIth a difficult situation and re
vived a falling business, is a very ob
vious choice when the search begins for
an executive for the reorganized com
pany. He is likely to have the
confidence of the creditors and the em
ployees. All selfish considerations aside,
he may well feel obligated to carry on
the work he has begun.
The Commission's opposition to such
an appointment is not based on a pre
sumption of corruption or improper pa

tronage, but on a belief that the possi
bility of the trustee continuing to be
associated with the reorganized com
pany subverts the disinterested role
fixed for him by Chapter X. Much more
than crude bargaining for salary or ten
ture is involved. The trustee has many
critical decisions to make during the
proceedmg and in preparing a plan of
reorganization: The retention or disposi
tion of property, the accumulation of
liquid funds as opposed to maximum
distribution to creditors, the new capital
structure, with particular attention to
how and to whom voting power would
be distributed, and the choice between
internal reorganization and sale of the
enterprise. If the trustee has even one
eye on subsequent employment, his
judgment on these matters may be af
fected.
All such decisions can easily be ra
tionalized as in the best interests of the
reorganization. But the court and the
parties are entitled to have wholly disin
terested decisions of the trustee, not
decisions that may be subtly shaped by
a tendency to identify himself with the
debtor's future.

TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION
A complete accounting for the stew
ardship of corporate affairs by the prior
management is a requisite under Chap
ter X. One of the primary duties of the
trustee is to make a thorough study of
the debtor to assure the discovery and
collection of all assets of the estate, in.
eluding claims against officers, direc
tors, or controlling persons who may
have mismanaged the debtor's affairs,
The staff of the Commission often aids
the trustee in his investigation.
Federal Coal Company.24 There was a
substantial identity between the public
holders of the debtor's debt and equity
secunties, since income bonds and
stock had been issued in units in an eq
uity receivership in 1919. During the
proceeding, members of the family
which controlled the debtor made a

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
tender offer to the investors for both
their debt and equity securities at a
price approximately twice that which the
same investors had accepted under the
debtor's abortive Chapter XI plan of ar
rangement. The tender offer was suc
cessful.
The debtor's controlling persons then
moved to dismiss the Chapter X pro
ceeding on the ground that they owned
more than 88 percent in amount of the
debtor's outstanding debentures, the
debtor's only liabilities, and more than
96 percent of the debentures for which
proofs of claim had been filed. They
argued that they could reach an accord
with the remaining debenture holders
without court assistance, including, If
necessary,payment in full.
The Cornrnissron urged the court to
deny the motion to dismiss and to di
rect the trustee to conduct a thorough
investigation under Section 167 into the
debtor's affairs and to procure an inde
pendent appraisal of its property in
order to determine the fairness of the
price paid the investors. The court de
nied the motion to dismiss and author
ized the investigation and the appraisal.
It stated that, while the Commission
could certainly make the investigation
itself, the Chapter X court, once having
taken jurisdiction, should continue to go
forward in order to render complete
justice.25 Thereafter, the trustee, as
sisted by the staff of the Commission,
began an active and thorough Section
167 examination and retained independ
ent appraisers. At the close of the fiscal
year, the investigation and appraisal
were contlnuing,
Webb & Knapp, Inc.26 The Supreme
Court held in a 5 to 4 decision, that the

alleged negligent or Willful failure to
prevent the debtor's violation of protec
tive covenants in the indenture. The
majority of the court held that the exist

119

ing law did not provide for such an ac
tion, and that whether it would be wise
to confer such standing on a Chapter X
trustee is a policy decision which must
be left to Congress.
The motion was opposed by the
trustee and the Commission. The Com
mission urged that (1) the record left
doubt as to the adequacy of the disclo
sures to the public Investors and the
fairness of the price paid; (2) purchases
under the tender offer might have VIO
lated Rule 10b-5 under the Securities
Exchange Act; (3) the persons making
the tender offer had failed to file with
the Commission the statements required
by the Williams Act amendments to the
Exchange Act, thus rendering the ac
quisitions VOidable;and (4) no provision
of Chapter X was available to permit
such dismissal inasmuch as no plan
had been confirmed, creditors had not
received full payment, and no showing
had been made that a plan could not
be formulated.

to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth

lenging the jurisdiction of the district

bring the action. The court of appeals
held that the action might proceed on
condition that a representative of the

REPORTS
Generally, the Commission files a for
mal advisory report only in a case
which involves a substantial public
investor interest and presents signifi
cant problems. When no such formal re
port is filed the Commission may state
its views briefly by letter, or authorize
its counsel to make an oral or written
presentation.
During the fiscal year the Commis
sion published three formal advisory
reports 32 dealing with five plans and a
supplement to one report.33 Its views
on five other plans were transmitted to
the court either orally or by written
rnernoranda.sFour Seasons Nursing Centers of
America, Inc.35 This proceeding involved
a debtor engaged in the construction
and operation of a chain of nursing
homes whose ownership was shared be.
tween two ostensibly independent public
companies, with a maze of subsidiaries,
partnerships and corporations. This ar
rangement was designed to permit re
porting of large construction "profits"
by mtercompany sales which formed the
basis for a stock promotion. At the
peak, the outstanding shares were val
ued in the market at over $300 million,
but the operating nursing homes had
been seriously neglected and were pro
ducing substantial losses.
The trustee successfully brought the
nursing homes business to a profitable
level of operation, settled or tried con

troversies with creditors and co-owners,
and terminated the construction pro
gram. The trustee also faced litigation
against the debtors for alleged viola
tions of the anti-fraud provisions of the
Federal securities laws in the sale of
common stock. There were also pendmg
several class suits against the directors,
the underwriter and accountants, in
some of which suits the debtor compa
nies were joined as defendants.
The trustee's plan of reorganization
was based on consolidation of the debt
ors. The assets remaining in the estates
were valued at about $50 million. The
plan provided for payment in cash of
priority
obligations and
unsecured
claims of under $200, and the assump
tion of about $15 million of secured
debts by the reorganized company. Un
secured creditors, including $15 million
of Eurodollar debentures, were to re
ceive two-thirds of the new shares at
the rate of one share for each $7 of
claim. The remaining one-third were to
be distributed to the fraud claimants,
mostly former shareholders, in propor
tion to their losses. Losseswere defined
as the cost of securities purchased prior
to July 22, 1970, the date of the Chap
ter X proceeding, less any amount real
ized on resale. Claims for fraud filed in
the proceeding totaled over $110 mil
lion.
In its advisory report, the Commis
sion found the plan feasible, and con
cluded it was fair and equitable in most
respects. After reviewing the history and
interrelation among the various debtors,
subsidiaries and
partnerships, the
Commission found that they must be
treated as a single enterprise, as pro
posed by the plan. It also concluded
that the proposed settlement of the
fraud claims was reasonable.
The plan was amended, as urged by
the Commission, to provide for the first
election of directors in November 1972,
rather than May 1974, but the court did
not adopt the Commission's recommen
dation for a charter amendment to re

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
quire cumulative voting. As amended,
the plan was approved. An order of con
firmation was entered July 17, 1972,
about two years after the proceeding
began. Three notices of appeal have
been filed from the order of approval,
directed primarily at the settlement of
the fraud claims. Two complain that the
settlement was excessive, and one that
it was inadequate. As of the close of
the fiscal year these appeals were pend
ing.
Yale Express System, Inc.36 A motor
freight carrier was reorganized in this
proceeding. The trustee's plan provided
for satisfaction of all creditor claims, in
cluding post-bankruptcy interest, primar
ily in common stock of the reorganized
company. Secured creditors would re
ceive partial payment in notes, secured
by a mortgage on the debtor's building
in New York City, and in cash. Since
the value of the assets exceeded liabili
ties, the debtor's common shareholders
also were to receive a portion of the
new stock. The Commission urged that
the plan be amended to provide for
pre-emptive rights to the new sharehold
ers, to prevent future dilution of their
interests, and to provide for cumulative
voting in the election of directors.
The trustee amended the plan, but
qualified the pre-emptive rights provi
sion by adding, inter alia, a general ex
ception for all convertible securities
which might be issued in the future by
the reorganized company. Without such
exception, pre-emptive rights would bar
the company from issuing convertible
securities unless first offered to the
shareholders. On the Commission's
objection, the plan was further modified
to eliminate this exception.37
The trustee's plan originally provided
for allowance of post-bankruptcy inter
est at the contract rates to holders of
interest-bearing obligations and at 4%
percent to creditors whose debts did
not specify an interest rate. The trustee
subsequently acknowledged the inade
quacy of 4% percent, and proposed to

121

apply the prime rate of interest. The
Commission found neither rate appropri
ate, and urged that interest rates fixed
by state law should be applied to debts
for which no contractual rate was speci
fied. The district court held that the
post-bankruptcy interest rate is subject
to [udlcral discretion and allowed 61/2
percent.
A merchandise creditor claimed that
the plan should have granted prionty to
vendors who supplied goods and serv
ices necessary to the opration of the
debtor's business Within SIX months prior
to the commencement of the proceeding.
The bulk of the trade creditors, With
claims aggregating about $3.3 million,
would have fallen Within this class. The
Commission opposed thrs priority claim.
The priority was based on the "six
months rule," an equitable doctrine first
developed in railroad receiverships, and
designed to ensure the contmued opera
tion of public utilities. The Cornrnissron
pointed out that Congress had codified
the six-months rule in ~77 of the Bank
ruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. ~208), which
deals with railroad reorganization, but
deliberately omitted the rule from Chap
ter X. Although regulated in some reo
spects, a motor carrier does not enjoy
exclusive rights to serve a geographical
area, so that the continuation of its op
erations is not a matter of public neces
sity. The Commission urged that appli
cation of the "six-months" rule to
single out one group of general unse
cured creditors for favored treatment at
the expense of the other creditors with
the same legal status, such as the pub
lic investors who hold the debtor's de
bentures, was contrary to the basic pol
icy of equality which the Bankruptcy Act
embodied. The court agreed with the
views of the Commission.
Although not all of the recommenda
tions made by the Commission were ac
cepted by the court, it characterized the
Commission's advisory reports at the
last hearing on the plan as .. . . . ex

" After the close of the fiscal
year, the plan was approved by the district court.
Imperial '400' National, Inc.38 The
district court judge referred to the Commission three plans sponsored by outside proponents for the reorganization
of the debtor, a motel chain. Shortly
after the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission
issued
an
Advisory
Report 39 in which it found the total
value of Imperial to be about $20.5 million, including $8.2 million of unaffected
debt. This value gave an equity to the
debtor's former stockholders.
A group wishing to invest in the reorganized enterprise proposed two of the
plans. The original plan called for the
issuance of three classes of stock, two
of which included complex conversion
features; three series of warrants, each
with varying terms; and a secured convertible loan. The alternative plan, containing several options, called for the ISsuance of convertible preferred stock,
or cash at a heavy discount, and a
small issue of warrants. Each plan
would have given the proponent control
for a nominal cash investment, while
the debtor's creditors and stockholders
would have received an inadequate allocation of the value of the reorganized
company in exchange for their claims.
The commission advised the court
that both plans were unfeasible and
patently inequitable, and that the inordinately complex capital structures which
they proposed were contrary to the intent of Chapter X.
The third plan involved the formation
of a holding company which would own
all of the stock of the debtor and of a
construction company whose stock was
owned by the proponents. The Commission advised the court that this plan
was feasible but unfair with respect to
the amount of holding company stock
allocated for creditors and stockholders
of the debtor.
Shortly after the Comrnissron submitted its report, several new plans of reor-

ganization were filed with the court, offering substantially better terms.
American National Trust and Republic
National Trust.39a A plan of reorganization has been approved by the district
court. Under the plan, the debtors,
which are real estate investment trusts,
will be combined into a single company
owning rental real estate valued at approximately $15 million. The properties
are encumbered by mortgage indebtedness of about $11 million, which the reorganized company will assume. Other
creditors are to be paid in full. The public investors who own the shares of the
old trusts will become owners of the equity in the new company by exchanging
their old shares on a share-for-share
basis.
The Commission considered the plan
to be feasible and to be fair and equitable in most respects. It took the position that the disputed claims of certain
former shareholders must either be litigated or compromised as a class under
the plan. These former shareholders
had asserted that the debtors were
culpable participants in a scheme
whereby a trustee of the debtors, following his resignation as trustee, obtained from the public some $600,000
of trust shares in exchange for his
worthless notes. About half of the
shares so acqurred were returned to the
debtors in connection with abortive real
estate transactions. The balance were
resold by him and the proceeds squandered. Although the trustee denied liability, the plan was amended to offer
the class Victims, as a compromise, one
new share for each two shares lost by
them in the transaction with this former
trustee. This offer has been accepted by
the necessarymajority of the class.

In its memorandum the Commission

plan should be deferred because, in
view of the debtor's past and continuing
losses, there was no adequate basis
from which to project future earnings.

Manufacturers' Credit Corporation.41
The proceedings demonstrated that the
financial condition of the parent and its
25 affiliates and subsidiaries was hope
less and that an internal reorganization
was not possible. However, with finan
cial assistance from the State of New
Jersey, the trustee was able to propose
a plan of liquidation calling for the sale
of all the debtors' assets to another bus
company that serves adjacent routes
and thereby preserve bus transportation
for the communities served by the debt
ors. But, since the sale would not yield
enough to cover secured claims, public
holders of unsecured notes would not
share in the proceeds of sale. The plan
was submitted to the Commission,
which advised the court that the exclu
sion of the public investors was in ac
cord with the standards of Chapter X.
Webb & Knapp, Inc.42 The trustee's
plan of reorganization, approved by the
court, provides for an orderly liquida
tion. The most important feature was a
settlement of disputed Federal tax
claims of some $36 million for
$2,750,000 in cash. The tax dispute
was based on a claim that profits made
in the early years were ordinary income
rather than capital gains. Other priority
claims and administrative expenses are
also to be paid in cash and any balance
remaining distributed pro rata to unse
cured creditors, including the debenture
holders. The debtor being insolvent, pre.
ferred and common shareholders are
excluded from participation.
Maryva/e Community Hospital, Inc.43
The court of appeals affirmed the order

123

approving the plan of reorganization.44
The plan was based on a sale of the
debtor's property and distribution of the
proceeds to the bondholders, the debt
or's only creditors. The debtor was a
nonprofrt corporation and the Attorney
General of Anzona had intervened to as
sert a right to any surplus remaining
after satisfaction of the rights of the
bondholders. The court of appeals
agreed with the trustee and the Com
mission that the bondholders were enti
tled to post-bankruptcy interest as well
as interest on interest, as specified in
the indenture. The Commission and the
Attorney General had objected to allow
ance of a call premium but the court of
appeals did not decide this Issue, since
it found that the other items allowed
would exhaust the fund.
Phoenix Gems, Inc.45 This case in.
volved a debtor engaged in the formula
tion, production, marketing and sale of
various low toxic insecticides. It had
outstanding about 2.3 million shares of
common stock. In 1969, the company
underwent a Chapter XI arrangement
which was substantially consummated.
However,that arrangement did not cure
the debtor's fmancial ills which contin
ued and led to the filing of a Chapter X
petition. Since its tlabihtres were less
than $250,000, the debtor remained in
possession.
A plan of reorganization was pro
posed by proponents who owned a
small company in a parallel line of busi
ness. It contemplated the acquisition of
that enterprise by the debtor and the is
suance of more than 18 million shares
of the reorganized company, 80 percent
for all of the shares of the proponents'
company and 20 percent for the claims
and interest in the debtor.
The staff of the Commission stated
that the number of shares to be issued,
20 percent of which would be publicly
traded, was not justified by the modest
assets of the reorganized company. The
plan was amended to reduce the nurn
ber of shares to about 1.8 million.

ing in the receivership was covered by
the bar of Section 249.54
The other applicant had also traded,
but he had done so after substantial
consummation of the plan. The trustee
urged that such trading nevertheless re
qurred denial of compensation. The
Commission advised the court that
there was no need to reach this issue
since the applicant had failed to show
that he had performed compensable
services,and the court agreed.
Imperial '400' National, Inc.55 The
court of appeals had reversed, as exces
sive, the third interim allowance to the
trustee and his counsel.56 On remand,
the district court reduced the allowance
to the maximums indicated by the court
of appeals and ordered refund of the
excess payments. The successful appel
lant urged that payment of interest on
the refunds should be required. The dis
trict judge ordered that one applicant,
who had invested and earned interest
on his allowance, pay the earnings to
the estate, but did not require the pay
ment of interest on funds not profitably
invested. An appeal followed.
The Commission had suggested that
decision on this relatively small matter
be deferred until final allowances were
granted and the equities arising from
the overpayment be adjusted in that
context, and it adhered to that position
in the appeal. The court held, however,
that the applicants should pay interest
on the refund. It fixed the rate at that
earned by the estate on its surplus
funds during the period they held the
money.57
Bermec Corp.58 Attorneys for the

terim allowance of $65,000. The appli
cation included the time spent on es
tate
matters
by
lawyers
and
para-professionals. The latter are not
lawyers, but render routine services
which junior attorneys of the firm would
otherwise have to perform. The Com
mission urged that their services be
treated as profesional services, and
recommended $30,000 as adequate in
terim compensation, since the time
spent was weighted so heavily by the
work of the para-professionals.
The referee as special master recom
mended $51,265 of which $10,000 was
allotted as overhead expense for the
para-professionals' service. He stated in
his report that he could not allow fees
for these services because such "help
should be included 10 overhead just as
is secretarial assistance or summer law
students." The district judge allowed
the amount recommended by the spe
cial master, without discussmg the sta
tus of the para-professionals. The Com
mission continues to adhere to its
reviews on this subject.

INTERVENTION

IN

CHAPTER

XI

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act pro
vides a procedure by which debtors can
effect arrangements with respect to
their unsecured debts under court su
pervision. Where a proceeding is
brought under that chapter but the
facts indicate that it should have been
brought under Chapter X, Section 328
of Chapter XI authorizes the Commis
sion or any other party in interest to
make application to the court to dis
miss the Chapter XI proceeding unless
the debtor's petition is amended to
comply with the requirements of Chap
ter X, or a creditors' petition under
Chapter X is filed.
Attempts are sometimes made to
misuse Chapter XI so as to deprive
investors of the protections which the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securi
ties ExchangeAct of 1934 are designed
to provide.59 In such cases the Commis

sion's staff normally attempts to resolve
the problem by informal negotiations. If
this proves fruitless, the Commission in
tervenes in the Chapter XI proceeding
to develop an adequate record and to
direct the court's attention to the appli
cable provisions of the Federal securi
ties laws and their bearing on the par.
ticular case.50
Synergistics, Inc.51 The Commission
intervened because of questions regard
ing the viability of the debtor's busi
ness. Its main concern was the pro
posed issuance of
an
additional
800,000 shares of common stock, in
addition to over 1 million shares pre
viously issued and outstanding. Very lit
tle information about the debtor was
available to the investing public and
there was the possibility that a specula.
tive market in the debtor's shares would
develop.
The Commission's objections to the
arrangement were withdrawn when cer
tain amendments were proposed. These
included voluntary registration of the
debtor's common stock under Section
12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act,
and a commitment that all of the
800,000 shares to be issued to its cred
itors would be restncted for two years
from confirmation, after which the
debtor would use its best efforts to reg
ister such shares under the Securities
Act. The referee confirmed the arrange
ment. His order of confirmation in
cluded the following statement: "The in
tervention
of
the
Securities and
Exchange Commission in Chapter XI
proceedings ... is at one with the duty
of a Chapter XI court ... to make sure
that it does not confirm a Plan that
aids creditors in foisting stock of highly
doubtful value on an unsuspecting pub
lic, the members of which may believe
that the order confirming the Plan gives
a validity to the issued stock beyond its
real worth."
Space City, USA, Inc.52 The debtor
filed a Chapter X petition and was sub
sequently adjudicated a bankrupt when

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
it proved impossible to reorganize. After
three years in bankruptcy, the debtor
filed a Chapter XI petition. Though a
mere corporate shell, it filed a plan of
arrangement providing for the issuance
of about 2.5 million shares. The Com
mission intervened in order to prevent
the issuance of a large quantity of
worthless securities, pointing out that
the use of Chapter XI for the purpose
of reactivating trading interest in a dor
mant shell was improper. The district
court dismissed the Chapter XI proceed
ing.
A-T Industries, Inc.63 This company
began as a thrift and securities institu
tion which issued approximately $3.2
million of debentures to the public
years ago. In later years it was con
verted into an operating company, with
several small businesses. Although it
made a modest operating profit, it had
lost a large part of its capital on un
sound investments. On default in pay
ment of interest, it filed a Chapter XI
petition.
The proposed arrangement provided
that the debenture holders would re
ceive $1.6 million of new lO-year de
bentures issued by the debtor's bowling
alley subsidiary, $1.6 million of the
debtor's new preferred stock, and 50
percent of the debtor's common stock.
The debtor would guarantee payment of
the subsidiary debentures at maturity.
Available cash would be used to pay
management its back bonuses. The
debtor could not hope to pay preferred
dividends and coverage of the deben
ture interest was doubtful.
The Commission indicated that it
would file a motion under Section 328
of Chapter XI to have the proceeding
transferred to Chapter X. Thereafter, the
staff, at the request of the Referee, con
ferred with other parties. As a result the
proposed arrangement was amended to
create approximately $2 million of new
notes, secured by a pledge of the prin
cipal assets of the debtor and subject
to appropriate sinking fund require

127

ments. The preferred stock was elimi
nated and the debenture holders re
ceived 90 percent (instead of
50
percent) of the debtor's common stock.
Management received stock rather than
cash for their back bonuses. In view of
the amendment, the need of the deben
ture holders for Chapter X seemed less
clear, and the Commission determined
not to proceed under Section 328.
Capital Cities Nursmg Centres, Inc.64
The debtor had made an offering of se
curities, representing that unless all the
shares were sold, any funds subscribed
would be returned to investors. Al
though debtor raised only $1.9 million
of the $4.5 million sought, it spent the
funds received and was unable to return
them. The Cornmlssion brought a civil
action under the securities laws, and
the Federal Court in New York ap
pointed a trustee on the Commission's
motion.65 Two weeks later, the debtor
filed its voluntary Chapter XI proceeding
in New Jersey, and asserted that this
proceeding ousted the
New York
trustee. The New Jersey court overruled
a motion to dismiss the Chapter XI pro
ceeding as having been filed in bad
faith, but appointed its own receiver.
Subsequently, an understanding was
reached. It allowed the Chapter XI re
ceiver to utilize current cash flow from
the debtor for current operations and
permitted the trustee in the civil action
to seek an accounting from the individ
ual defendants for the funds they had
diverted. The Chapter XI receiver or the
trustee were to retain any funds each
received from the defendants pending a
later determination of the proper dispo
sition.
Posi-Seal International,
Inc.66 The
debtor had outstanding about 4.9 mil
lion shares held by the public. The ar
rangement provided, inter alia, that
after a one-for-ten reversesplit, new
shares would be distributed in specified
proportions, including 25 percent to the
present stockholders and a like percent
age to the holders of the debtor's de

128

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

bentures, which apparently were not
publicly held. The corporate charter was
also to be amended to decrease the
amount of authorized shares and to
eliminated the authority to issue pre
ferred stock. All of these charter
amendments required consent of stock
holders under state law and the ar
rangement specified that such consent
was a condition precedent to consum
mation of the plan.
The referee confirmed the plan. A
stockholder filed a petition for review, In
which he objected to the jurisdiction of
the court to confirm the arrangement.
contending that (1) Chapter XI does not
permit a stock recapitalization of the
debtor as provided for in the arrange
ment, and (2) Chapter X, not Chapter
XI, is the proper avenue of relief if
rights of stockholders are thus adjusted.
The district judge affirmed the referee's
order and the stockholder appealed.
At the request of the court of ap
peals, the Commission filed a brief ami
cus curiae, in support of the jurisdiction
of the Chapter XI court. The Commis
sion viewed the plan as a composition
with unsecured creditors, which could
properly be implemented by the recapi
talization in accordance with the re
quirements of state law. The Commis
sion
also
concluded
that
the
circumstances in this proceeding did
not indicate the need for the safeguards
of Chapter X. The court of appeals
agreed with the Commission and af
firmed the order below.67

In re TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc., 334 F. 2d
118 (C.A. 5, 1964), in which it was held
that there was no rule of law precluding
employment of the trustee. The court
noted, however, that proof that the
trustee was offered "emoluments and
security" rather than a mere nomina
tion, would disqualify him. In a later
phase of the TMT proceeding the Su
preme Court granted certiorari on this
issue among others (387 U.S. 929

versed the orders appealed from on
other grounds, and stated "finally, there
is no necessity to determine whether it
was improper to contemplate making the
trustee president of the reorganized com.
pany" (p. 453) because of mootness.
Three Justices dissented, saying:
" ... the only question which could
be thought even remotely to justify
the presence of this case in this
court is whether the trustee, by
virtue of his office, was as a mat.
ter of law disqualified from being
elected as president of the reorganized company." (p, 454).
The dissenters felt that failure to decide

a vote of stockholders specifically

PART 8

s. E. C.

MANAGEMENT
OPERATIONS
REORGANIZATION
The first major reorganization of the
Commission's structure In thirty years
became effective on August 7, 1972.
The Commission now has five operating
divisions instead of three. The Division
of Trading and Markets was divided into
a Division of Enforcement and a Division of Market Regulation. A new Divrsion of Investment Company Regulation
was spun off from the Division of Corporate Regulation. Investment Company
disclosure activity was transferred to
the Division of Corporation Finance and
all enforcement activities were concentrated in the new Division of Enforcement. Thus, the major elements in the
reorganization were the concentration of

all investigative and enforcement activity in a single divrsron, the focusing of
all disclosure activity in a single division, and the creation of two regulatory
divisions, one for broker-dealers and
markets and the other for Investment
companies. Public-utility holding company and bankruptcy and reorganization
functions remain in the Division of Corporate Regulation.
A more detailed description of the reorganization appears In Part 1 of this
report.

OTHER CHANGES
Executive Director
The position of Executive Director
was reestablished by the Commission in

133
488-483 0 - 73 - 11

134

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

a move which had broad impact on the
day-to-day operation of the agency. In
creased public financing, intensified
market activity, new responsibilities im
posed by Congress, and mounting prob
lems in the securities industry required
the concentration of executive and ad
ministrative functions in an executive
position reporting directly to the Chair
man.
As the chief operating official of the
Commission, the Executive Director ex
ercises administrative and management
direction over all divisions and offices
except for three units directly assisting
the Commission. The reestablishment of
the position of Executive Director repre
sents the beginning of a management
structure designed to provide executive
direction and control, alternative pro
gram approaches to meet policy goals,
and improved operating systems.
During the year, the Office of the Ex
ecutive Director was strengthened to as
sist in improving communications and
internal procedures and in the review
and appraisal of internal compliance
with the Commission's policies, plans
and procedures.
The Executive Director's Report was
instituted in February, 1972. The report
is a comprehensive management tool
containing data with respect to major
workload and cost items, significant
events, industry operations and progress
on rules, regulations, and other Com
mission projects. The report is distrib
uted to the Commissioners and all divi
sion and office heads and regional
offices.
In addition, the Executive Director,
along with the Division and Office
Heads, assumed an active role in the
budget process, using the budget as a
key management tool in establishing
priorities and allocating resources.

Office of Public Information
The Office of Public Information was
established with a professional inforrna
tion staff to fully implement the Com

mission's role as an agency of disclo
sure by bringing SEC information to the
investing public, the securities industry
and the corporations in an active, com
prehensive,clear manner.
The Office of Public Information is re
sponsible for seeing that the purpose of
corporate and regulated industry disclo
sure is fulfilled by devising programs
that effectively bring this information to
the investing public. The Office develops
programs to highlight what is most sig
nificant in disclosure and works with the
communications industry to achieve
maximum dissemination of this informa
tion through the financial press, com
mercial reporting services, microfilm fa
cilities, securities industry, corporate
and investor organizations, SEC Public
Reference Rooms and investor educa
tion programs.
The Office of Public Information also
shares with operating divisions the re
sponsibility for seeing that the corpora
tions, regulated industries and profes
sions that serve them understand the
alms and requirements of SEC disclo
sure. As the communications arm of the
Commission, the Public Information
Office also provides professional writing
and other vital communications support.

Others
The Office of Chief Financial Analyst
was established in the Division of Cor.
poration Finance to provide uniformity
of comment and disclosure in compara
ble situations, as well as to anticipate
trends in the business community which
may present particular disclosure prob
lems that could require Commission ac
tion.
The Industry
Operations Technical
Staff was established in the Division of
Market Regulation (formerly part of the
Division of Trading and Markets) to pre
pare for the elimination or immobiliza
tion of the stock certificate; to assure
an orderly transition from procedures
that rely heavily upon stock certificates
to one that will rely principally upon

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
computer records; to recommend new
rules to be promulgated by the Commis
sion and/or the self-regulatory bodies;
and to draft proposed legislation as
appropriate.
The Office of Broker-Dealer Examina
tions was established in the Division of
Market Regulation (formerly part of the
Division of Trading and Markets) to di
rect and coordinate an accelerated na
tionwide program of broker-dealer and
investment adviser examinations. This
intensive approach includes develop
ment of examination policies, recom
mendation of new rules and regulations
relating to the program, training of new
examination personnel and coordination
of multiregional examinations involving
the states and the self-regulatory orga
nizations.
A branch of the Washington, D.C. Re
gional Office was established to serve
the investing public in Philadelphia, the
Nation's fourth largest city.

OMS STUDY
Early in the fiscal year the Office of
Management and Budget conducted a
management review of the Commis
sion's operations. The OMB report con
firmed the Commission's view that the
agency had run down in numbers and
strength and had not kept up with the
Increased workload it had been called
upon to handle. The report pointed out
that increased securities activity had far
outstripped authorized manpower and
money resources. The report also rec
ommended increased oversight of the
self-regulatory agencies and pointed out
that the Commission had fallen behind
in inspections, investigations and en
forcement responsibility, and particu
larly in keeping up with its obligations
under the Public Utility Holding Com
pany Act and the Bankruptcy Act. As a
positive recommendation, OMB urged a
greater effort to take the lead in antici
pating problems and to base this en
deavor on more extended economic and
policy research. The report also recom

135

mended additional management support
and the establishment of a public
inforrnatron faculty. Many of the de
tailed recommendations already have
been implemented, and the Commission
is giving continuing attention to staffing,
operational methods and policies in its
major areas of responsibility.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
In the 1972 fiscal year, the Congres
sional appropriation to the Commission
was $26.8 million, of which $19.1 mil
lion was offset by fees collected by the
Commission, or 71 percent of appropri
ation. The net cost of SEC operations
was $7.7 million.
All fees collected by the Commission
are deposited into the Treasury as mis
cellaneous receipts. The Commission is
required by law to collect fees for (1)
registration of securities issued; (2)
qualiftcation of trust indentures; (3) reg
istration of exchanges; (4) brokers and
dealers who are registered with the
Commission but who are not members
of a registered national securities asso
cratlon: and (5) certification of docu
ments filed with the Cornrnlssron.
Effective March I, 1972, the Commis
sion adopted a fee schedule under the
Securities Act of 1933, the Securities
ExchangeAct of 1934, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, the In
vestment Company Act of 1940 and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Fees
are now charged for certain filings and
services under those Acts where no
charges had previously been made.
Such fees are not refundable.
In fiscal 1972, these charges pro
duced $2.3 million in additional reve
nues. For fiscal 1973, an estimated $5.3
million will be produced.

PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT
Recruiting
Due to severe budgetary limitations,
the Commission adhered to a general
hiring freeze during the first six months

136

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

of fiscal 1972. However, with the approval of a supplemental appropriation
late in December, 1971, funds became
available to permit the Commission to
generally resume hiring and to increase
its ceiling for permanent employees by
146, from 1,416 to 1,562. Since actual
employment at that time was only
1,356, it was necessary to launch an intensive effort to recruit more than 300
people to fill the 60 then existing vacancies, the 146 new jobs, and the approximately 120 positions which became
vacant due to turnover between December, 1971, and June, 1972.
Altogether the Commission filled 163
professional and 152 technical or clerical positions, in all grade levels from
G8-1 through G8-18, and in virtually
every one of its existing job categories.
Appointments were made in a wide
range of grades and occupations, drawing upon persons employed in the private sector as well as in Federal and
State agencies. The Commission was
able to attract to its staff a number of
top-flight people with significant and
substantial experience in the securities
industry, including several from self-regulatory bodies such as the New York
Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, and state
securities commissions. Most of the experienced
accountants
hired
were
CPA's with work experience in prominent national accounting firms. The
Commission also hired a significant
number of recent college graduates, inclUding some With graduate degrees, for
starting level positions of Accountant,
Financial Analyst and Investigator.
In summary, in substantially increasing its permanent staff in fiscal 1972,
the Commission was able to attract a
good mix of recent college and law
school graduates with high academic
achievement, and individuals with diversified and high quality experience in the
field of securities and finance, including
a number of minority group persons
and women.

In order to accommodate the additional staff, about 23,000 square feet of
office space was acquired at 1100 L
Street NW. The Offices of Hearing Examiners, Opinions and Review, and Policy Research, as well as the Branches
of Public Utility Regulation and Reorganization, were moved to that location.
The followlng table shows the permanent personnel strength of the Commission as of June 30, 1972.

Reduction in Average Grade
In launching its recruitment program,
the Commission had to bear in mind
the Office of Management and Budget's
instructions to Federal agencies to reduce their average grades. The Commission's assigned objective was a reduction of 0.15 by June 30, 1972, and
0.30 by June 3D, 1973. Despite the fact
that a significant number of the additions to the staff were experienced persons appointed in the mid-level (G8-9
through G8-12) and senior level (G8-13
through G8-15) grades, the total average grade reduction that was targeted
to be reached at the end of fiscal year
1973 was achieved in fiscal 1972.

Service and Merit Awards
The Commission's Seventeenth Annual Service and Merit Awards Program
was held in November, 1971. Distinguished Service Medals were awarded
by the Commission to Gerald E. Boltz,
then Regional Administrator of the Fort
Worth Regional Office (now Regional Ad-

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT
ministrator in Los Angeles); Arthur A.
Pennekamp, Regional Administrator of
the San Francisco Regional Office (now
retired); Sheldon Rappaport, Associate
Director, Division of Market Regulation;
Charles J. Sheppe, Chief of the Branch
of Forms, Regulations and Legislative
Matters, Division of Corporation Finance
(now retired); and Stanley Sporkin, As
sociate Director, Division of Enforce
ment. Eight employees were given 35
year SEC service awards; 12 employees
received awards for 30 years of SEC
service. Within-grade salary increases in
recognition of high quality performance
were granted to 19 employees; and
cash awards totaling $7,950 were pre
sented to 39 employees for superior
performance, or special service.

Training and Development
The Office of Personnel, with the help
of the various Divisions and Offices, de
signed and is about to launch a new
professional employee orientation pro
gram. The program consists of presen
tations by each of the major operating
divisions and by other key staff and
service offices. It is intended to reduce
the time it takes a new staff member to
become familiar with the intricacies of
the agency, thus making the new em
ployee more productive at an earlier
date.
A revised Executive Development Pro
gram was adopted in April, 1972, and
incorporated into the Agency's Manual
of Administrative Regulations. The pur
pose of this program is to identify and
develop employees occupying positions
in Grades GS-13, 14, and 15, who are
regarded by their superiors as having
high potential to fill executive positions
in GradesG5-16, 17 and 18.
The Fifth Annual Enforcement School
conducted by the Division of Trading
and Markets was held in June, 1972,
with over 100 participants from both in
side and outside the Commission.
In January, 1972, the Division of Cor

137

porate Regulation conducted a weeklong training session on the Investment
Company Act in Los Angeles. In attend
ance were staff members from Los Am
geles, Forth Worth, and Seattle as well
as representatives of the California De
partment of Corporations and the
NASD. In addition, a training program
covering the amendments to the Invest
ment Company Act was held in Denver.
Development of a series of proce
dural manuals was begun in fiscal
1972. The Broker-Dealer Inspection
Manual was completed and issued for
staff use in April, 1972. The Investment
Adviser Inspection Manual was com
pleted and Issued for staff use shortly
after the end of the fiscal year. A final
draft of the Enforcement Manual was
under review at the year's end, and an
outline of the Investment Company
Inspection Manual was completed and
work was in progress at the year's end.

New Classification Standard for
Investigator Positions
The Commission received Civil Serv
ice Commission approval for the estab
lishment of a single-agency position
classification standard for inspector (in
vestigator) type positions. The govern
ment-wide standard issued recently by
the Civrl Service Commission was inap
propriate because it placed too much
emphasis on investigators involved with
so-called "street" crimes as opposed to
the "white-collar" violations with which
the SEC must deal. The Commission's
investigative and enforcement program
was identified as being sufficiently
unique to warrant establishment of a
new standard applicable to the SEC
only. With the accompanying title of Se
curities Compliance Examiner primarily
for those engaged in broker-dealer, in
vestment adviser, and investment com
pany inspections, the special title and
job standard should enhance the pres
tige and status of those staff members
involved in all inspection programs.

138

SECURITIESAND EXCHANGECOMMISSION

Position Management and Control
A formal position management sys
tem was established in November,
1971, resulting in an improved manage
ment control in creating new positions
or in filling vacancies in existing jobs.
Also, promotions are now funded and
planned on a selective and priority
basis.

ELECTRONIC DATA

PROCESSING

During the 1972 fiscal year, the Com
mission increased its efforts to further
apply electronic data processing tech
nology to its information systems.
A new system developed involves the
creation of a data base covering infor
mation derived from holdings and trans
action reports of corporate insiders. The
system is designed to reduce late re
porting and failure to report; utilize
these reports systematically to verify
share balances and detect liabilities for
short-swing trading profits; assist in the
enforcement of antifraud provisions;
permit wider and more detailed public
dissemination of insider trading infor
mation; and aid in the compilation of
data for statistical and policy planning
purposes.
Another project developed in fiscal
year 1972 and currently being imple
mented in a delinquency reporting sys
tem involving Forms 1Q-K (Annual Re
port), 1D-Q (Quarterly Report), and
Forms N-1Q and N-1R (Investment
Company reports). The purposes of the
system are to assist in enforcement of
timely reporting requirements; respond
to inquiries from the public, staff mem
bers and other interested persons con
cerning specrflc reports and issuers; and
end the lengthy manual reviews which
have been necessaryin the past.

The CUSIP numbering system, a
method of identifying and describing se
curities which was developed by the
Committee on Uniform Security Identifi
cation Procedures of the American
Bankers Association, was instituted dur
ing the past year. In addition to the
computer programs needed to crossreference CUSIP data with Commission
data files, programs and procedures
were developed to provide for the man
ual and automated update and mainte
nance of the basic file.
In addition to these standing sys
tems, the Commission also developed
computer programs and produced spe
cific outputs for several special, one
time projects. One of these involved the
collection and analysis of data concern
ing certain oil and gas programs for use
in drafting proposed legislation affecting
such programs. Another project involved
the creation of a computer file
consisting of data collected through an
Investment Company Brokerage Com
mission Questionnaire. Reports gener
ated from this data file assisted the
staff in assessing the effect on regis
tered investment companies of the elim
ination of minimum commission rates
on portions of orders in excess of
$500,000.
EDP applications currently under de
velopment include a system for process
ing data reported on Form 144, the
form used for notice of proposed sales
pursuant to the recently adopted Rule
144 under the Securities Act of 1933.
Preliminary systems work was also
begun late in fiscal year 1972, to deter
mine the feasibility and probable design
of an automated information and early
warning system pertaining to financial
and operational difficulties of brokerdealer and investment adviser firms.

cents. The two largest components of
expenses were registered representa
tives' compensation, 19 cents per dollar,
and clerical and administrative employee

Registered

Broker-Dealers

During fiscal year 1972, there was a
further net decline of 206 in the num
ber of broker-dealers registered with the
Commission, to 4,734. This decline re
sulted primarily from the withdrawal of
688 broker-dealer registrations in the
course of the year. Since fiscal 1970,
the net decline has totalled 490. How
ever, the number of registered firms at
the end of the past year was still sub
stantially higher than that at the end of
fiscal 1967, when the number of regis
tered broker-dealers was only 4,175, the
lowest number since 1954.
About one-fourth of all firms regis

REGISTERED

Number

tered at the end of fiscal 1972 had their
principal office in New York City. Another
413 firms maintained their principal
office in other locations in New York
State. California, with 483, accounted
for the next highest numbers of firms,
followed by New Jersey, with 234, and
Pennsylvania, with 215. About 70 per
cent of the registered broker-dealers
were organized as corporations. Of the
remainder, the majority were sole pro
prietorships, with partnerships the least
common form of organization. By way of
comparison, at the end of fiscal 1968,
only about 54 percent of the registered
broker-dealers were corporations.

Investment

value of $80.8 billion, with mutual funds
accounting for about 80 percent of that
value. The $80.8 billion figure represents the highest fiscal year-end figure
since the Investment Company Act was
passed in 1940. An appreciation of the
tremendous growth of the investment
company industry in the intervening period may be gained by noting that in
1950 there were 366 investment companies with total assets of about $4.7
billion, and that as recently as 1960,
there were only 570 companies with
assets of $23.5 billion.

Companies

As of the end of the 1972 fiscal year,
1,334 investment companies were registered with the Commission, a decline of
17 from the number one year earlier.
Of the registered companies, 90 were
classified as "inactive." Approximately
65 percent of the active companies
were management open-end companies
("mutual funds").
The 1,244 active companies had total

Private Noninsured Pension Funds:
Book Value
Total assets of private noninsured
pension funds were $106.4 billion (book
value) at the end of 1971, almost 10
percent higher than 1970. While this
rate of growth exceeds the 7 percent

rise in 1970, it is less than the average
annual growth rate from 1960 to 1968
(12 percent). A total of $62.8 billion of
pension fund assets were invested in
common stock in 1971. This represents
about three-fifths of all assets versus
only about one-third held in common
stock in 1960.

THIRTf.EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT

stock Volume by Exchanges;
NASDAQ Volume
The NYSE share of all exchange Val.
ume rose slightly in 1971 to nearly 80
percent of share volume. AMEX share
volume was 18 percent of the total,
while AMEX dollar volume accounted for
10 percent of all exchange volume. For
both measures, this represented a slight
decline from the previous year. Of the
regional exchanges, the Midwest and
Pacific Coast Stock Exchanges had the
biggest volume, each exceeding 3 per-

cent of total share and dollar volume.
Since November 1, 1971,trading volume for a significant portion of the active over.theiounter market has been
compiled by the NASO's automated
quotations system (NASDAQ). For the
first six months of 1972, NASDAQ volume was 1.2 billion shares, equivalent to
56 percent of NYSE volume and 183
percent of AMEX volume. This trading
volume reflects the number of shares
bought and sold by market makers plus
the net inventory changes for market
makers.

Third Market Volume
During 1971, over-the-counter sales of
common stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange (the so-called "third
market") reached record levels in terms
of both share and dollar volume, Overthe-counter volume amounted to almost
298 million shares, valued at $12.4
billion, compared with 210 million

shares and $8 billion the previous year.
The increase in dollar volume represented the largest annual increase since
1965, when reports to the Commission
regarding third market transactions were
first required. Trading over-the-counter
in NYSE common stocks as a ratio to all
stock trading on the NYSE reached a
new high of 7.0 percent on a share
basis and 8.4 percent on a dollar basis,

The Commission declared effective a
record number of 3.712 registration

volume of filings nearly equaled the
record of 4,314 established in 1970. Included in this total were 1.371 statements by companies filing with the

THIRTY-EIGHTHANNUAL REPORT

Purpose of Registration
Securities registered for cash sale for
the account of the issuers aggregated
$49.9 billion in fiscal 1972. This was
$8.6 billion less than the record 1971
amount but $1.7 billion above the 1970
level. The decrease was primarily due
to a reduced volume of debt issues;
only $20.1 billion of bonds, debentures
and notes were registered for the account of the issuer during the year compared with the $27.6 billion in fiscal
1971. Securities registered for the account of the issuer for other than cash
sale, such as stock underlying a convertible issue, also declined in 1972.
However. the registrations of secondary
offerings (for the account of other than
the issuer) jumped 68 percent and
totaled $6.8 billion in 1972.

Registrations of immediate cash offerings amounted to $31.0 billion, down
sharply from the record $38.2 billion in
1971. All of this decline was attributable
to new debt offerings which fell nearly
$9 billion to $18.8 billion in 1972. New
flotations of common stock, however,
rose to a record $10.0 billion for the
year. Preferred stock registrations declined sharply from the record level of
1971. although these issues continue to
attract increasing attention as a means
of raising capital.
Registrations of extended offerings
amounted to $18.8 billion in fiscal 1972,
unchanged from a year earlier. The
larger part of this total consisted of
investment company shares, registrations of which rose slightly to $11.4
billion during the year.

THIRTY.EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table below reffects, the secur
ities laws provide for a wide range of
enforcement actions by the Commission.
The most common types of actions are
injunctive proceedings instituted in the
Federal district courts to enjoin con-

tinued or threatened securities law vlo
lators, and administrative proceedings
pertaining to broker-dealer firms and/or
individuals associated with such firms
which may lead to various remedial
sanctions as required in the public in.
terest. When an injunction is entered
by a court, violation of the court's
decree is a basis for criminal contempt
action against the violator.
