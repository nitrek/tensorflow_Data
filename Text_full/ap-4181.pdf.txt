In the Matter of
CURTIS A. PETERSON

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND DIRECTING THE PARTIES
TO HOLD AN INITIAL
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On August 23, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent. Based on the return receipt provided by the Office of the
Secretary, service of the OIP on Respondent appears to have occurred on August 26, 2016. On
September 12, 2016, Respondent filed an answer asserting a number of affirmative defenses. A
hearing is currently scheduled for September 29, 2016. On September 15, 2016, the Division of
Enforcement filed a motion to postpone the hearing and schedule a telephonic prehearing
conference.
I POSTPONE the hearing and direct the parties to hold an initial prehearing conference
without the hearing officer by October 3, 2016, to discuss each numbered item in Rule of
Practice 221(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c), including the date by which each item will be
accomplished. By October 7, 2016, the parties shall file a joint prehearing conference statement
which: (1) addresses each numbered item in Rule 221(c), including proposed due dates where
applicable (the parties may denote that an item is “not applicable” in their filing); (2) confirms
the date the OIP was served on Respondent in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141;
(3) indicates whether Respondent waives his right to a hearing between thirty and sixty days
after service of the OIP, see OIP at 6, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(b); (4) proposes a procedural schedule
that will result in a hearing commencing approximately four months after service of the OIP; and
(5) addresses the potential location and length of a hearing. Based on this statement, a
subsequent prehearing conference with the hearing officer will be scheduled if appropriate. If
the parties are unable to hold a prehearing conference by October 3, 2016, the Division shall
notify my office before that date.
The parties should email courtesy copies of any filings in this proceeding in PDF textsearchable format and, when possible, in Word format, to alj@sec.gov.
