In the Matter of
GroveWare Technologies Ltd.,
Luve Sports, Inc., and
Northcore Technologies, Inc.,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of GroveWare Technologies
Ltd. (CIK No. 1484931), a revoked Nevada corporation with its principal place of
business listed as Toronto, Ontario, Canada with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously,
“Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker
symbol GROV, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended March
31, 2013. On August 18, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of
Corporation Finance to GroveWare Technologies Ltd. requesting compliance with its
periodic filing obligations, but GroveWare Technologies Ltd. did not receive the
delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the
Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 CFR
232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of

August 18, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to
Luve Sports, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, but Luve
Sports, Inc. did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid
address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Northcore Technologies,
Inc. (CIK No. 1079171), an Ontario corporation with its principal place of business listed
as Toronto, Ontario, Canada with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol
NTLNF, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended December
31, 2012. On August 18, 2015, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of

periodic filing obligations, but Northcore Technologies, Inc. did not receive the
