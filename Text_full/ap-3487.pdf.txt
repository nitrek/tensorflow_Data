ORDER

:

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on
December 22, 2015, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on January 12, 2016. The OIP
alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has repeatedly failed to file
required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to revoke the registrations of
Respondents’ securities.
The OIP provides that each Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the
OIP on it. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). 1 A Respondent that fails to file an Answer within
the time provided will be deemed to be in default, and the undersigned will enter an order revoking
the registration of its securities. See OIP at 3-4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f). To allow time for
Answers, the hearing will be postponed sine die, and a prehearing conference will be held by
telephone on February 26, 2016, at 11:00 a.m. EST, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

1

Each Respondent other than Catalyst Resource Group, Inc., was served with the OIP by December
29, 2015, by USPS Express Mail delivery or attempted delivery at “the most recent address shown
on [its] most recent filing with the Commission.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). It is unclear
whether the mailing to Catalyst Resource Group, Inc., was directed to “the most recent address
shown on [its] most recent filing with the Commission.”
