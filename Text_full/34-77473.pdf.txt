Summary
1.
These proceedings concern the misappropriation of more than $18 million in investor
funds by Burrill Capital Management, LLC (“BCM”), a San Francisco-based exempt reporting
adviser, and its CEO, G. Steven Burrill (“Burrill”). From December 2007 through August 2013,
Burrill, through BCM, misappropriated approximately $18 million under the guise of “advanced

management fees” from Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III (“Fund III”), a $283 million venture
capital fund advised by BCM. Burrill took this money to cover cash shortages in his non-Fund III
related Burrill & Company businesses, pay employee salaries, and to support his lavish lifestyle,
including expensive vacations and gifts.
2.
By mid-2013, Burrill had misappropriated approximately $13 million more in
management fees from Fund III than it was required to pay in fees over the entire life of the fund.
Burrill was aided in his scheme by Victor Hebert, Esq. (“Hebert”), Chief Administrative Officer,
Managing Director and Chief Legal Officer for the Burrill entities, and Helena Sen, CPA (“Sen”),
the Controller and most senior accounting person for the Burrill entities.
3.
In August 2013, several members of Fund III’s Investment Committee discovered the
misappropriation and notified Fund III’s investors.

Other Relevant Entities
8.
Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III, LP (“Fund III” or the “Fund”) is a
private pooled investment vehicle and a Delaware limited partnership formed by Burrill in 2006.
Fund III is a $283 million, 10-year venture capital fund that invests in life sciences companies,
globally, from early stage companies to public companies. Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III
Partners, LP was the General Partner (“GP”) of Fund III during the relevant time period and BCM
served as Fund III’s investment adviser. Fund III was initially set to expire in February 2016, but
was extended in March 2015, to December 2017.
9.
Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III Partners, LP, (“GP”) is a Delaware
limited partnership and was the General Partner of Fund III during the relevant time period. It was
removed as the General Partner, effective March 2014. The members of the GP were Burrill,
Hebert (from October 2011) and a group of three other individuals who were not implicated in
Burrill’s scheme. The GP was entitled to Fund III’s management fees, or alternatively, it could
designate another entity to receive the fees. In exchange for management fees, the GP was
responsible for managing, controlling and conducting the affairs of Fund III. The GP selected
BCM to provide advisory services to Fund III.
10.
Burrill & Company, LLC (“Burrill & Co.”) is a Delaware limited liability
company created in 1993 and is wholly owned by Burrill. Burrill & Co. was the holding company
for Burrill’s several other business ventures, including his media group, merchant banking group
and Burrill’s personal ownership interests in the Burrill venture capital funds, including Fund III.
Burrill & Co. is currently nonoperational. Burrill & Co. did not participate in the management of
Fund III.
Facts
A. Background
11.
In 2006, Burrill formed Fund III, a $283 million venture capital fund focusing on
investments in life sciences companies, globally, from early stage companies to public companies
(known as “portfolio companies”). Fund III had a 10-year lifespan, and originally was set to expire
in February 2016. Fund III is structured as a Limited Partnership, with Burrill Life Sciences
Capital Fund III Partners, LP serving as its GP. Fund III’s investors are its limited partners, with
the six largest investors making up the Limited Partners Advisory Committee (“LPAC”). The
investors include state pension funds, public companies and institutional investors.
12.
Fund III is governed by a Limited Partnership Agreement (“LPA”), which
delineates, among other things, the manner and amount of management fees the GP is entitled to
from Fund III for managing the fund. According to the LPA, the GP (or its designee) is entitled to
2% of committed capital for six years payable on the first day of each fiscal quarter for services to
be rendered during that quarter (and then 2% of cost basis of the investments, plus reserves, after
the initial 6 years). From the management fee, as enumerated in the LPA, the GP was to cover
expenses in connection with the management of the fund (e.g., salaries, travel, wages, rent).
4

Although Fund III’s GP was technically entitled to receive the management fee, in practice this fee
was deposited in several different Burrill entities’ bank accounts, primarily BCM’s. The LPA did
not authorize Burrill to take management fees in advance, nor did it authorize Burrill to take loans
from Fund III. In addition, the LPA explicitly prohibited any actions that would be detrimental to
the activities and affairs of the fund and required that all conflicts of interest promptly be disclosed
to the LPAC. Burrill signed the LPA in his capacity as a member of the GP.
13.
At the outset of Fund III, each of its investors committed a specific amount of
capital and paid a percentage of this capital commitment to make initial investments in Fund III’s
portfolio companies. The investors contractually agreed to pay the remainder of their capital
commitment over the life of Fund III through periodic capital call demands made by the GP.
According to the LPA, this capital would then be used to invest in Fund III’s portfolio companies
and pay Fund III management fees as well as certain other Fund III expenses.
14.
From late 2008 through early 2014, members of Fund III’s Investment Committee,
which was comprised of Burrill, Hebert, and three other individuals, met multiple times a month to
determine which portfolio companies Fund III should invest in as well as determine the amount of
capital needed, in order to make additional follow-on investments in the portfolio companies.
After these meetings, Burrill and Sen, on behalf of Fund III’s GP, periodically sent capital call
demand letters to Fund III’s limited partners requiring them to fund the remaining portions of their
capital commitment so that Fund III could make additional investments in the portfolio companies.
15. Burrill operated a number of entities under the Burrill enterprise including other
venture capital funds as well as merchant banking and media businesses. Hebert and Sen were
employed by BCM and, although they provided services to BCM and Fund III, they also provided
services to other Burrill-related entities. Burrill used BCM as the operating entity through which
he received income from, and paid expenses for, all of the various Burrill-related entities –
including expenses that were wholly unrelated to Fund III’s business. He also took draws from
BCM, and charged personal expenses to, BCM, which were booked as additions to his draws.
16. BCM was Fund III’s investment adviser. Burrill wholly owned, and controlled, BCM.
As an investment adviser, BCM owed a fiduciary duty to its clients, one of which was Fund III.
This required BCM to act in the utmost good faith, and put the interests of its clients ahead of its
own. See SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180 (1963). This is so even
though BCM advised venture capital funds and filed reports as an “exempt” reporting adviser.
B. Burrill Misappropriates, and Hebert and Sen Aid and Abet the Misappropriation of,
Fund III’s Money
17.
In late 2007, BCM began to face cash flow shortages. According to BCM’s
accounting records, the expenses for the Burrill-related entities, as well as Burrill’s personal
expenses, far exceeded the revenue his businesses were generating. In late 2007, Sen met with
Burrill and told him that due to BCM’s cash deficit, BCM was unable to make payroll or pay
BCM’s expenses for that period. Burrill instructed Sen to take $400,000 from Fund III to make up
5

the cash shortfall and to treat the transaction as an “advance on management fees” that the GP
expected to earn in the first quarter of 2008. Burrill told Sen the advance management fees were
“strictly a timing issue” (because BCM was entitled to take the management fees four days later on
January 1, 2008).
18.
Sen had read the LPA, and understood that Fund III was supposed to pay
management fees to the GP at the beginning of each quarter for services to be provided to the fund
during that quarter. Nonetheless, at Burrill’s direction, Sen transferred money from Fund III’s
bank account to BCM. She recorded the transfer as a “prepaid expense” in Fund III’s books and
records.
19.
In mid-2008, Sen told Burrill that BCM was again short of cash, and unable to pay
its expenses. BCM’s expenses included salaries and Burrill’s draws and personal expenses.
Burrill told Sen to cover the shortfall by taking an advance on management fees from Fund III.
Sen followed Burrill’s instruction and again booked the management fee advance to the general
ledger as a prepaid expense. From that point forward through July 2013, on many occasions when
BCM faced a cash shortfall in a quarter, Sen acted under Burrill’s directive to cover the deficit by
taking money from Fund III, because it – as compared to all of Burrill’s other entities – had the
most money available to it in the form of committed, but still-uncalled capital.
20.
Hebert joined Burrill & Co. in October 2008 as Chief Administrative Officer, Chief
Legal Officer and Managing Director, and learned about Burrill’s practice of taking money from
Fund III to fund BCM’s cash shortages. Sen began reporting to Hebert in late 2008 and in the first
part of 2009, she told Hebert about the practice of taking money from Fund III to meet BCM’s
cash flow shortages, including Sen’s and Hebert’s own salaries and Burrill’s draws. Hebert never
told Sen to stop taking money from Fund III, and the practice did not stop until Fund III ran out of
money.
C. Cash Flow Meetings
21.
From early 2009 through July 2013, Sen, Hebert and Burrill met frequently to
discuss the Burrill enterprise’s cash flow. At these meetings, Sen informed Hebert and Burrill
about the various Burrill entities’ cash flow deficits. The three discussed the cash shortages and
decided to cure them by continuing to take money from Fund III, and book it to the general ledger
as prepaid expenses. Sen regularly informed Burrill and Hebert at the cash flow meetings how
much money they had taken under the guise of advanced management fees and also kept track of
the transfers on a document referred to internally as a “cash needs spreadsheet”. BCM’s
accounting manager provided these spreadsheets to Burrill when he signed the Fund III cash
transfer authorizations. On at least one occasion, Burrill directed Sen to take money from Fund III
and transfer it to his and his wife’s joint bank account, when there were no other funds available to
meet Burrill’s personal monthly draw, which he collected for providing services to Fund III and his
other non-Fund III related entities. In response to Burrill’s directive, Sen transferred money from
Fund III to BCM and then to Burrill and his wife’s joint bank account.

6

22.
By approximately the first quarter of 2012, the amount of money Burrill had taken
from Fund III exceeded the total amount of management fees that the GP could earn over the life
of the fund, which was set to expire in February 2016. At that point, in Q1 2012, no further
management fees were due to the GP from Fund III. Burrill, Sen and Hebert, continued to take
money from Fund III under the guise of advance management fees. By May 2013, the money
Burrill had taken exceeded the total management fees that could be earned over Fund III’s life by
at least $13 million – approximately four years’ worth of fees. Burrill used the $13 million to pay
for, among other things, salaries, rent, charitable contributions, Burrill’s family vacation to St.
Barth’s and Paris, jewelry, gifts and travel for Burrill’s girlfriend, gifts for Burrill’s wife, private
jets and private car service for Burrill and his family members.
D. Capital Calls and The “Cushion”
23.
Not only did Burrill, Hebert, and Sen misappropriate or aid and abet the
misappropriation of Fund III’s existing cash, they also asked investors for more money than was
needed for Fund III’s follow-on investments so that they could continue to fund BCM’s operations.
From early 2009 through approximately early 2014, Hebert led Fund III’s weekly Investment
Committee meetings. After the meetings, Hebert told Sen how much money the committee agreed
was needed for follow-on investments so that Sen could prepare the capital call letters. Sen drafted
the capital call letters, which specifically stated that the “proceeds of the capital call would be used
for [a particular investment]” or for general “follow-on investments” in Fund III’s portfolio
companies. With Burrill’s permission, Sen inserted Burrill’s electronic signature into the capital
call letters and sent them to the investors.
24.
In February 2009, Sen began inflating the amounts included in the capital call
demand letters above what the Investment Committee determined was needed for follow-on
investments and the then due management fees and expenses. Sen called the inflated excess
portion of the capital call the “cushion.” This “cushion” ranged from $50,000 to $1.5 million on
the applicable capital calls. Sen, knowing Burrill expected her to have excess cash on hand to
advance fees, added a “cushion” so there would be sufficient money in Fund III’s bank account for
Burrill to pay, among other things, BCM’s operating expenses (including her and Hebert’s salaries
as well as non-Fund III related expenses) and Burrill’s draws, personal expenses and Fund
management fees and expenses.
25.
Sen told Hebert about the excess portion of the capital call in 2009. Sen, Hebert
and Burrill discussed the excess at the cash flow meetings, after which, Burrill, with Hebert’s
knowledge, called in millions of dollars in additional capital from Fund III’s investors. Burrill and
Hebert knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the money called from Fund III investors
would be used in part to continue funding BCM’s cash flow shortages, significant portions of
which were wholly unrelated to Fund III’s business and included propping up Burrill’s other
business ventures that were operating at a loss. Neither of them disclosed the “cushion” to Fund
III’s investors, its Investment Committee, or any other members of Fund III’s GP. Moreover,
Burrill and Sen knew, or should have known, that the capital call letters misled investors into
7

thinking that the capital demanded was used only for follow-on investments and currently due
management fees and expenses.
26.
From 2008 until August 2011, in addition to preparing the capital call letters, Sen
signed bank transfers authorizing cash transfers from Fund III to BCM to cover BCM’s expenses
(as well as Burrill’s personal expenses). In August 2011, Sen stopped signing the transfer
authorizations because she was uncomfortable with how high the advanced fee balance had grown
(approximately $12 million). From that point forward, Burrill became the primary signer of the
bank transfer authorizations.
E. Delayed Milestone Payments to Investors
27.
Burrill, with Sen’s assistance, also funded BCM’s cash deficits by delaying the
distributions of portfolio company milestone payments and stock payments to Fund III’s investors.
Fund III periodically received payments from Fund III’s portfolio companies as they met specific
predetermined milestones. Burrill and Sen, on behalf of the GP, were responsible for distributing
those payments to Fund III’s investors based on their ownership percentage in Fund III, but Burrill
– with Sen’s assistance – instead used that money to pay BCM’s expenses, including expenses that
were wholly unrelated to Fund III’s business.
28.
In September 2012, Sen emailed Burrill that BCM had no cash available to make
payroll and stated “[t]here is only one other option, which is to delay a distribution” of the
approximately $1 million in milestone payments paid into Fund III and awaiting distribution to
investors. Burrill directed Sen to withdraw the milestone payments from Fund III, and she did.
Sen recorded the withdrawal in Fund III’s prepaid expense account. The following month, in order
to make the required milestone payments to Fund III investors, Sen added a $1 million “cushion”
to the October 31, 2012 capital call demand. Burrill and Sen then used the “cushion” to pay the
investors their milestone payment with the investors’ own money. None of this was disclosed to
investors.
F. The Scheme is Revealed to Investors
29.
In late August of 2013, Fund III’s Investment Committee members became aware
that virtually all the committed capital in Fund III had already been called in and spent. They
called an emergency meeting of Fund III’s Investment Committee.
30.
On September 4, 2013, Burrill and Hebert met with the Investment Committee to
discuss Fund III’s cash reserves. At Burrill’s direction, Sen created a spreadsheet showing how the
approximately $18 million taken under the guise of advanced fees was spent (including Burrill’s
personal expenses). During the meeting, Burrill admitted that he had taken money from Fund III
to develop other venture funds under the Burrill brand. He said he owed Fund III approximately
$7.8 million and Sen passed out a spreadsheet showing approximately $7.8 million was spent on
other venture funds’ development costs. Burrill directed Sen not to hand out the other portion of
the spreadsheet which detailed how the remainder of the fees were spent, which included Burrill’s
personal expenses.
8

31.
Before October 2013, Fund III’s investors did not know that Burrill had
misappropriated approximately $18 million from the Fund under the guise of “advance
management fees,” nor did they know that Burrill had taken $13 million more from Fund III than
the GP was entitled to earn over the entire life of the Fund. On October 27, 2013, three of the
Investment Committee members sent a letter to the Fund III LPAC and informed them about the
misappropriation. The LPAC subsequently removed the GP (which included Burrill and Hebert)
from managing Fund III, effective March 2014. In March of 2014, Hebert resigned from Burrill &
Co. and Sen’s position with Burrill & Co. was eliminated.
32.
All told, Burrill used approximately $4.6 million of the money he misappropriated
from Fund III to pay for his cash draws and personal expenses, including family vacations to St.
Barth’s and Paris, jewelry from Tiffany&Co., travel, charitable contributions, private jets, private
cars, and gifts.
Violations
33.
As a result of the conduct described above, BCM and Burrill willfully violated, and
Hebert willfully aided and abetted and caused, BCM’s and Burrill’s violations of Section 206(1) of
the Advisers Act which prohibits an investment adviser from employing any device, scheme, or
artifice to defraud any client or prospective client.
34.
As a result of the conduct described above, BCM and Burrill willfully violated, and
Hebert and Sen willfully aided and abetted and caused, BCM’s and Burrill’s violations of Section
206(2) of the Advisers Act, which prohibits an investment adviser from engaging in any
transaction, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or
prospective client.3
35.
As a result of the conduct described above, BCM and Burrill willfully violated, and
Hebert and Sen willfully aided and abetted and caused, BCM’s and Burrill’s violations of Section
206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, which prohibit an investment adviser to
a pooled investment vehicle from making any untrue statement of a material fact necessary to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading to any investor or prospective investor in the pooled investment vehicle, or engaging in
any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative with respect
to an investor or prospective investor in a pooled investment vehicle. A violation of 206(4) and
the rules thereunder does not require scienter. SEC v. Steadman, 967 F. 2d 636, 647 (D.C. Cir.
1999).

3

Scienter is required for violations of Section 206(1), but negligence is sufficient for violations
of Sections 206(2) or 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. See Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d
1126, 1134 (5th Cir. 1979); SEC v. Daifotis, 874 F. Supp. 2d 870, 887 (N.D. Cal. June 12, 2012).

For good cause shown, Commission staff may extend any of the payment dates set

O.
Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, a Fair
Fund is created for the disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties referenced in paragraphs I,
K, L and M above. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order
shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action"
means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
P.
After receipt of the disgorgement, interest, and penalties referenced in paragraphs I,
K and L above (distribution fund), the Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of the funds,
12

pay such funds to Fund III which suffered a net harm as a result of the violations described in this
Order. With respect to payments received pursuant to paragraph M, the Commission shall pay such
funds to Fund III on a timely basis. Commission staff will seek the appointment of a tax
administrator as the ordered payment constitutes a qualified settlement fund under section 468B(g)
of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 468B(g), and related regulations, 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.468B-1
through 1.468B-5. Taxes, if any, and related administrative expenses will be paid from the
distribution fund.
Q.
After receipt of the penalty payments referenced in paragraph M above (distribution
fund) and any additional payment received pursuant to paragraph M, the Commission shall, on a
timley basis, pay such funds to Fund III which suffered a net harm as a result of the violations
described in this Order. Commission staff will seek the appointment of a tax administrator as the
ordered payments constitute a qualified settlement fund under section 468B(g) of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 468B(g), and related regulations, 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.468B-1 through
1.468B-5. Taxes, if any, and related administrative expenses will be paid from the distribution fund.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondents, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondents under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondents of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
