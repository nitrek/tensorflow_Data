Executive Summary
This report outlines some key issues surrounding the field of human resource management in
EU member states. The study has been conducted in the Human Resources Working Group
(HRWG) under the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union. It aims at getting a picture
on current Human Resources (HR) management strategies, practices and outcomes.
The issue of ““Human Resources strategies to support organizational changes” is vast.
Therefore, this report does not claim to address all of the issues related to how much value
people add to an organisation. Nonetheless, it is an attempt to share key findings between EU
member states. Furthermore it would be sensible if the study could be completed and enriched
in future EU presidencies.
The main issues are briefly detailed below, along 3 main parts:
Strategy – HR strategies:
In HR literature, a number of various models and approaches try to demonstrate how a
strategic approach to HR can be translated into a set of coherent HR processes and practices.
These models have value in highlighting some fundamental issues and demonstrating the
importance of a strategic approach. However, they are generally focused on the development of
HR strategies with an implicit assumption that the organization is relatively autonomous in
developing its own strategy.
According to the survey results, HR strategies are generally aligned with governmental
strategies, supporting to a certain extent the organizational changes. Yet, in the public sector,
HR strategy is not autonomous and needs to take into account a range of different stakeholder
perspectives and to be focused at national level as well as lower local level.
Thus, the results of this study give positive information on a general national perspective,
where we see that HR strategies are “people oriented”, formalized and aligned with
government strategies. However, on the level of the various local administrations (not tackled
in this survey), HR strategies formulated on a central level might be distant from the actual HR
processes and practices in place. In other words, HR might be in line with certain government
strategies on a more “conceptual” level, yet, at a local level, these strategies are not
automatically developed. It is the ability to build a strategy appropriate to local requirements
and to implement it effectively that is also essential. It would be interesting to look more
closely at this important issue in future EU surveys.
Furthermore, the survey shows that although HR strategies are aligned with government
strategies, HR is not yet a generator of changes. The HR function does not anticipate on its
agenda important social or economical changes like for instance demographic changes.
Operational - HR processes and practices:
By looking at the operational side of the HR function, the report details that HR services in the
public sector are going through an ongoing evolution and modernization. HR actors have
realized how important the people issue is. Numerous and various types of HR projects are led
and planned in order to improve the HR function, its processes and practices.

3

Furthermore, the survey addressed more particularly recruitment and career management
processes. Various aspects of these 2 HR processes have been explored, where we see strong
public sector specificities combined with the use of new HR methods and tools. For instance,
in the recruitment process, written and oral examinations are still very important to ensure
transparency and equality for all citizens to apply for a job. However, methods such as
behavioral tests, assessment centers, job databases are being developed and used.
On that point again, the EU member states gave the information they had on their national
level. Therefore, the global picture on how these processes are practiced on a local level is still
missing.
Additionally, in order to bring some more tangible and measurable information on how the
“operational” side of HR creates value and is aligned with government strategies, other key
questions would have to be addressed in the future such as:
•

What are the most appropriate measures of effectiveness for the public sector HR
function?

•

On what does HR services actually report? HR functions ought to report more on key
people issues in order to show even more clearly its impact on organizational changes
and on government strategies;

•

How the HR function is practically organized: the HR team; HR actors’ competencies;
the size of the team: the number of civil servants per HR full-time equivalent (FTE); are
HR executives members of the highest-ranking leadership team in their ministry;

•

Evaluate on the local level how central HR strategies are developed;

HR services and technology
Outsourcing services and HR information technology are being extensively used now in the
public sector. Correctly implemented, these solutions remain key levers to enhance overall HR
service levels and reduce costs. These means can help redefining the HR role and assist HR in
becoming a real strategic partner.
Future HR challenges…
Sufficient attention has to be given to human resources management issues. Even if the results
show general positive trends, it is necessary to be cautious and not to be excessively optimistic
that once HR strategies are set and documented, the process of realization is quite simple and
straightforward. It is a long way and an ongoing evolution in developing effective HR
strategies and implementing them at all levels (central and local).
To be successful, the HR function must develop both an operational and a strategic HR
capacity. It is important for HR to support organizational changes and to act as a strategic
partner, yet it has to find an equilibrium between being a “strategic partner” and the
operational, day-to-day reality, which forms the core of the profession. HR is in constant
balance between:
- Strategy and daily operations,
- Being proactive and less reactive,
4

-

Implement tailored HR solutions for its specificities (there are multiple situations
where “off the shelf” solutions are not applicable),
Combining skills as a specialist (solutions expert) but also as a generalist in order to
cover all HR aspects and dimensions.

“The HR function should not try to run before it can walk”. Sound HR policies and practices
should be developed before attempts at more radical changes in employment practices are to be
pursued.

Introduction

1.1

Context

This report is based on the results of the questionnaire prepared for the Luxembourg
Presidency of the European Union. More specifically, it is part of a survey carried out in the
area of “human resources” across all 25 member countries and 4 candidate countries of the
European Union.
At the request of the Luxembourg Ministry of Public Service and Administrative Reform,
PricewaterhouseCoopers has developed the questionnaire and analyzed the answers provided.
The questionnaire theme was “Human Resources strategies to support organizational
changes”.
1.2

Methodology and participants

Questionnaire:
In January 2005, the on-line questionnaire has been launched and distributed to the 25 member
countries of the European Union, 4 candidate countries and to the European Commission. A
meeting in February gave the opportunity to clarify the approach adopted and the questionnaire
structure. The participants had 2.5 months to provide their answers. The data collection and
analysis began in March 2005, once the on-line questionnaire has been closed.
The results are presented to the HRWG on April the 18th and to the Directors General in June
2005.
The questionnaire focused on the following dimensions:
•
•
•
•

The strategy of HR departments and Governments to identify guidelines and anticipated
changes
The current organization and structure of the HR department in the public
administrations
HR common processes and practices relating to recruitment and career management
(other HR topics which have already been dealt with in the last previous presidencies
have not been considered)
The use of HR services and information technology tools

Response rate:
Out of the 30 questionnaires distributed, we received 25 completed questionnaires, which is a
global response rate of 83%. According to the EU member states, we received 24
questionnaires out of 25 that is a response rate of 96%; for candidate countries 1 questionnaire
out of 4, that is a response rate of 25%.

6

Data collection:
Participating countries were given the possibility to complete the questionnaire, either by hard
or by electronic copy. 15 participants completed the electronic version of the questionnaire.
Moreover, some of the countries gave very detailed answers to the questions providing
additional information, which have been taken into account in the present document.
1.3

Report format

In order to facilitate the reading and the comprehension of the report, the key points and
results have been highlighted in bold.
The report consists of 4 main sections.
•

Section 1: this section addresses the issue of HR strategic agenda. It evaluates the level
of integration of HR into global government improvement strategies (alignment gap). It
outlines the main HR projects that support the strategies targeted and looks at the
formalization of the HR strategies.

•

Section 2: this section analyses the current HR organization of HR departments in
European public administrations. It underlines the most common HR organizational
model of “a mix between a centralized and a decentralized organization”.

•

Section 3: this section analyses current trends in HR practices and policies with regard
to recruitment and career management. It shows how HR strategies are supported by
the “operational” processes.

•

Section 4: this section analyses the use of outsourcing and technologies by the HR
function, and how these solutions remain key levers to enhance overall HR services.

In order to be able to make interesting cross-national comparisons of the various EU member
states, we have finally chosen to look at the notion of career-based and position-based systems
that was more relevant than the country size or the geographical zones.
Most countries were able to provide good quality data. The results are based on this validated
data set, although it needs to be stressed that some participants did not answer all of the
questions. In these instances, we have used valid data where appropriate, but excluded missing
responses on a question-by-question basis. Yet, we have tried as much as possible to give
general trends for all the questions.
We would like to thank warmly everyone who took part in this survey. We are grateful
for the time taken by all participants to provide us with valuable information and data.

HR Strategies

Key external factors are driving radical changes to the way organizations work and shape the
strategic context for managing people at present and in the coming years. These factors are for
instance social and economical changes, technological evolution, operational environment, etc.
In this context of major people challenges, the role of the HR function is more than ever at the
centre of the action.
Administrations have now realized that success of the organizational changes depend on how
they design and implement a people strategy. 87 % of participants claim that their HR
strategy is integrated within their governmental plan and policies. The starting point for HR
staff to position itself as a strategic partner is to have their HR strategy linked to their
government policies.
When addressing the issue of HR management strategies, it is essential to understand and
analyze all the HR dimensions: Organization, People, Processes and Systems. HR strategy
includes all of these dimensions (see picture beneath).
This report will first address the HR strategies, and will then look at the other HR dimensions
that support this strategy: organization, processes and systems. The people dimension has not
been addressed directly by the survey and is therefore not depicted in detail in the report.

2.1

HR strategies

The survey results translate the trend that in recent years, it has become commonplace for
institutions to advocate that human resources are their most important asset. Thus, it involves
developing a rational HR approach with full support of the management and with a strong link
between HR and government policies. As shown in graph 3.I, favoring mobility of civil
servants is one of the main HR strategies with 63%, followed by enhancing flexibility of civil
servants with 58%, improving work quality with 54% and leadership development with 50%.
On the top of the HR agenda, there is an emphasis on “people issues”, that is favoring
mobility, flexibility and efficiency of civil servants.
HR actors have realized that direct organizational pay-offs are possible if specific
configurations of “people policies” are adopted. These HR policies mainly aim to:
- Secure the commitment of the workforce,
- Ensure highly flexible and innovative working practices,
- Establish a high quality of work by developing a skilled workforce.
This evolution focusing on adopting a more strategic approach to HR suggests a developing
consensus that human resources are the key source to competitive advantage because it is the
skills, behaviors and values of staff that are principal in an organization’s success.
Institutions doing well are those that systematically identify, use, develop and renew their core
competences.

Furthermore, better accessibility to information (i.e.: HR technology, tools for improving
information accessibility) and HR reforms (i.e.: reform of the remuneration system, reform of
the main HR processes) confirm that HR is taking into account these important strategic
issues.
The next graph 3.II depicts the HR strategies according to the type of HR organization
(centralized/decentralized). Issues like “implementation of tools for improving information
accessibility”, “restructuring of the HR role”, “reform of the HR processes” or “enhancing
flexibility of civil servants” are more important in an HR organization mixing centralization
and decentralization. It can be explained by the fact that as HR is on 2 levels, a central and a
local:
- More efforts are developed on handling an efficient communication between a
central body and local administrations (see graph 3.II “information accessibility”)
- In a mix HR organization, there is often a move from a very centralized model to a
decentralized model, implying some changes like restructuring of the HR role and
reform of HR processes
When it is fully decentralized, HR services can dedicate more time on very precise processes
such as recruitment and sustainable development (see graph 3.II “HR procedures for a top-ofthe-line recruitment” & “Introducing concrete measures related to sustainable development”).

Formalization of HR strategies
It is not only a matter of talking about a conceptual view of HR strategic issues, but also to
examine in practical terms if HR strategy is formalized in a government plan, with a precise
timeframe, or if it is not documented at all.
For a majority of respondents, HR strategies are included in a government plan. As shown in
graph 3.IV, most of the respondents (87%) gave a positive answer to this question. Moreover,
this graph reveals that HR strategy is formalized on a timeframe basis.

In graph 3.III above, 85% of respondents have indicated that their HR strategies are
supported by official written documents. On the one hand, this could reflect the specificity of
the public sector, in which HR strategy appears as an integrated part of legal documentation
and regulations. On the other hand, this data may confirm the fact that HR strategy is on the
way of growing recognition in the public administrations of EU member states.
Formalization of HR strategy could be seen as one of the most efficient ways to make it more
understandable for civil servants and, consequently to make them ready to follow it.
Nevertheless, for some countries, it was difficult to answer the questions because they were not
connected to their specific case. For instance in the United Kingdom, HR strategy is not timelimited. HR strategy is not in a form of a written document, but there are written rules and
regulations specifying the overall HR strategy.
Considering the Netherlands, there is no clear and documented HR strategy; in France, the
existing HR strategy is not supported by a written document or any specific legal regulations.
Going down more on the “operational field”, it is important to examine how each of the HR
strategies is underpinned by a series of enabling projects.
HR related projects2
Analyzing the open questions related to the “HR projects” and to the “HR challenges and
issues”, we have summarized the results underneath. The numerous projects that have been
stated by the respondents are regrouped along the HR dimensions mentioned in the
introduction of this report.

2

•

Strategic HR projects: competency development, reform of civil service tenure,
decentralization topics, equality/diversity promotion, strategic role of HR, etc. In
Austria, first steps towards the unification of the employment status of all federal
public servants and employees through a new Federal Staff Law (with function-related
protection against dismissal) have been taken. Furthermore, promoting mobility to the
institutions of the EU and its member states is one of the projects”.

•

Operational HR projects: training, learning, recruitment projects, research on personal
motivation and development, analysis of administrative issues in HR management. In
Germany for instance, there is a reform of the career advanced system.

•

HR information technology projects: implementation of various HRIS tools, such as
PeopleSoft HR package, SAP HR, teleworking, national web page creation, etc. For
example, in Denmark, an eGovernment project has been initiated by the central
government and the regional and local administrations in order to promote and to
coordinate the transition to eGovernment in the public sector. In Germany, the
implementation of an electronic HR organization system is being done.

•

Remuneration projects: they regroup development of new payment systems,
performance related and career progression programs as well as flexible payment
possibilities.

Tables indicating the details of these questions are included in annex.

12

•

Pension projects: they include online program for pension calculation, reform and
harmonization of pension systems. Austria, for example, has successfully finalized the
harmonization of the pension system in the federal civil service with the pension system
in the private sector at 1st January 2005. Thus, the pension system for federal civil
servants/employees now is the same as for any person working in the private sector.

Regarding the time line, some projects have been initiated earlier than five years ago, but
represent ongoing activities. This is the case, for example, of Italy, where the legislative
reform process for Human Resources Management has started in 1997. It concerned,
progressively, the reform of relations with the unions, the privatisation and new negotiations
for civil services, the new discipline of the assessment and control systems and, finally, the
management reform.
The numerous projects confirm the motivation of HR to become real partners for civil servants.
Interestingly, most operational HR projects reveal the practical implementation of guidelines
coming from strategic projects. There are real links between the “strategy” and the
“operation”.
Analyzing this large scope of HR projects, it is interesting to underline that HR actually
translates its strategies on an “operational level”. The graph below gives some examples of
projects that support the strategies in place:

Regarding HR issues and challenges, interestingly the results show no real differences between
issues and challenges. Issues that HR face at present become challenges in the future. Below
are some examples of mentioned issues and challenges:

13

-

Organization: centralization, more flexible structures, sharing services,
competitiveness between public and private sectors, reforms and modernization of
the public sector,
Processes: harmonization of procedures, modernization of remuneration systems,
obtaining sufficient process quality, introduction of competency management and
professionalization of HR services,
People: improving flexibility of civil servants, demographic changes and citizen
satisfaction, the development of leadership and individual accountability, …
Systems: introduction of HRM information system, technological modernization
and e-government

14

2.2

Government strategies

As already mentioned before, public administrations today are increasingly realizing the need
to undertake significant changes in order to modernize public sector and to get it more flexible
and efficient. In this scope, they understand just how important human capital issues are
becoming. A tight coupling between HR and government strategies is needed in order to go
through organizational changes with success.
The governmental strategy must not only be in accordance with legislation norms and
regulations, but also take into account a large variety of factors, such as economic growth,
demographic situation, human factor and technological progress. In other words, governmental
strategy is a result of a balance between legal regulations and non-legal factors which are
able to impact the existing patterns within organizations.
In the light of the March 2005 European Union Summit in Brussels, where enormous efforts
were focused on the re-launch and reinforcement of the Lisbon Strategy, some of the following
survey results seem to be in accordance with the idea of modernization, flexibility, accessibility
of information, quality of services, etc. The governmental strategies indicated beneath go in the
same direction.
The graph 3.V below shows the major areas of changes and the supporting governmental
strategies over the last 3 years:
-

Economical changes: the implementation of overall cost-reduction programs have
been an area of major change.

-

Organizational/Structural changes: the main governmental strategies have focused
on decentralization of tasks, harmonization of procedures, accessibility of
information and improvement of quality of services. All these issues are supported
by HR strategies and are in line with European Union guidelines.

-

Social changes: demographic changes come across as one of the most important
issues over last years. In the same way, public administrations become aware of the
need to reinforce the government image in the labor market in order to assume
competitiveness with the private sector.

-

Technological changes: last but not least, technological modernization of the
public sector becomes a new reality, which implies the critical analysis of the
existing organizational structures and methods of management and the search of
appropriate IT solutions. Moreover, technological modernization does not only
mean the implementation of IT tools, but also the ability to share knowledge trough
various collaborative interfaces.

As shown in this next graph, survey participants indicate modernization and innovation,
improving the quality of services and satisfaction of the citizen, administrative reform and
accessibility of information on the top of their government agenda. It confirms the wave of
change and modernization impacting the public sector. It is also interesting to see that the
various strategies evolve over time and that between 2003 and 2005, the focus has been
different.

Supporting the above analysis, as an example, the Danish Government has initiated
modernization of the public sector through a modernization program. The aim is to ensure that
the public sector is based on the free choice of the citizen, open, simple and responsive and that
the sector gives a sustainable added value. This modernization program includes a number of
initiatives to support various types of change.
The Swedish Government has a policy for the government administration as a whole. In the
year 2000, the government decided on an action plan that manifests the government’s basic
values of a “Public Administration in the service of Democracy”. The purpose is:
- To stress the further development of democracy,
- To support legal rights,
- To insure effectiveness in the public service.
Today the 4 issues which have been prioritized by the Swedish Government are as follow:
-

The government administration should be an example in the political efforts to reduce
sick leave in the labor market,
The government administration should be an example for the work to improve diversity
in working life,
The government administration should progressively provide more services to citizens
through the use of ITC. Agency services will increasingly be open to the public 24
hours a day, 7 days a week.
The government management of agencies shall develop progressively to promote
democracy, effectiveness and legal rights.

Among other government strategies supporting the various types of changes, survey
respondents indicate building service centers to increase the efficiency of support functions
including HR services and career development (Finland), or competency based HR
management (Latvia).

2.3

Alignment gap

In order to ensure the success of organizational changes in the public sector, HR strategy must
be aligned with the governmental strategy. This synergy relies on the alignment of the
following factors:
•
•
•

Vision
Objectives
Culture & Values change
Successful changes

Shared Vision

Strategy
of
gouvernement

Common Objectives

HR Strategy

Culture & Value change

According to the above scheme, sharing common vision gives the possibility to move in the
same direction and to set up common objectives. Although these objectives could be supported
by different action plans, all of them should meet the shared vision. Only by realizing how
important the role of human capital is in the context of organizational changes, even while
dealing with non-HR related issues, governments will be able to meet their ambitious goals.
Indeed, organizational changes imply critical review and redefinition of some of the existing
values, and this process, before it becomes common, starts at individual level. That is the
reason why the individual flexibility and accountability of civil servants could be seen as a
response to support organizational changes.
According to the results of the survey, and as already mentioned before, HR strategies are
generally aligned with the governmental strategies, supporting thus the organizational
changes.
However, on the level of the various local administrations (not tackled in this survey), HR
strategies formulated on a central level might be distant from the actual HR processes and
practices in place. In other words, HR might be in line with certain government strategies on a
more “conceptual” level. Yet, at a local level, these strategies are not automatically developed.
It is the ability to build a strategy appropriate to local requirements and to implement it
effectively that is also essential.
18

Summarizing the results of the survey, it is interesting to point out that main HR strategies,
such as favoring mobility of civil servants, enhancing flexibility of civil servants or improving
work quality go hand in hand with the governmental strategies, such as
modernization/innovation of public sector, improving of quality of services or satisfaction of
the citizen. Moreover, introducing actions to support the changes in values, mentioned among
main HR priorities, clearly confirm the idea that HR strategies are actively supporting the
organizational changes as well as the modernization of public administrations.

Pursuing the idea of supporting the organizational changes within the public sector, HR
strategy may play a more strategic role in the future than it does today by advancing some
important tendencies, such as demographic changes or technological evolution. In this context,
governments and public administrations will be better prepared to anticipate a possible
redesign of their strategy in order to be able to face fast growing and continuously changing
environment. In other words, HR strategy may be seen not only as an efficient support to
organizational changes, but also as a generator of changes.

HR Organization

As the graph below shows, the most common type of HR organization is a mix between a
centralized and decentralized structure. The responsibilities are divided between a central
body and local ministries, administrations and public institutions.

There is a sharing of HR responsibilities:
-

The central body has a more strategic role regarding HR by being responsible of HR
strategies and directions. For instance, it plays an important role in changing civil
service systems, in ensuring that public expenses and performance objectives are
met.
The HR policies and guidelines are developed and controlled centrally. Policies and
guidelines concern mainly HR processes such as recruitment, performance
appraisal, career management and training.
Apart from its more strategic role, the central body is still involved at a practical
level in the running of processes like remuneration and pensions and in the
management of Senior Civil Service. Various countries (the Netherlands, UK and
Sweden: the Swedish Directors general and some other top executives are managed
by the government itself through the government office) manage their top managers
in a different manner from the rest of the civil service. In the Netherlands for
instance, the Senior Executive Service is responsible for managing senior civil
servants on a centralized way.

-

The local ministries and administrations have the responsibilities of the HR daily
management. In Germany and Austria for example, it is entirely decentralized in
ministries, administrations and public institutions.

The most common type of public-sector bodies are ministries, like the Ministry of Interior, the
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Administrative Reform or Cabinet Office.
In general, HR management has been extensively decentralized. Most of the EU member
states have moved towards some degree of decentralization of HR responsibilities, from central
public-sector body to local ministries and public administrations. There is a tendency to
delegate HR practices to local public administrations. This allows the various public
administrations more autonomy and flexibility in their daily HR management. Local public
administrations can deal with their HR issues and tools following the central body strategies
and regulations. The structure of the Austrian HR organization is not entirely decentralized,
but a mix between a centralized and a decentralized system. In the future, the main challenge
for governments will be to find ways of maintaining consistency while transferring on some
HR responsibilities.
Yet, the extent and rapidity of delegation is different between the various EU member states
because there are differences between position-based systems (Denmark, Finland, Sweden,
UK, Austria) and career-based systems (Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain, Greece,
Hungary). The variety of environments (political, economical, culture) has an impact on the
way HR has been decentralized. A position-based system, being more decentralized than the
career-based system, gives more flexibility and allows an individualized approach to Human
Resources Management. There are also countries characterized by a “hybrid system”,
presenting elements from the position-based and career-based systems (like Italy). In these
countries there is a relatively high level of delegation, giving a lot of responsibilities to line
ministries in the definition and practices of Human Resources Management policies, and a
relatively low level of individualization in the approach to Human Resources Management.
The various forms of political and economical models across Europe have an influence on the
management of relations between workers and employers. These differences influence Human
Resources Management.
Sweden has a particularity as the system is very decentralized and the Human Resources
Management is the responsibility of each Swedish government agency. Each local agency
develops its own strategy and policy within the regulations set up by law and relevant
agreements between the social partners. The central body for coordinating government
employer policy and central negotiations is the Swedish Agency for Government Employers
(SAGE). The relationship between heads of agencies and the Government is both informal and
formal. There are formal steering documents for each agency. There also is a strong tradition of
loyalty and informality between heads of agencies and the Government such as, for instance,
the annual individual meeting of each minister with his/her subordinate Directors General. The
scope of these talks is on general business matters, budget and use of resources including HR
matters such as development of staff, competence needs, etc.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, the HR and government strategic issues of
decentralization of certain tasks, of harmonizing procedures, of conducting administrative
reforms, of improving accessibility of information to support decision-making are some of the
major types of changes over the last couple of years (see graphs 3.I, 3.V, 3.VI - pages 7 & 13).
All these issues encourage more efficiency and flexibility for instance by transferring some HR

21

responsibilities to local administrations, simplifying rules and procedures, developing more
flexible HR processes, …

HR Processes and Practices

As specified previously, the survey results indicate that government and HR strategies are
focused towards modernization, improving the quality of services, satisfaction of the citizen,
mobility and flexibility of civil servants, work quality, leadership developments…. HR
processes such as recruitment and career management are therefore essential in supporting
these strategies. The recruitment of skilled staff and their subsequent career management focus
on “selecting” and “developing” people who bring to public institutions the skills and
competences to attain the strategies decided.
In fact, in order to reach a certain level of quality of services and innovation, the right people
should be found and developed. As stated by the President of the European Commission, José
Manuel Barroso, “our clear aim is to achieve more and better jobs in a more dynamic,
innovative and attractive Europe. With this strategy I believe we now have the right tools to
achieve our goals.”
4.1

Recruitment

Recruitment is important because other HR policies are heavily dependent on the effectiveness
of this process. One of HR challenges is identifying, motivating and retaining talent.
Recruitment is attracting the right skills to do the job. Yet, the public service, just like the
private sector, has to compete in the “search for talent” in the face of demographic change. The
public sector has to compete with everyone else for attracting talent. The “search for talent” is
not to compete for a mass of numerous talents but rather to target for key individuals, focusing
then on continued development of people who are going to be the leaders of the future. The
society is asking people to do more efforts to prevail over enormous organizational and
economical challenges. Unfortunately today fewer people have the combination of right skills
that institutions need. Thus HR has
- To have a good understanding of government issues,
- To locate talent that can help achieve the goals,
- To develop and retain that talent.
Recruitment difficulties:
As the next graph illustrates, 42% of the respondents state that they have some recruitment
difficulties. Interestingly, 80% of them have difficulty recruiting specialized profiles. These
profiles are for instance in information technology, legal skills, lawyers, etc. In general,
specific expertise in various domains is difficult to recruit. Yet, this could progressively have
an effect on the governmental and HR strategies targeted. It can affect for instance
modernization or innovation. For some countries, the recruitment at the level of senior
management and senior government officials may represent a problem.
In countries with very decentralized and flexible HR organization, in general in position-based
system, recruitment difficulties are less critical (i.e.: UK, Sweden, Denmark, Austria…)

92% of the respondents state that they are required by law to publish vacancies for their civil
servants. Employment in the state sector is, as a rule, based on public notice of a vacant
position. This is to ensure transparency so that all citizens who fulfill the required conditions
have the opportunity to apply for the job. The governments have laid down rules for notices of
vacant jobs. This might also partly explain the recruitment difficulties, as the highly regulated
recruitment process is usually longer and less flexible in the public sector than in the private
sector.
In Spain for example, it is compulsory for the various public administrations to announce a
public convocation of all selection processes in their respective official gazettes. The process is
initiated by the public convocation, and done by the department to which the particular staff
corps is assigned. The department concerned also establishes the requirements candidates need
to comply with for being selected as well as the rules that will govern the selection process.
For 75% of the respondents, the educational background and diplomas is a key in the
selection process. Interview (71%) and written and/or oral examination (63%) are also
extensively used. Interestingly, some selection is also done via assessment centers and
behavioral and value tests for 42% of the respondents. Some countries such as Cyprus,
Estonia, Finland, Slovakia, Poland or the Netherlands have mentioned aptitude tests,
psychological tests, language tests or panel interviews. In Germany and Austria, the selection
process is done through assessment centers.
In order to attract and retain the right skills, more and more efficient and varied selection
methods are used. The use of technology to streamline the hiring process is not surprising,
given the direction the society in general is heading to. Many public administrations have taken
steps to keep up with the use of the Internet by such methods as putting job application
materials online, the use of assessment centers …

25

In Denmark, the state sector has set up a general job database – www.job-i-staten - where all
vacant jobs are advertised. In Ireland, the recruitment process is demand-led, that is vacancies
are advertised and processed online. In general there is a 2 years probationary period (but no
‘trainee’ status).
The Austrian Federal Chancellery has built up a general job-database
(www.bundeskanzleramt.at/job-boerse), where all vacancies (including leading positions) in
the federal service are published. Citizens can also find links to the relevant websites of the
regional authorities (governments of the Länder).
In the UK, the various recruitment steps apply in different cases. Local ministries and
departments are free to choose their own recruitment processes and will use a combination of
application forms, interviews and assessment centers. Educational background is not of great
importance except for specialist jobs. Candidates applying for the Fast Stream Program
(graduate program) from outside the civil service must have a University degree. The most
crucial criteria are those which indicate evidence of ability to do the job – for example, tests are
not set except in the skills required at the level of the post advertised.
Regarding recruitment, and the way it is handled, it is important to look at the various
European HR systems. In fact, as specified in the chapter on HR organization, there are some
differences between the career-based system and the position-based system.
The career-based system puts emphasis on educational background and competitive
written/oral examination (i.e.: France, Luxembourg, Greece, Czech Republic). In this
system, the decisions about recruitment and selection are frequently handled by a central
government body using staff ratios that are often inadequately linked to local administrations’
requirements. The selection procedures are part of a formalized recruitment process where
official exams have little links with the particular job vacancies.
In this system civil servants are usually recruited at the start of their career and remain in the
public service more or less through all their professional working life. There are in general
limited possibilities for entering the civil service in the middle of a career. Furthermore, career
development is very important. It can explain why in some EU member states, recruitment of
senior management may be problematic (see Graph 5.I - page 20).
The position-based system puts more emphasis on competition for posts and professional
experience (i.e.: Finland, Denmark, UK, Sweden, Austria). It is a more decentralized system
encouraging recruitment linked to local requirements, increasing the authority and
accountability of local managers. It rationalizes the process, allows to go quicker and to attract
the best candidates in the search for talents. It focuses on selecting the best-suited candidate for
each position. Position-based systems allow more open access and lateral entry is relatively
common.
A related issue, not tackled by this study, is the criteria used to select staff. The use of targeted
selection methods is driven by the competency framework. Coupled with problems of
recruitment and retention it makes sense to use more flexible recruitment methods.
To face recruitment difficulties, internal mobility can be a key to being competitive in the
future. Focusing on developing internal talent to meet future needs can be a good way to recruit
people. The various ministries and administrations must work in close cooperation to share

26

resources and information about internal candidates. Sharing information and developing talent
is essential. The data collected were not sufficient to examine the percentage of external
recruitment compared to internal mobility. EU member states seem in general to use both
ways to fill in vacancies.

Amongst the most implemented measures to facilitate and support internal mobility are
vacancies published on an Intranet (or some other network). Civil servants are given priority
for vacancies (before external hiring process is launched). The use of technological tools
(such as an Intranet) in order to sustain the internal mobility process, supports HR and
government strategies like modernization and better accessibility to information.
In Luxembourg, local administrations can decide to open vacancies exclusively for internal
recruitment. In the UK, internal mobility is high. Vacancies are published across the civil
service for posts in many ministries and some smaller departments rely heavily on staff on
secondment from other areas of the service.
In order to foster internal mobility, the Austrian authorities are under the duty to ascertain if a
post can be assigned to a qualified federal public servant/employee before the vacancy is
published. Therefore, internal vacancies are published via the Federal Chancellery on the
federal intranet. Additionally, the Federal Chancellery offers a special newsletter-service to all
interested federal public servants/employees in order to further disseminate internal vacancies.
Yet, in some EU member states, internal mobility programs appear to be rare. In Sweden since
all vacancies should be filled through open competition, internal mobility programs are
relatively rare except from agencies with formal corps, like the armed forces, police force, the
customs service etc. Judges and prosecutors follow a formal mobility pattern as well. In
Finland, the situation resembles that of Sweden. To encourage mobility, a top civil service

27

100%

reform has been proposed to include obligatory change of duties after five years of tenure.
International mobility is encouraged by financial support (travel and accommodation costs for
a limited period). In Cyprus, according to the Public Service Law (1990-2004) there are 2
categories of offices that are interchangeable and non- interchangeable. In the latter (which
counts for more than 80% of the total number of offices) internal mobility is not applied, with
the exception of secondment.
The promotion of internal candidates, the enhancement of promoting the government image by
attending forums and students fairs, the design of a special website to present government jobs
(see next graph 5.V.), as well as the improvement of the recruitment procedures (see next
graph 5.VI.) are ways to keep up with the private sector as the job market becomes more
competitive. With a shrinking labor market, employers must be more aggressive.
Reviews of the recruitment process and government image on the labor market:
In order to promote the image of the government on the labor market and to increase future
recruitment chances, 71% of the respondents state that they attend forums and student fairs,
67% design special websites to present government jobs and 50% give information on
benefits of government jobs. In some countries, like the Netherlands, the UK or Latvia,
campaigns are launched in newspapers, television and radio to improve the image of the
national government, practical trainings for university programs are organized in public
institutions, visiting universities, various promotion campaigns are done, etc.

Pursuing the idea of the complexity of the future demographic situation in Europe, public
administrations will not only face problems of retaining highly skilled civil servants, but also
problems of attracting talented graduates in public sector. In this context, the image of public
service should be reinforced and/or maintained on an adequate level.

The initiatives of the HR agenda are in practical terms supported by the recruitment reviews
under way and projected. EU member states realize the importance of an efficient recruitment
process by reviewing their procedures, improving the information flow, reducing bureaucracy
and paper-documents and implementing IT tools. The 2 graphs beneath underline this
tendency.

Headcount reduction program:
As previously shown in graph 3.VI (page 13), the implementation of an overall cost-reduction
program is one of the major government strategies that have been developed since 2003. This
point is still on the agenda of governments today. According to the HR agenda (graph 3.I –
page 7), “reducing headcount” (38%) and reducing labor costs (33%) are not top priorities.
Consequently there is a discrepancy between government and HR on the “cost reduction”
point. As the graph below shows, only 50% of the EU member states have announced or
scheduled a headcount reduction program.

In Sweden, the headcount reduction policy covers all public sectors, not only the State
administration. A single post ceases as soon as the person in place leaves the organization. All
public organizations are supposed to verify every new recruitment regarding to needs,
economic effectiveness, etc. At this point the employer has to examine whether the position
will be staffed again or if the freed resources may be transferred to use somewhere else in the
local agency. The headcount reduction is built into the system, so it is not a program, merely a
policy known and widely used.
In Austria, the reduction of headcount is one of the main priorities in HR management. The
governmental HR policy of the last years is strongly characterized by the re-dimensioning of
the federal service. Through the definition of concrete target figures for staff reduction and the
establishment of simultaneous HR-Controlling, a reduction of the workforce of the Austrian
federal service by 15.955 full-employment equivalents (9,4 %) could be reached between 1999
and 2003. Furthermore, a reduction of 10.000 established posts from 2004-2006 was
announced. This headcount reduction program covers all public sectors at the federal level
(exception: schools) and all categories of staff. As a consequence of this program the
workforce in the Austrian public sector is constantly decreasing whereas – due to various

30

modernization projects within the framework of the Public Administration Innovation Program
(e.g. e-government-offensive, implementation of the electronic file, e-payment and further
extension of the one-stop-shop) – the quality of the services delivered is constantly improving.
All staff categories are targeted in the headcount program. In Ireland, a reduction of 5000 was
announced in 2002 for the whole public service. Health Services, Police and elements of
Education are excluded. In Finland, all ministries and their spheres of administration are
preparing productivity programs which will be based on not replacing all the retiring civil
servants.
Regarding the workforce evolution (that is the difference between the numbers of recruitments
and departures), it is difficult to give trends due to the complexity of getting accurate data.
Some countries had difficulties to answer on the number of recruitments and departures. This
can be due to the decentralized HR organization where getting figures from various local
administrations is not easy. Yet, we can say that globally, there are more countries where an
increase of the workforce is noticed (that is more recruitment than departures).
Interestingly, the question was also complex to answer because in many countries the
categories of government employees and government blue-collar do not apply. The name of
people working in public administrations varies a lot from one country to another. In some
countries there is no distinction for the personnel of the state sector as a whole.

31

4.2

Career Management

In order to achieve the status of an employer of choice, the public sector must provide
challenging work, progressive human resources policies and opportunities for promotion and
career development.
As mentioned before, 80% of respondents state that they experience difficulties to find some
specific profiles, such as specialists in information technology and legal matters. Indeed, this
problem concerns not only the public sector, but also private companies, because skilled
employees are hard to find in many professional areas. Sometimes, they even could be in short
supply due to the high demand.
Best practice companies and administrations try to create and to implement specific career
management programs for high skilled people in order to retain them and to reinforce the
image of the company/administration on the labor market. Most of them qualify the internal
promotion as one of the incentives able to assure to the civil servant the recognition of his/her
personal involvement in the ministry/administration activities. An approach to career
management can consist in the implementation of a performance management cycle as
indicated by the diagram.

Performance management system and appraisal:
Comparing public and private sectors, the main difference generally consists in different
approaches to career management. Although seniority and experience are considered as ones of
the main career advancement factors in the private sector, a significant part of its career
management relies on performance-based systems.
Today, a majority of public administrations have introduced appraisal systems and
performance assessment, changing progressively their career system. Performance appraisals
have an important role to play in ensuring that civil servants are aware of the expectations and
objectives required and that transparent promotion criteria are developed.
This HR process also forms an important element of the general HR strategy because it
provides important information for HR planning and training purposes and can also help
communicate key messages. The emphasis is more on individual performance. As the survey
results underline, the public sector in EU member states indicates that performance
assessment and appraisals are extensively used supporting thus HR strategies like:
- Mobility and flexibility of civil servants
- Improving work quality
- Leadership development.
The HR strategies (stated at the beginning of this document) are in practical terms
translated in HR departments. The underneath graph confirms this idea and indicates that 75%
of respondents already use the performance management system. The performance
management system is usually applied to middle management positions (67%), followed by
senior management or senior government officials (63%) and support staff (50%). Not
surprisingly, management is in general primarily concerned by settling and achieving
objectives; therefore when introducing a performance management system, the management is
first concerned, then it is in general extended to the rest of the staff. The survey reveals that in
some EU member states a performance related pay is being introduced, with performance pay
contracts for senior management also.

In Denmark, performance assessment management is applied to all civil servants, like in
Poland, where the assessment system applies to all civil servants without any distinction of
grade.
In the United Kingdom, some ministries may consider appraisal reports in their promotion
systems. Appraisal reports may also be used as a mean of identifying eligible civil servants for
internal mobility and training needs. In most ministries, the appraisal system and the
performance related pay system are already closely linked. In addition to that, it is important to
point out that all civil servants must set yearly objectives on which they are appraised.
Different competences and skills are appraised in the different departments.
In Sweden, as the HR organization is decentralized, different systems are used in the diverse
agencies. Each agency may choose or develop any system that fits the actual needs. Most
agencies use more informal systems such as yearly development and pay talks between each
employee and his/her immediate supervisor.
In Portugal, career advancement is based both on seniority and on performance assessment.
Promotion is subject to fair and open competition, which may include multiple existing
assessment methods or public examinations, such as curriculum vitae assessment,
qualifications, training hours as well as personality assessment tests.

The performance assessment influences, in a greater or lesser extent, training,

As the above graph indicates, training emerges apart. This is not surprising as training is
seen as a way to improve the person’s competence in order to help him/her in achieving the
desired objectives.
It is possible to distinguish 2 blocks, on one side “remuneration”, on the other side
“advancement/promotion”. This can again be explained by the differences between positionbased and the career-based systems. The emphasis on remuneration for good performance is
relatively stronger in position-based systems, while the emphasis on promotion is stronger in
career-based systems.
Regarding the appraisal process a scale of assessment criteria is established in order to get
more objectivity. Obviously, some of them may be considered as more important than others.
Interestingly, the graph 5.X. indicates that survey respondents gave the same priority to
responsibilities, people skills and objectives achieved with 75% for each of them.

The alignment of these criteria is not surprising and complies with the efforts of public
administrations to reinforce individual accountability of civil servants, further recognition of
the importance of human capital as well as the promotion of performance management.
Flexibility of civil servants and improvement of work efficiency (i.e.: which are HR strategies)
can be achieved if every civil servant meets his/her responsibilities and objectives.
Among other criteria mentioned by respondents, it is interesting to point out: strategic skills in
order to find out successful ways of reaching the objectives (Sweden), initiative and

35

cooperation (Cyprus), code of ethics (Slovakia), creativity and organization (Slovenia),
judgment & analysis, working with others (United Kingdom).
Promotion:
As far as the survey results are concerned, the promotion in public administrations means
both a new grade/level and a salary increase. Indeed, as the graph below shows, 67% of
respondents confirm this fact. For only 8 % of respondents, the promotion is not linked to the
change of grade or salary increase.
Graph 5.XI. When civil servants are promoted, this means…

In France, the promotion may lead not only to the grade change or salary increase, but also to
an internal ranking (i.e.: concours interne, liste d’aptitude).
In Poland, the decision regarding the change of grade and salary increase is flexible and
depends very often on budgetary resources, but there is also a possibility to promote a civil
servant without a new grade or salary increase. For Finish civil servants, promotion means not
only salary increase, but also an appointment to a new more demanding job. In Latvia, in
addition to a bonus attribution and a higher position, the promotion usually means public
appreciation and recognition (public thanksgiving). In Germany, performance is an important
requirement for promotion.
In this context, it is interesting to put into light, that in Ireland, promotion could also
correspond to a move to a new ministry. Indeed, 40% of promotions involve mobility between
ministries and this tendency is going to increase to 50% in 2007.
The decisions for granting a promotion are usually based on specific requirements as indicates
the graph below.

Interview

75% of respondents gave the priority to interview, followed by people skills management
(54%) and technical skills ability (50%).
Indeed, during the interview, there is a possibility to emphasize strengths and weaknesses of
the civil servant who is candidate for a promotion. Interestingly, people skills management is
more significant than technical skills ability, which confirms the increased importance of the
human factor over the last years. Furthermore, the main goal of this requirement is to detect the
ability to manage individuals and teams in a most appropriate manner in order to make them
reach common objectives.
As for recruitment, differences between the various EU member states can be found on the
basis of differences between the career-based and the position-based systems.
When the promotion system is based on the career, it can include several requirements and
criteria, such as passing exams, mandatory training days and seniority. As an example, in
Cyprus, according to the Public Service Law, the claims of officers to promotions are
considered on the basis of merit, qualifications and seniority. In Slovakia, the promotion
depends mainly on the successful results of the qualification and nomination exams. In Italy,
the professional progressions are regulated by collective agreements and general selection
criteria are established in accordance to them.
In Spain, officials in the public administrations essentially can advance professionally:
•
Through being promoted to higher positions in the official service, which entails greater
responsibility and higher remuneration;
•
Through being promoted from a staff division that forms part of a particular qualification
group, to another which forms part of a higher qualification group;

37

In a position-based system, as in the UK, promotion is usually based upon a combination of
factors such as interviews, assessment centers and recommendations by managers. These
factors must be considered in the light of the individual’s ability to carry out the higher
grade job. Being a civil servant in a Swedish agency often means meeting built in demands on
personal development. Therefore individual development talks between managers and their
subordinates are widely used in order to identify needs and ambitions for personal development
during the forthcoming years.
Personal and leadership development programs:
The promotion process is not only linked to change of grade, internal mobility or financial
incentives, but may also include non financial initiatives, as for example, programs focused on
personal development of civil servants or leadership programs.
In EU member states, leadership development is a top HR strategy (graph 3.I – page 7). In
recent years, many governments have positioned leadership development as a high priority.
Personal and leadership development programs enhance the individual potential of civil
servants in order to help them better respond to the professional situation and consequently
to deliver high quality services to the citizen (see graph 3.VI – page 13). Furthermore, in a
more decentralized organization, with local administrations working independently, there is a
need to ensure sound coherence and coordination between central government policies and
local administrations. Therefore, sound leaders must be recruited and trained.
The graph 5.XIII shows the most common approaches of EU member states to promote
leadership development programs. Not surprisingly, leadership training is placed by the
survey respondents on the top of ranking with 71%, followed by people skills training with
67% and performance appraisal feedback with 54%. 16% of the respondents state that they do
not have any leadership development program.
Training is still the most utilized method. E-learning solutions and 360° feedback are less
favored. These methods, highly used in the private sector, have to enter progressively in the
culture of the public sector and be adapted to its specificities.
The focus on leadership, people skills performance, appraisal feedback as opposed to on-thejob training or e-learning shows that, for the leader level, the importance is very much on the
ability to manage people, to provide colleagues with a constructive feedback during appraisal
process as well as the capacity to assume the role of leader. It is less on the individual way of
working.

As far as personal development programs for civil servants are concerned, they remain in
Swedish agencies, as one of the most important subjects of discussion between managers and
their subordinates. They are widely used in order to identify needs and ambitions for personal
development during the forthcoming years. Therefore, the different agencies may use different
strategies and tools for their leadership development (some agencies use 360o feedback, but the
method is not yet common).
The Austrian “Centre for administrative management” (ZVM – Zentrum für
Verwaltungsmanagement) offers a special management program which especially targets
public service leaders. The management program offers a variety of courses, seminars and
trainings. Furthermore, special attention is given to topics of high priority and current
developments in the public service (e.g. good governance, public private partnership).
In the United Kingdom, there are a number of different leadership programs implemented at
senior level, combining the methods like performance appraisal feedback, leadership training,
feedback from colleagues, etc. Other approaches include mentoring programs, Action Learning
Sets, etc.
In France, several training programs regarding individual competences and leadership
approaches have been set up to promote personal development of civil servants.

39

0.8

Finally in Ireland, there is no formal leadership development program confined to senior
management, however elements of leadership development apply to all staff in management
positions.
Being a leader in the public sector is not easy; many challenges have to be faced. As specified
in a Financial Times/PricewaterhouseCoopers study titled “Mastering Leadership”4, executives
in the public sector face challenges like:
- Developing strategies that create benefits, as opposed to profits, at an acceptable
rate of return on “political capital employed”,
- Navigating the dynamics of power and politics,
- Harnessing the power of organizational mission and shared values.
Public-sector executives face a variety of obstacles and challenges when implementing
strategies. For example, measures of success and service effectiveness are notoriously difficult
to establish, making evaluation and accountability problematic. They face unique obstacles in
leading organizational change, in part because of entrenched civil service bureaucracies,
procedural constraints such as managing performance and firing people, and dealing with many
different stakeholders with competing priorities.

HR Services and Information Technology

The persistent pressure to enhance service (both internally and externally), to modernize the
work environment, to ensure good accessibility to information and maintain efficient first class
systems seems incessant. Government and HR both realize these challenges (graph 3.I & 3.VI)
and have accepted the notion that they need to decrease the percentage of effort devoted to
utility functions and increase the time spent on partnering and value added activities. The
concepts of outsourcing and HR technology address this issue, by helping HR professionals in
lightening their administrative burden. Correctly implemented, these solutions remain key
levers to enhance overall HR service levels and reduce costs. These means can help redefining
the HR role and help HR in becoming a real strategic partner.
5.1

HR Services

Outsourcing brings in some flexibility as it can be used only when needed and for defined
time intervals, from short to longer periods. The flexibility it provides, allowing controlling
costs in a better way, is a means favored by HR services. Outsourcing is not only an emerging
trend anymore, but is present in HR practices. The HR function has realized that outsourcing is
a major channel to free up more time for value added activities and to improve its efficiency on
the road towards real strategic partnership.
According to the results, when used, this channel serves mainly two purposes:
-

Outsourcing of administrative tasks such as maintenance of HRIS, allowing to free more
time for the HR function to focus on delivering quality service to the employees. It allows
companies to assign high-performing personnel to critical initiatives. In Italy for instance,
they benefit from a helpdesk service for IT.

-

Outsourcing of activities where specialist expertise is needed: such as training delivery
or assessment centers is a means to benefit from high-level external expertise services.
A majority of respondents seem to use mainly the external services of HR consulting
companies and training centers. In Poland, opinion poll companies are used. In Cyprus, a
consulting company has been appointed for the introduction of a new appraisal system. In
Sweden all kinds of outsourcing services are used. A supporting agency in Sweden, the
Swedish Agency for Quality and Development, carries tasks to support local agencies
with quality management, courses about being a civil servant, advices through seminars
and networks in the field of competence management.

In fact, interestingly in the public sector, as the organization is often a mix between central
bodies and local administrations, the outsourcing can be done “internally”. That is local
administrations benefiting from the services of a central body, specialized in a type of service
such as payroll or training. For instance, the Cyprus Academy of Public Administration
(CAPA), which falls under the competence of the Public Administration and Personnel
Department, is the main body responsible for designing and implementing training programs in
the Cyprus civil service, aiming at contributing to the efficiency and effectiveness of the civil
service through the development of the capabilities/skills of civil service staff and the
enhancement of the ability of organizations and individuals to learn. This central body in the
framework of its activities also uses external outsourcing (i.e. uses HR outsourcing Consulting
41

companies and training organizations from the private sector, to design and deliver specific
training programs for civil servants). In Portugal, the National Institute of Administration is
used.
5.2

HR technology

As mentioned various times in this document, EU public administrations are further
experiencing an increase in the use of technology, whether web-based tools or integrated HR
information systems (HRIS). The survey results indicate that the change in HR technology and
the implementation of tools for improving information accessibility stated as top HR strategies
are supported by various HR IT projects like:
- Tools for developing personnel and management policies
- Implementation of HRIS (SAP, Peoplesoft, Oracle)
- New electronic personnel organization system
- Implementation of electronic file
- Creation of HR portals
- Introduction of the electronic signature
These initiatives are in line with the eEurope, and more precisely the eGovernment program
promoting the information society and a better use of technological tools. As mentioned on the
Europa web site, “eGovernment is defined as the use of information and communication
technologies in public administrations combined with organizational change and new skills in
order to improve public services and democratic processes and strengthen support to public
policies. Advanced technology is needed to provide for smarter, personalized, time-saving
interaction with clients.” Indeed, by promoting innovation and quality of services, governments
reinforce the efficiency of day-to-day activities and consequently the delivery of services to the
citizen.
As shown in graph 6.I, a majority of respondents, 94%, use IT tools: 35 % of the survey
respondents deploy software applications; 31% indicate the implementation of ERP systems
and 28% currently develop database tools.

Among the ERP used, the survey respondents indicate mainly SAP, Peoplesoft and Oracle.
This is not surprising since these companies are leaders on the market offering a wide range of
possibilities all across the various functions of the organization.
For instance, SAP-HR is currently implemented in Luxembourg. Moreover, SAP system
comes across as a tool used for harmonizing HR processes and facilitating administrative tasks.
In Austria, an HR integrated technological tool is used. In the UK, it is up to each local
department to decide which IT tools to use. Most departments are moving towards SAP or
Oracle solutions. In Ireland, the Peoplesoft HR package is being implemented.
However, with the multiple sets of tools available on the market, it is necessary that HR
departments select the most appropriate system for their specific needs. Parameters such as
administration size, process complexity, work philosophy, existing systems, etc…must be
closely looked at before moving to system implementations, which can be time-consuming and
unmanageable.

Conclusion

This report has outlined some major issues surrounding the field of human resources
management in Europe. It aims at helping participants to get a clear picture of current
HR trends, practices and outcomes.
The subject of “human management strategies to support organizational changes” is
vast and complex; the Luxembourg Presidency has therefore tried to approach it from a
certain angle. This report does not claim to address all of the issues related to how
much value people add to the public sector. Nonetheless, it is an attempt to share some
findings and ideas, and give a broad view in terms of HR strategies in Europe.
The key points are:
•

By implementing its strategies, HR services support organizational changes. HR
actors have realized that direct organizational pay-offs are only possible if specific
configurations of “people policies” are approved. Therefore, the main policies are
“people” oriented towards mobility, flexibility and efficiency of civil servants.

•

HR strategies are generally aligned with the governmental strategies, supporting
thus the organizational changes. Yet, even if HR is an efficient support to
organizational changes, it is not yet a generator of changes. Furthermore, on the
level of the various local administrations (not tackled in this survey), HR strategies
formulated on a central level might be distant from the actual HR processes and
practices in place. In other words, HR might be in line with certain government
strategies on a more “conceptual” level, yet, at a local level, these strategies are not
automatically declined.

•

Formalizing HR strategy and linking it to the overall government plan is done by
87% of the countries. A documented HR strategy represents the “backbone” of
effective people management with mutually supporting HR policies and practices.
However, it is the ability to build a strategy appropriate to local requirements and to
implement it effectively that is also essential.

•

The HR strategies are in practical terms translated into numerous HR projects and
they do not “become a dead letter”. They have furthermore a direct impact on the
HR organization and the way HR is practiced like recruitment and career
management.

•

HR organization has been extensively decentralized in some EU member states.
The main common HR organization is a mix between a central body and local
administrations. It ensures more flexibility and efficiency, supporting thus the HR
agenda. Yet, the extent and rapidity of delegation is different between the various
EU member states because there are some differences between position-based
systems and career-based systems.

44

•

A combination of strong public sector specificities and new HR tools and methods
can be seen in recruitment and career management. This reinforces the public sector
diversity and ongoing evolution and modernization.

•

There are recruitment difficulties on specialized and high-level expertise profiles. In
order to attract and retain the right skills, more and more efficient and varied
selection methods are implemented. The use of technology to streamline the hiring
process is very common.

•

Performance assessment and appraisals are extensively used supporting thus HR
strategies like mobility and flexibility of civil servants, improving work quality or
leadership development. 75% of respondents use a performance management
system.

•

Leadership development is a top HR strategy. In recent years, many governments
have positioned leadership development as a high priority. Personal and leadership
development programs enhance the individual potential of civil servants in order to
help them better respond to the professional situation and consequently to deliver
high quality services to the citizen.

•

There is no best way to deliver HR service. Outsourcing services are however
becoming more important, helping HR to improve its service delivery. Furthermore,
HR information technology is today extensively used in the public sector,
supporting HR services in modernizing and becoming real strategic partner.

To continue gaining a strategic positioning within the public sector, HR executives
need to develop a strategic HR architecture which clearly shows employees and
management how people create value and how the value creation is measured. HR
actors can only become strategic partner if the administrative issues are implemented
and working. HR actors have various roles to assume in an intelligent equilibrium (see
picture below).

The HR function is still facing major change challenges. It can still be seen as a
peripheral activity. It therefore needs to always balance its role between operation and
strategy and be less influenced by generic “off the shelf” HR models, and more
influenced by what civil servants and government need from a professional function to
promote the highest achievable level of contribution from its people.
To conclude this report, we would like to thank all participants again for the time and
efforts they spent on this survey.
