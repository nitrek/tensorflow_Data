ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17070
In the Matter of
3C ADVISORS & ASSOCIATES, INC.,
STEPHEN JONES, AND
DAVID PROLMAN

ORDER

On January 27, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On February 18, 2016, I postponed the hearing in this matter
and scheduled a prehearing conference for March 7, 2016. 3C Advisors & Assocs., Inc., Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3622, 2016 SEC LEXIS 609. Further, I noted that service of the OIP
on Respondent David Prolman had not been confirmed and ordered the Division of Enforcement
to provide an update on the status of service as to him by March 2, 2016. Id.
In a letter filed February 19, 2016, counsel for Prolman requested a thirty- to sixty-day
extension of these proceedings so that Prolman can retain counsel with experience handling
Commission matters.1 I construe this request as a waiver of Prolman’s right to a hearing within
thirty to sixty days of service of the OIP. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(b); OIP at 6.
Prolman’s request is DENIED. If this matter proceeds to a hearing, such hearing would
likely occur at least four months from now, providing Prolman sufficient time to retain counsel
and prepare. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2). Prolman need not file an answer prior to the
upcoming prehearing conference. At the conference, in addition to the topics referenced in my
prior order, I will discuss with the parties what date Prolman was served with the OIP, and I will
set a deadline for Prolman to file his answer. The Division should still provide an update on the
status of service as to Prolman by March 2, 2016.

Prolman’s counsel also requested a postponement of the hearing initially scheduled for March
7, 2016. This request is DENIED as moot because the hearing is already postponed.
