INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
AND RULE 102(e) OF THE
COMMISSION’S RULES OF PRACTICE,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

In the Matter of
BLAIR D. ACKMAN, CPA
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Blair D.
Ackman (“Respondent” or “Ackman”) pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule 102(e)(3) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.1
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
1

Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:

The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing,
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations
thereunder.

purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these
proceedings and the findings contained in Section III.2 below, which are admitted, Respondent
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section
203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
Ackman was the chief financial officer and a 5% shareholder of
MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, LLC (“MGRA”), an investment adviser registered with the
Commission from 2004 through July 2013. He is a certified public accountant licensed in Illinois.
Ackman, 44 years old, is a resident of Livonia, Michigan.
2.
On June 23, 2016, a final judgment was entered by consent against
Ackman, permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the
Advisers Act, in the civil action entitled United States Securities and Exchange Commission v.
MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, LLC, et al., Civil Action Number 13-CV-12520, in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.
3.
The Commission’s complaint alleged that, in early 2008, MGRA and its
CEO, Chauncey C. Mayfield (“Mayfield”), misappropriated approximately $3.1 million belonging
to one of the Detroit public employee pension funds and used the money to purchase two retail
shopping centers on behalf of MGRA affiliates.
4.
The complaint alleged that Ackman learned of the misappropriation by late
March 2008. The complaint further alleged that, despite his fiduciary obligations, Ackman kept
the misappropriation a secret from the pension fund, and devised a plan with MGRA’s other
principals to secretly pay back the pension fund without the pension fund ever learning of the theft.
5.
The complaint alleged that Ackman and the other MGRA principals
affirmatively misled the pension fund through financial reporting and an extensive budget
presentation. The complaint further alleged that MGRA eventually disclosed the misappropriation
to the pension fund in late April 2012, after which the pension fund promptly fired MGRA.
6.
The complaint alleged that Ackman’s actions aided and abetted MGRA’s and
Mayfield’s violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
2

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that
A. Ackman is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an
accountant.
B. After 3 years from the date of this order, Respondent may request that the Commission
consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the Chief
Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
1.
a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review,
of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission. Such an
application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent’s work in his practice before the
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company for
which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the
Commission in this capacity; and/or
2.
Commission that:

an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the

(a)
Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“Board”) in
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective;
(b)
Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which he
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify any criticisms of
or potential defects in the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate that
the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision;
(c)
Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board (other than
reinstatement by the Commission); and
(d)
Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as Respondent
appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all
requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all requirements
relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.
C.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent to resume
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current
and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of
accountancy. However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission,
the Commission will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review
may include consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters
relating to Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear
or practice before the Commission.

D.
Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, Respondent Ackman is barred from
association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal
advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, with the right to
apply for reentry after three (3) years to the appropriate self-regulatory organization, or if there is
none, to the Commission.
Any reapplication for association by the Respondent will be subject to the applicable
laws and regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned upon a
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the following:
(a) any disgorgement ordered against the Respondent, whether or not the Commission has
fully or partially waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to
the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-regulatory
organization arbitration award to a customer, whether or not related to the conduct that
served as the basis for the Commission order; and (d) any restitution order by a selfregulatory organization, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the
Commission order.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
