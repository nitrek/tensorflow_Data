Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in
Rule 506 and Rule 144A Offerings
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rules.
SUMMARY: We are adopting amendments to Rule 506 of Regulation D and Rule 144A
under the Securities Act of 1933 to implement Section 201(a) of the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act. The amendment to Rule 506 permits an issuer to engage in
general solicitation or general advertising in offering and selling securities pursuant to
Rule 506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited investors and the
issuer takes reasonable steps to verify that such purchasers are accredited investors. The
amendment to Rule 506 also includes a non-exclusive list of methods that issuers may
use to satisfy the verification requirement for purchasers who are natural persons. The
amendment to Rule 144A provides that securities may be offered pursuant to Rule 144A
to persons other than qualified institutional buyers, provided that the securities are sold
only to persons that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably
believe are qualified institutional buyers. We are also revising Form D to require issuers
to indicate whether they are relying on the provision that permits general solicitation or
general advertising in a Rule 506 offering.
Also today, in a separate release, to implement Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are adopting amendments to Rule

506 to disqualify issuers and other market participants from relying on Rule 506 if
“felons and other ‘bad actors’” are participating in the Rule 506 offering. We are also
today, in a separate release, publishing for comment a number of proposed amendments
to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156 under the Securities Act that are intended to
enhance the Commission’s ability to evaluate the development of market practices in
Rule 506 offerings and address certain comments made in connection with implementing
Section 201(a)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.
DATES: The final rule and form amendments are effective on September 23, 2013.

AMENDMENTS

INTRODUCTION
On August 29, 2012, we proposed rule and form amendments 14 to implement

Section 201(a) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). 15 Section
201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act directs the Commission, not later than 90 days after the date of

14

See Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and
Rule 144A Offerings, Release No. 33-9354 (Aug. 29, 2012) [77 FR 54464 (Sept. 5, 2012)] (the “Proposing
Release”).

Pub. L. No. 112-106, sec. 201(a), 126 Stat. 306, 313 (Apr. 5, 2012).

enactment, to amend Rule 506 of Regulation D 16 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
“Securities Act”) to permit general solicitation or general advertising in offerings made
under Rule 506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited investors. 17
Section 201(a)(1) also states that “[s]uch rules shall require the issuer to take reasonable
steps to verify that purchasers of the securities are accredited investors, using such
methods as determined by the Commission.” Section 201(a)(2) of the JOBS Act directs
the Commission, not later than 90 days after the date of enactment, to revise Rule
144A(d)(1) under the Securities Act 18 to permit offers of securities pursuant to Rule
144A to persons other than qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”), 19 including by means
16

The Commission adopted Regulation D in 1982 as a result of the Commission’s evaluation of the impact
of its rules on the ability of small businesses to raise capital. See Revision of Certain Exemptions From
Registration for Transactions Involving Limited Offers and Sales, Release No. 33-6389 (Mar. 8, 1982) [47
FR 11251 (Mar. 16, 1982)]. Over the years, the Commission has revised various provisions of Regulation
D in order to address, among other things, specific concerns relating to facilitating capital-raising as well as
abuses that have arisen under Regulation D. See, e.g., Additional Small Business Initiatives, Release No.
33-6996 (Apr. 28, 1993) [58 FR 26509 (May 4, 1993)] and Revision of Rule 504 of Regulation D, the
“Seed Capital” Exemption, Release No. 33-7644 (Feb. 25, 1999) [64 FR 11090 (Mar. 8, 1999)].
17

The definition of the term “accredited investor” that is applicable to Rule 506 is set forth in Rule 501(a)
of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.501(a)] and includes any person who comes within one of the definition’s
enumerated categories of persons, or whom the issuer “reasonably believes” comes within any of the
enumerated categories, at the time of the sale of the securities to that person. For natural persons, Rule
502(a) defines an accredited investor as a person: (1) whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with
that person’s spouse, exceeds $1 million, excluding the value of the person’s primary residence (the “net
worth test”); or (2) who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most recent
years, or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years, and has a
reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year (the “income test”).
Although the Dodd-Frank Act did not change the amount of the $1 million net worth test, it did change
how that amount is calculated – by excluding the value of a person’s primary residence. This change took
effect upon the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. In December 2011, we amended Rule 501 to incorporate
this change into the definition of accredited investor. See Net Worth Standard for Accredited Investors,
Release No. 33-9287 (Dec. 21, 2011) [76 FR 81793 (Dec. 29, 2011)].
18

17 CFR 230.144A(d)(1).

19

The term “qualified institutional buyer” is defined in Rule 144A(a)(1) [17 CFR 230.144A(a)(1)] and
includes specified institutions that, in the aggregate, own and invest on a discretionary basis at least $100
million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with such institutions. Banks and other specified
financial institutions must also have a net worth of at least $25 million. A registered broker-dealer qualifies
as a QIB if it, in the aggregate, owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $10 million in securities of
issuers that are not affiliated with the broker-dealer.

of general solicitation or general advertising, provided that the securities are sold only to
persons that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe are
QIBs.
The Commission originally adopted Rule 506 as a non-exclusive safe harbor
under Section 4(a)(2) (formerly Section 4(2)) of the Securities Act, 20 which exempts
transactions by an issuer “not involving any public offering” from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act. 21 Under existing Rule 506, an issuer
may sell securities, without any limitation on the offering amount, to an unlimited
number of “accredited investors,” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, and to no
more than 35 non-accredited investors who meet certain “sophistication” requirements. 22
The availability of Rule 506 is subject to a number of requirements 23 and is currently
conditioned on the issuer, or any person acting on its behalf, not offering or selling
securities through any form of “general solicitation or general advertising.” 24 Although
the terms “general solicitation” and “general advertising” are not defined in Regulation
D, Rule 502(c) does provide examples of general solicitation and general advertising,
including advertisements published in newspapers and magazines, communications
broadcast over television and radio, and seminars where attendees have been invited by
20

15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(2).

15 U.S.C. 77e.

22

Under Rule 506(b)(2)(ii) [17 CFR 230.506(b)(2)(ii)], each purchaser in a Rule 506 offering who is not
an accredited investor must possess, or the issuer must reasonably believe immediately before the sale of
securities that such purchaser possesses, either alone or with his or her purchaser representative, “such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he [or she] is capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of the prospective investment.”
23

Offerings under Rule 506 are subject to all the terms and conditions of Rules 501 and 502. If securities
are sold to any non-accredited investors, specified information requirements apply. See Rule 502(b) [17
CFR 230.502(b)].
24

Rule 502(c) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.502(c)].

general solicitation or general advertising. 25 By interpretation, the Commission has
confirmed that other uses of publicly available media, such as unrestricted websites, also
constitute general solicitation and general advertising. 26 In this release, we refer to both
general solicitation and general advertising as “general solicitation.”
Rule 144A is a non-exclusive safe harbor exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act for resales of certain “restricted securities” 27 to QIBs.
Resales to QIBs in accordance with the conditions of Rule 144A 28 are exempt from
registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(1) (formerly Section 4(1)) of the Securities Act, 29
which exempts transactions by any person “other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer.”
Although Rule 144A does not include an express prohibition against general solicitation,
offers of securities under Rule 144A currently must be limited to QIBs, which has the
same practical effect. By its terms, Rule 144A is available solely for resale transactions;
however, since its adoption by the Commission in 1990, 30 market participants have used

25851-52 (May 4, 2000)].
27
“Restricted securities” are defined in Securities Act Rule 144(a)(3) [17 CFR 230.144(a)(3)] to include,
in part, “[s]ecurities acquired directly or indirectly from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, in a
transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering.”
28

In order for a transaction to come within existing Rule 144A, a seller must have a reasonable basis for
believing that the offeree or purchaser is a QIB and must take reasonable steps to ensure that the purchaser
is aware that the seller may rely on Rule 144A. Further, only securities that were not, when issued, of the
same class as securities listed on a U.S. securities exchange or quoted on a U.S. automated interdealer
quotation system are eligible for resale under Rule 144A. Also, the seller and a prospective purchaser
designated by the seller must have the right to obtain from the issuer, upon request, certain information on
the issuer, unless the issuer falls within specified categories as to which this condition does not apply.

Rule 144A to facilitate capital-raising by issuers. 31 The term “Rule 144A offering” in
this release refers to a primary offering of securities by an issuer to one or more financial
intermediaries – commonly known as the “initial purchasers” – in a transaction that is
exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) or Regulation S under the Securities
Act, 32 followed by the resale of those securities by the initial purchasers to QIBs in
reliance on Rule 144A.
Rule 506 offerings and Rule 144A offerings are widely used by U.S. and nonU.S. issuers to raise capital. In 2012, the estimated amount of capital (including both
equity and debt) reported as being raised in Rule 506 offerings and non-asset-backed
securities (“non-ABS”) Rule 144A offerings by operating companies was $173 billion
and $636 billion, respectively, and by pooled investment funds, such as venture capital
funds, private equity funds and hedge funds, was $725 billion and $4 billion,
respectively, compared to $1.2 trillion raised in registered offerings. 33 In 2011, the
31

While Rule 144A applies to resales of securities of both U.S. and non-U.S. issuers, one of the objectives
of Rule 144A was to make primary offerings of non-U.S. issuers’ securities available to U.S. institutions in
the U.S. market through intermediaries (rather than compelling such investors to go to overseas markets) by
making the private offering market in the United States more attractive to non-U.S. issuers. See Resale of
Restricted Securities; Changes to Method of Determining Holding Period of Restricted Securities Under
Rules 144 and 145, Release No. 33-6806 (Oct. 25, 1988) [53 FR 44016 (Nov. 1, 1988)].
32

Regulation S under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.901 through 230.905] was adopted in 1990 as a safe
harbor from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for any offer or sale of securities made
outside the United States. It provides that any “offer,” “offer to sell,” “sell,” “sale” or “offer to buy” that
occurs outside the United States is not subject to the registration requirements of Section 5. Regulation S
does not affect the scope or availability of the antifraud or other provisions of the Securities Act to offers
and sales made in reliance on Regulation S.
33

These statistics are based on a review of Form D electronic filings with the Commission – specifically,
the “total amount sold” as reported in the filings – and data regarding other types of offerings (e.g., public
debt offerings and Rule 144A offerings) from Securities Data Corporation’s New Issues database
(Thomson Financial). See Vladimir Ivanov and Scott Bauguess, Capital Raising in the U.S.: An Analysis
of Unregistered Offerings Using the Regulation D Exemption, 2009-2012 (July 2013) (the
“Ivanov/Bauguess Study”), available at: http://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/whitepapers/deraunregistered-offerings-reg-d.pdf. For non-ABS Rule 144A offerings, since the databases we used to obtain
the Rule 144A data do not distinguish between operating companies and funds, we classified issuers with
SIC codes between 6200 and 6299 as funds, and the rest as operating companies.

8

estimated amount of capital (including both equity and debt) reported as being raised in
Rule 506 offerings and non-ABS Rule 144A offerings by operating companies was $71
billion and $438 billion, respectively, and by pooled investment funds was $778 billion
and $4 billion, respectively, compared to $985 billion raised in registered offerings. 34
These data points underscore the importance of the Rule 506 and Rule 144A exemptions
for issuers seeking access to the U.S. capital markets.
To implement Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act, we proposed amending Rule 506
to add new paragraph (c), under which the prohibition against general solicitation
contained in Rule 502(c) would not apply, provided that all purchasers of the securities
are accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify that such
purchasers are accredited investors. In addition, we proposed amending Form D, which
is a notice required to be filed with the Commission by each issuer claiming a Regulation
D exemption, to add a check box to indicate whether an issuer is claiming an exemption
under Rule 506(c). We also proposed an amendment to Rule 144A to provide that
securities sold pursuant to Rule 144A may be offered to persons other than QIBs,
including by means of general solicitation, provided that the securities are sold only to
persons that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe are
QIBs.
The amount of capital raised through offerings under Regulation D may be larger than what is reported in
Form D filings because, although the filing of a Form D is a requirement of Rule 503(a) of Regulation D
[17 CFR 230.503(a)], it is not a condition to the availability of the exemptions under Regulation D.
Further, once a Form D is filed, the issuer is not required to file an amendment to the filing to reflect a
change that occurs after the offering terminates or a change that occurs solely with respect to certain
information, such as the amount sold in the offering. For example, if the amount sold does not result in an
increase in the total offering amount of more than 10% or the offering closes within a year, the filing of an
amendment to the initial Form D is not required. Therefore, a Form D filed for a particular offering may
not reflect the total amount of securities sold in the offering in reliance on the exemption.

The comment period for the proposed rule and form amendments closed on
October 5, 2012. We received over 225 comment letters on the Proposing Release,
including from professional and trade associations, investor organizations, law firms,
investment companies and investment advisers, members of Congress, the Commission’s
Investor Advisory Committee, 35 state securities regulators, issuers, individuals and other
interested parties. Most of the comment letters focused on the proposed amendments to
Rule 506. As discussed below, commenters were sharply divided in their views on the
proposed amendments to Rule 506, whereas commenters generally supported the
proposed amendments to Rule 144A and Form D.
We have reviewed and considered all of the comments that we received on the
proposed rule and form amendments and on Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act. 36 We are
adopting new paragraph (c) to Rule 506 as proposed, with one modification, and the
amendments to Form D and to Rule 144A as proposed. We are also adopting the
technical and conforming rule amendments as proposed. We discuss these amendments
in detail below.
35

The SEC Investor Advisory Committee (“Investor Advisory Committee”) was established in April 2012
pursuant to Section 911 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act [Pub. L. No.
111-203, sec. 911, 124 Stat. 1376, 1822 (July 21, 2010)] (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) to advise the
Commission on regulatory priorities, the regulation of securities products, trading strategies, fee structures,
the effectiveness of disclosure, initiatives to protect investor interests and to promote investor confidence
and the integrity of the securities marketplace. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Investor Advisory
Committee to submit findings and recommendations for review and consideration by the Commission.
36

To facilitate public input on JOBS Act rulemaking before the issuance of rule proposals, the
Commission invited members of the public to make their views known on various JOBS Act initiatives in
advance of any rulemaking by submitting comment letters to the Commission’s website at
http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobsactcomments.shtml. The comment letters relating to Section 201(a) of
the JOBS Act submitted in response to this invitation are located at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobstitle-ii/jobs-title-ii.shtml. The comment letters submitted in response to the Proposing Release are located
at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-07-12/s70712.shtml. Many commenters submitted comment letters
both before and after the issuance of the Proposing Release. Dated comment letters refer to those
submitted before the issuance of the Proposing Release or by commenters that submitted multiple letters.

10

We acknowledge the concerns of some commenters that the elimination of the
prohibition against general solicitation for a subset of Rule 506 offerings may affect the
behavior of issuers and other market participants in ways they believe could compromise
investor protection. 37 Preserving the integrity of the Rule 506(c) market and minimizing
the incidence of fraud are critical objectives for the Commission in implementing Section
201(a) of the JOBS Act. We are adopting today the bad actor disqualification for Rule
506 offerings mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, which may address some of those
concerns. 38 We are also issuing a proposing release to amend Regulation D and Form D
to enhance the Commission’s ability to analyze the Rule 506 market and to amend Rule
156 under the Securities Act to provide guidance to private funds on the application of
the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws to their sales literature. 39 Upon the
effectiveness of Rule 506(c), the Commission staff will monitor developments in the
market for Rule 506(c) offerings so as to be able to undertake a review of market
practices in Rule 506(c) offerings, including the steps taken by issuers and other market
participants to verify that the purchasers of the offered securities are accredited investors,
as well as the impact of the amendments to Rule 506 on capital formation.
II.

FINAL AMENDMENTS TO RULE 506 AND FORM D
A.

Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation

Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act exempts transactions by an issuer “not
involving any public offering.” An issuer relying on Section 4(a)(2) is restricted in its
37

See, e.g., letters from Investor Advisory Committee; North American Securities Administrators
Association, Inc. (“NASAA”); Consumer Federation of America (“Consumer Federation”).

10, 2013) (the “Bad Actor Release”).
39

See Amendments to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156, Release No. 33-9416 (July 10, 2013).

11

ability to make public communications to attract investors for its offering because public
advertising is incompatible with a claim of exemption under Section 4(a)(2). 40 As noted
above, Rule 506 currently conditions the availability of the safe harbor under Section
4(a)(2) on the issuer, or any person acting on its behalf, not offering or selling securities
through any form of general solicitation. 41 Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act directs the
Commission to amend Rule 506 to provide that the prohibition against general
solicitation contained in Rule 502(c) shall not apply to offers and sales of securities made
pursuant to Rule 506, as so amended, provided that all purchasers of the securities are
accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify their status as
accredited investors.
This mandate affects only Rule 506, and not Section 4(a)(2) offerings in
general, 42 which means that even after the effective date of Rule 506(c), an issuer relying
on Section 4(a)(2) outside of the Rule 506(c) exemption will be restricted in its ability to
make public communications to solicit investors for its offering because public
advertising will continue to be incompatible with a claim of exemption under Section

40

See Non-Public Offering Exemption, Release No. 33-4552 (Nov. 6, 1962) [27 FR 11316 (Nov. 16,
1962)].
41

See Rule 502(c) and Rule 506(b)(1) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.506(b)(1)]. The failure to comply
with Rule 502(c) is deemed to be significant to the offering as a whole, which means that an issuer cannot
rely on the “insignificant deviation” relief in Rule 508 of Regulation D for violations of Rule 502(c). See
Rule 508(a)(2) [17 CFR 230.508(a)(2)].
42

In this regard, we also note that bills that would have amended Section 4(a)(2) directly, rather than
requiring the Commission to amend Rule 506, to permit the use of general solicitation were introduced and
considered by Congress, but were not enacted. See Access to Capital for Job Creators, H.R. 2940, 112th
Cong., 1st Sess. (2011) (proposing to amend Section 4(a)(2) by adding the phrase “whether or not such
transactions involve general solicitation or general advertising”); Access to Capital for Job Creators,
S.1831, 112th Cong., 1st Sess. (2011) (same).

12

4(a)(2). We are amending Rule 500(c) of Regulation D accordingly to make this clear. 43
Congress’ directive in Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act, and not Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act or our interpretation of Section 4(a)(2), is the reason that Rule 506, “as
revised pursuant to [Section 201(a)(1)], shall continue to be treated as a regulation issued
under section 4[(a)](2) of the Securities Act of 1933” (emphasis added). 44 Similarly,
securities issued in Rule 506(c) offerings are deemed to be “covered securities” for
purposes of Section 18(b)(4)(E) of the Securities Act, 45 only by virtue of Section
201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act.
1.

Proposed Rule Amendment

To implement the mandated rule change, we proposed new Rule 506(c), which
would permit the use of general solicitation to offer and sell securities under Rule 506,
provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
•

all terms and conditions of Rule 501 46 and Rules 502(a) 47 and 502(d) 48 must
be satisfied;

43

As revised, Rule 500(c) reads as follows: “Attempted compliance with any rule in Regulation D does
not act as an exclusive election; the issuer can also claim the availability of any other applicable exemption.
For instance, an issuer’s failure to satisfy all the terms and conditions of rule 506(b) (§230.506(b)) shall not
raise any presumption that the exemption provided by section 4(a)(2) of the Act is not available.”
(additions italicized).
44

Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act.

45

15 U.S.C. 77r(b)(4)(E). This means that state blue sky registration requirements do not apply to
securities offered or sold in Rule 506(c) offerings.
46

Rule 501 sets forth definitions for the terms used in Regulation D, such as “accredited investor.”

47

Rule 502(a) addresses the question of integration by providing a six-month safe harbor from integration
for successive Regulation D offerings and a five-factor framework to apply in cases in which the six-month
safe harbor is not available.
48

Rule 502(d) provides that, for resale purposes, securities acquired in a Regulation D offering, except as
provided in Rule 504(b)(1), have the status of securities acquired in a transaction under Section 4(a)(2) of
the Securities Act. Rule 144(a)(3)(ii) [17 CFR 230.144(a)(3)(ii)] defines “restricted securities” as securities
“acquired from the issuer that are subject to the resale limitations of §230.502(d) under Regulation D….”

13

•

all purchasers of securities must be accredited investors; and

•

the issuer must take reasonable steps to verify that the purchasers of the
securities are accredited investors.

Offerings under proposed Rule 506(c) would not be subject to the requirement to comply
with Rule 502(c), which contains the prohibition against general solicitation. While we
proposed Rule 506(c) to enable issuers to use general solicitation in Rule 506 offerings,
we also preserved, in current Rule 506(b), the existing ability of issuers to conduct Rule
506 offerings subject to the prohibition against general solicitation.

Comments on the Proposed Rule Amendment

Commenters were sharply divided in their views on the proposed amendment to
Rule 506. Commenters who supported the proposed amendment to Rule 506 stated that
Rule 506(c), if adopted, would assist issuers, particularly early stage and smaller issuers,
in raising capital by allowing them to solicit investments from a larger pool of
investors. 49 These commenters generally approved of the flexibility afforded by the
manner in which we proposed to implement Rule 506(c)’s verification requirement, 50 as

Separately, Section 201(b) of the JOBS Act added Section 4(b) of the Securities Act, which provides that
“[o]ffers and sales exempt under [Rule 506 as amended pursuant to Section 201 of the JOBS Act] shall not
be deemed public offerings under the Federal securities laws as a result of general advertising or general
solicitation.” Thus, securities acquired under new Rule 506(c) would also meet the definition of “restricted
securities” under Rule 144(a)(3)(i) [17 CFR 230.144(a)(3)(i)] (“[s]ecurities acquired directly or indirectly
from the issuer, or from an affiliate of the issuer, in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any
public offering”).

under existing Rule 506(b) to conduct Rule 506 offerings subject to the prohibition
against general solicitation. 51 A number of commenters stated that they supported the
availability of Rule 506(c) for private funds pursuant to the Commission’s guidance in
the Proposing Release. 52
Other commenters opposed the proposed amendment to Rule 506 in its entirety or
in part. Many of these commenters expressed concern that the proposed amendment, if
adopted, would increase the risk of fraudulent and abusive Rule 506 offerings and
asserted that additional investor safeguards are necessary under Rule 506(c). 53 A number
of these commenters urged the Commission to adopt rules concerning bad actor
disqualifications for Rule 506 offerings, as required by Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank
Act. 54 Other commenters recommended that the Commission amend the definition of
“accredited investor” by raising the income and net worth thresholds for natural persons

or by implementing other measures of financial sophistication. 55 Some commenters
stated that the Commission should condition the availability of the Rule 506(c)
exemption on the filing of Form D or require the advance filing of Form D, or both. 56
Other commenters argued that the Commission should adopt specific standards or
requirements that would govern the content and/or manner of general solicitations in Rule
506(c) offerings, particularly with respect to advertising by private funds. 57 A number of
commenters urged the Commission to require that the materials used to generally solicit
investors in Rule 506(c) offerings be filed with or furnished to either the Commission or
to FINRA. 58
A number of commenters requested that the Commission provide transitional
guidance with respect to ongoing offerings under existing Rule 506 that commenced
before the effectiveness of Rule 506(c). 59 For example, in some situations, the initial
closings in these offerings may have already occurred, and could have included nonaccredited investors pursuant to offering procedures that would not have involved any
form of general solicitation. 60 Several commenters suggested that the Commission
clarify that an issuer would be entitled to conduct the portion of the offering following

the effectiveness of Rule 506(c) in accordance with the requirements of new Rule 506(c),
without the portion of the offering occurring after the rule’s effectiveness affecting the
portion of the offering that was completed prior to the rule’s effectiveness. 61
3.

Final Rule Amendment

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 506(c) as proposed, with
one modification. Under new Rule 506(c), issuers can offer securities through means of
general solicitation, provided that they satisfy all of the conditions of the exemption. 62
These conditions are:
•

all terms and conditions of Rule 501 and Rules 502(a) and 502(d) must be
satisfied; 63

•

all purchasers of securities must be accredited investors; 64 and

•

the issuer must take reasonable steps to verify that the purchasers of the
securities are accredited investors. 65

Issuers relying on Rule 506(c) for their offerings will not be subject to the prohibition
against general solicitation found in Rule 502(c). 66 In addition and as further discussed
61

See letters from ABA Fed. Reg. Comm.; S&C (stating that “[w]e believe that such issuers should be
allowed, upon effectiveness of the final rule, to use the new Rule 506(c) exemption and use general
solicitation for the remaining portion of their offerings, provided that they satisfy the requirements of Rule
506(c) going forward.”).
62

We also note that broker-dealers participating in offerings in conjunction with issuers relying on Rule
506(c) would continue to be subject to FINRA rules regarding communications with the public, which,
among other things, (1) generally require all member communications to be based on principles of fair
dealing and good faith, to be fair and balanced, and to provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts in
regard to any particular security or type of security, industry or service; and (2) prohibit broker-dealers
from making false, exaggerated, unwarranted, promissory or misleading statements or claims in any
communications. See FINRA Rule 2210.

below, in response to comments from a wide range of commenters asking for greater
certainty with respect to satisfying the verification requirement, we are also including in
Rule 506(c) a non-exclusive list of methods that issuers may use to verify the accredited
investor status of natural persons.
Issuers will continue to have the ability under Rule 506(b) to conduct Rule 506
offerings subject to the prohibition against general solicitation. As we noted in the
Proposing Release, offerings under existing Rule 506(b) represent an important source of
capital for issuers of all sizes, and we believe that the continued availability of existing
Rule 506(b) will be important for those issuers that either do not wish to engage in
general solicitation in their Rule 506 offerings (and become subject to the requirement to
take reasonable steps to verify the accredited investor status of purchasers) or wish to sell
privately to non-accredited investors who meet Rule 506(b)’s sophistication
requirements. Retaining the safe harbor under existing Rule 506(b) may also be
beneficial to investors with whom an issuer has a pre-existing substantive relationship. 67
In this regard, we do not believe that Section 201(a) requires the Commission to modify
Rule 506 to impose any new requirements on offers and sales of securities that do not
involve general solicitation. Therefore, the amendment to Rule 506 we are adopting
today does not amend or modify the requirements relating to existing Rule 506(b).

66

Offerings under Rule 506(c) will also not be subject to the information requirements in Rule 502(b) for
non-accredited investors, because all purchasers in Rule 506(c) offerings are required to be accredited
investors.

67

See Release No. 33-7856, at 25852 (noting that “one method of ensuring that general solicitation is not
involved is to establish the existence of a ‘pre-existing, substantive relationship’” and that “there may be
facts and circumstances in which a third party, other than a registered broker-dealer, could established a
‘pre-existing, substantive relationship’ sufficient to avoid a ‘general solicitation’”).

18

Finally, with respect to transition matters, for an ongoing offering under Rule 506
that commenced before the effective date of Rule 506(c), the issuer may choose to
continue the offering after the effective date in accordance with the requirements of either
Rule 506(b) or Rule 506(c). If an issuer chooses to continue the offering in accordance
with the requirements of Rule 506(c), any general solicitation that occurs after the
effective date will not affect the exempt status of offers and sales of securities that
occurred prior to the effective date in reliance on Rule 506(b).
B.

Reasonable Steps to Verify Accredited Investor Status

Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act mandates that our amendment to Rule 506
require issuers using general solicitation in Rule 506 offerings “to take reasonable steps
to verify that purchasers of the securities are accredited investors, using such methods as
determined by the Commission.” As noted in the Proposing Release, we believe that the
purpose of the verification mandate is to address concerns, and reduce the risk, that the
use of general solicitation in Rule 506 offerings could result in sales of securities to
investors who are not, in fact, accredited investors. 68
1.

Proposed Rule Amendment

To implement the verification mandate of Section 201(a)(1), we proposed to
condition the Rule 506(c) exemption on the requirement that issuers using general
solicitation “take reasonable steps to verify” that the purchasers of the offered securities
are accredited investors. As proposed, whether the steps taken are “reasonable” would be
68

See, e.g., Markup of H.R. 2940, Access to Capital for Job Creators Act, Subcommittee on Capital
Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, House Financial Services Committee, 112th Cong. (Oct.
5, 2011) (remarks of Rep. Waters, explaining that she is introducing the amendment that requires issuers to
take reasonable steps to verify accredited investor status because “we must take steps to ensure that those
folks are indeed sophisticated”); 157 Cong. Rec. H7291 (daily ed. Nov. 3, 2011) (remarks of Rep. Maloney
(same)); 157 Cong. Rec. H7294 (daily ed. Nov. 3, 2011) (remarks of Rep. Lee (same)).

19

an objective determination by the issuer (or those acting on its behalf), in the context of
the particular facts and circumstances of each purchaser and transaction. Under this
principles-based approach, issuers would consider a number of factors when determining
the reasonableness of the steps to verify that a purchaser is an accredited investor, such
as:
•

the nature of the purchaser and the type of accredited investor that the
purchaser claims to be;

•

the amount and type of information that the issuer has about the purchaser;
and

•

the nature of the offering, such as the manner in which the purchaser was
solicited to participate in the offering, and the terms of the offering, such as a
minimum investment amount.

These factors would be interconnected, and the information gained by looking at these
factors would help an issuer assess the reasonable likelihood that a potential purchaser is
an accredited investor, which would, in turn, affect the types of steps that would be
reasonable to take to verify a purchaser’s accredited investor status.
In the Proposing Release, we considered providing a list of specified methods for
satisfying the verification requirement, which was suggested by some commenters on
Section 201(a) prior to the issuance of the Proposing Release. 69 We expressed concern
69

See letters from MFA (June 26, 2012) (suggesting that the Commission publish a non-exclusive list of
the types of third-party evidence that an investor could provide to establish accredited investor status, in
conjunction with certifying that he or she is an accredited investor); NASAA (July 3, 2012) (recommending
that the Commission set forth non-exclusive safe harbors to specify the types of actions that would be
deemed “reasonable steps to verify” for three types of accredited investors: natural persons who purport to
satisfy the income test; natural persons who purport to satisfy the net worth test; and entities who purport to
meet one of the other tests set forth in Rule 501(a)).

20

that, in designating such a list – for example, by setting forth particular types of
information that issuers may rely upon as conclusive means of verifying accredited
investor status – there may be circumstances where such information will not actually
verify accredited investor status or where issuers may unreasonably overlook or disregard
other information indicating that a purchaser is not, in fact, an accredited investor. Also,
we were concerned that requiring issuers to use specified methods of verification would
be impractical, burdensome and potentially ineffective in light of the numerous ways in
which a purchaser can qualify as an accredited investor, as well as the potentially wide
range of verification issues that may arise, depending on the nature of the purchaser and
the facts and circumstances of a particular Rule 506(c) offering. Even if the list of
specified methods was not mandatory, but rather, constituted a non-exclusive list, we
were concerned that a non-exclusive list of specified methods could be viewed by market
participants as, in effect, required methods, in which compliance with at least one of the
enumerated methods could be viewed as necessary in all circumstances to demonstrate
that the verification requirement has been satisfied, thereby eliminating the flexibility that
proposed Rule 506(c) was intended to provide.
We requested comment in the Proposing Release on our proposed principlesbased method and its effectiveness in limiting sales of securities in Rule 506(c) offerings
to only accredited investors. We also requested comment on possible alternative
approaches for implementing the verification mandate of Section 201(a)(1), such as a rule
that specifies mandatory methods for verifying accredited investor status or a nonexclusive list of verification methods that would function as a safe harbor for compliance
with the verification requirement.

Comments on the Proposed Rule Amendment

Commenters expressed a wide range of views on the proposed approach to the
verification requirement in Rule 506(c). Some commenters commended the Commission
for proposing a flexible, principles-based standard for verification. 70 For example, one
commenter stated that the Commission’s proposed approach would provide issuers with
the flexibility to develop tailored, reliable and cost-effective procedures for verification. 71
A number of commenters stated that the discussion in the Proposing Release of the
factors that issuers may take into account in verifying accredited investor status would
assist issuers in assessing the reasonableness of their verification processes. 72 Other
commenters asserted that not requiring issuers to use certain specified methods to verify a
purchaser’s accredited investor status would permit advancements in verification
methods over time. 73 Some commenters expressed support for the Commission’s
proposal that accredited investor status may be verified through an attestation or
certification by a third party, provided that the issuer has a reasonable basis to rely on
such third-party verification. 74

See, e.g., letters from IAA; SIFMA and FSR (Oct. 5, 2012); Tannenbaum Helpern Syracuse &

issuer. See, e.g., letters from L. Neumann; NSBA. One commenter urged the Commission not to limit
third-party verification providers to certain types of entities. See letter from Tannenbaum Helpern. One
commenter suggested the possibility of requiring investors to self-certify as to accredited investor status
under penalty of perjury. See letter from NSBA.

22

Other commenters opposed the Commission’s proposed approach, for various
reasons. A number of these commenters opposed the proposed verification standard
because, in their view, self-certification by itself should be sufficient to satisfy the
verification requirement. 75 Some commenters opposed the proposed verification
standard because it did not prescribe specific verification methods, which they believed is
required in order to satisfy the verification mandate in Section 201(a). 76 One commenter
stated that the Commission should deem the verification requirement to be satisfied if all
purchasers in a Rule 506(c) offering are in fact accredited investors. 77 Another
commenter stated that verification of accredited investor status should not be a condition
of the Rule 506(c) exemption when the purchaser is actually an accredited investor. 78
Commenters expressed differing views on whether the Commission should
include a non-exclusive list of methods in proposed Rule 506(c) for satisfying the
verification requirement. Many commenters, encompassing a wide range of perspectives
(e.g., state government officials, law firms, investor organizations, professional and trade
associations, and individuals), urged the Commission to provide such a non-exclusive
list. 79 A number of these commenters cited the lack of legal certainty that the verification

requirement has been satisfied in any given situation as the reason why, in their view, the
Commission should include a non-exclusive list of verification methods in Rule 506(c). 80
In contrast, other commenters stated that the Commission should not include a nonexclusive list of verification methods in Rule 506(c), arguing that such a list could be
viewed by market participants as the required verification methods, which would thereby
undermine the flexibility of the Commission’s proposed approach. 81
If there were to be a non-exclusive list of verification methods, commenters
expressed a range of views on what should be included in such a list, such as verification
by certain third parties or through tax returns and third-party documentary proof such as
Forms W-2, Forms 1099, bank statements, brokerage account statements, tax assessment
valuations and appraisal reports. 82 With respect to the types of third parties that could
provide verification services, commenters named registered brokers-dealers, 83 banks and
other financial institutions, 84 registered investment advisers, 85 certified financial
planners, 86 attorneys, 87 and accountants. 88 Other commenters suggested including in a

In contrast, one commenter argued that the ability to satisfy a minimum
investment amount would not necessarily mean a person is an accredited investor, but
rather, that the investor could be “over-concentrated in the investment.” 94 Another
commenter stated that the verification requirement should not be deemed satisfied simply
because an issuer possesses general information about the average compensation in the
investor’s profession or workplace. 95
Several commenters stated that there should be a “grandfather” provision from the
verification mandate for an issuer’s existing investors who purchased securities in a Rule
506(b) offering prior to the effective date of Rule 506(c), 96 and one commenter proposed
to limit the scope of any grandfather provision to only existing accredited investors. 97

Two of these commenters reasoned that, as issuers are prohibited from engaging in
general solicitation activities in Rule 506(b) offerings, their existing investors did not
purchase securities in offerings that used general solicitation, and any future investments
by these investors would be based on their pre-existing relationship with the issuers, and
not as a result of general solicitation. 98 Therefore, a grandfather provision would be
appropriate because the purpose of the verification mandate in Section 201(a) of the
JOBS Act is to require the verification of the accredited investor status of only
prospective purchasers who come to the issuer “as a result of” the issuer’s general
solicitation activities. 99 One commenter stated that, for existing investors, a
“reaffirmation representation” of accredited investor status received shortly before or
simultaneously with any subsequent investment should be sufficient for Rule 506(c)
purposes. 100
3.

Final Rule Amendment

After considering the comments and as directed by Section 201(a) of the JOBS
Act, we are adopting as a condition of new Rule 506(c) the requirement that issuers take
“reasonable steps to verify” that purchasers of the offered securities are accredited
investors. This requirement is separate from and independent of the requirement that
sales be limited to accredited investors, and must be satisfied even if all purchasers
happen to be accredited investors. 101 We are also including in Rule 506(c) a non-

101

This will avoid diminishing the incentive for issuers to undertake the reasonable verification steps
envisioned by the statute.

26

exclusive list of methods that issuers may use to satisfy the verification requirement. As
discussed above, a number of commenters urged the Commission to provide greater
certainty for issuers that the verification requirement has been satisfied by providing a
non-exclusive list of methods for verifying the accredited investor status of purchasers in
Rule 506(c) offerings. Upon further consideration, we have concluded that a general
requirement that issuers take “reasonable steps to verify” that the purchasers are
accredited investors, combined with a non-exclusive list of verification methods that are
deemed to meet this requirement, would maintain the flexibility of the verification
standard while providing additional clarity and certainty that this requirement has been
satisfied if one of the specified methods is used. We have specified methods for
verifying the accredited investor status of natural persons because we believe that the
potential for uncertainty and the risk of participation by non-accredited investors is
highest in offerings involving natural persons as purchasers.
a.

Principles-Based Method of Verification

Under Rule 506(c), issuers are required to take reasonable steps to verify the
accredited investor status of purchasers. Consistent with the Proposing Release, whether
the steps taken are “reasonable” will be an objective determination by the issuer (or those
acting on its behalf), in the context of the particular facts and circumstances of each
purchaser and transaction. Among the factors that issuers should consider under this
facts and circumstances analysis are:
•

the nature of the purchaser and the type of accredited investor that the
purchaser claims to be;

•

the amount and type of information that the issuer has about the purchaser;
and
27

•

the nature of the offering, such as the manner in which the purchaser was
solicited to participate in the offering, and the terms of the offering, such as a
minimum investment amount.

As noted in the Proposing Release, these factors are interconnected and are
intended to help guide an issuer in assessing the reasonable likelihood that a purchaser is
an accredited investor – which would, in turn, affect the types of steps that would be
reasonable to take to verify a purchaser’s accredited investor status. After consideration
of the facts and circumstances of the purchaser and of the transaction, the more likely it
appears that a purchaser qualifies as an accredited investor, the fewer steps the issuer
would have to take to verify accredited investor status, and vice versa. For example, if
the terms of the offering require a high minimum investment amount and a purchaser is
able to meet those terms, then the likelihood of that purchaser satisfying the definition of
accredited investor may be sufficiently high such that, absent any facts that indicate that
the purchaser is not an accredited investor, it may be reasonable for the issuer to take
fewer steps to verify or, in certain cases, no additional steps to verify accredited investor
status other than to confirm that the purchaser’s cash investment is not being financed by
a third party.
Regardless of the particular steps taken, because the issuer has the burden of
demonstrating that its offering is entitled to an exemption from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act, 102 it will be important for issuers and

federal securities legislation, imposition of the burden of proof on an issuer who would plead the exemption
seems to us fair and reasonable.”).

28

their verification service providers to retain adequate records regarding the steps taken to
verify that a purchaser was an accredited investor.
Nature of the Purchaser. In determining the reasonableness of the steps to verify
accredited investor status, an issuer should consider the nature of the purchaser of the
offered securities. The definition of “accredited investor” in Rule 501(a) includes natural
persons and entities that come within any of eight enumerated categories in the rule, or
that the issuer reasonably believes come within one of those categories, at the time of the
sale of securities to that natural person or entity. Some purchasers may be accredited
investors based on their status, such as:
•

a broker or dealer registered pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”); 103 or

•

an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) or a business development company as
defined in Section 2(a)(48) of that Act. 104

Some purchasers may be accredited investors based on a combination of their status and
the amount of their total assets, such as:
•

a plan established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or its political subdivisions, for the benefit
of its employees, if such plan has total assets in excess of $5 million; 105 or

103

See 17 CFR 230.501(a)(1).

104

See id.

105

See id.

29

•

an Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 501(c)(3) organization,
corporation, Massachusetts or similar business trust, or partnership, not
formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities offered, with total
assets in excess of $5 million. 106

Natural persons may be accredited investors based on either their net worth or their
annual income, as follows:
•

a natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that
person’s spouse, exceeds $1 million, excluding the value of the person’s
primary residence; 107 or

•

a natural person who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each
of the two most recent years, or joint income with that person’s spouse in
excess of $300,000 in each of those years, and has a reasonable expectation of
reaching the same income level in the current year. 108

As Rule 501(a) sets forth different categories of accredited investors, an issuer
should recognize that the steps that will be reasonable to verify whether a purchaser is an
accredited investor will vary depending on the type of accredited investor that the
purchaser claims to be. For example, the steps that may be reasonable to verify that an
entity is an accredited investor by virtue of being a registered broker-dealer – such as by
going to FINRA’s BrokerCheck website 109 – will necessarily differ from the steps that
may be reasonable to verify whether a natural person is an accredited investor.

As we stated in the Proposing Release, the verification of natural persons as
accredited investors may pose greater practical difficulties as compared to other
categories of accredited investors, particularly for natural persons claiming to be
accredited investors based on the net worth test. These practical difficulties likely will be
exacerbated by privacy concerns about the disclosure of personal financial information.
As between the net worth test and the income test for natural persons, we recognize that
commenters have suggested that it might be more difficult for an issuer to obtain
information about the assets and liabilities that determine a person’s net worth –
particularly the liabilities – than it would be to obtain information about a person’s annual
income, 110 although there could be privacy concerns with respect to either test. The
question of what type of information would be sufficient to constitute reasonable steps to
verify accredited investor status under the particular facts and circumstances will also
depend on other factors, as described below.
Information about the Purchaser. The amount and type of information that an
issuer has about a purchaser can also be a significant factor in determining what
additional steps would be reasonable to take to verify the purchaser’s accredited investor
status. The more information an issuer has indicating that a prospective purchaser is an
accredited investor, the fewer steps it may have to take, and vice versa. 111 Examples of
the types of information that issuers could review or rely upon – any of which might,

110

individual could provide proof of assets but not liabilities.”); P. Sigelman (Sept. 28, 2012).

If an issuer has actual knowledge that the purchaser is an accredited investor, then the issuer will not
have to take any steps at all.

depending on the circumstances, in and of themselves constitute reasonable steps to
verify a purchaser’s accredited investor status – include, without limitation:
•

publicly available information in filings with a federal, state or local
regulatory body – for example, without limitation:
o

the purchaser is a named executive officer of an Exchange Act registrant,
and the registrant’s proxy statement discloses the purchaser’s
compensation; or

o

the purchaser claims to be an IRC Section 501(c)(3) organization with $5
million in assets, and the organization’s Form 990 series return filed with
the Internal Revenue Service discloses the organization’s total assets; 112

•

third-party information that provides reasonably reliable evidence that a
person falls within one of the enumerated categories in the accredited investor
definition – for example, without limitation:
o the purchaser is a natural person and provides copies of pay stubs for the
two most recent years and the current year; or
o specific information about the average compensation earned at the
purchaser’s workplace by persons at the level of the purchaser’s seniority
is publicly available; or

112

Such an organization is required to make the Form 990 series returns available for public inspection.

•

verification of a person’s status as an accredited investor by a third party,
provided that the issuer has a reasonable basis to rely on such third-party
verification. 113

Nature and Terms of the Offering. The nature of the offering – such as the means
through which the issuer publicly solicits purchasers – may be relevant in determining the
reasonableness of the steps taken to verify accredited investor status. An issuer that
solicits new investors through a website accessible to the general public, through a widely
disseminated email or social media solicitation, or through print media, such as a
newspaper, will likely be obligated to take greater measures to verify accredited investor
status than an issuer that solicits new investors from a database of pre-screened
accredited investors created and maintained by a reasonably reliable third party. We
believe that an issuer will be entitled to rely on a third party that has verified a person’s
status as an accredited investor, provided that the issuer has a reasonable basis to rely on
such third-party verification. We do not believe that an issuer will have taken reasonable
steps to verify accredited investor status if it, or those acting on its behalf, required only

113

For example, in the future, services may develop that verify a person’s accredited investor status for
purposes of new Rule 506(c) and permit issuers to check the accredited investor status of possible
investors, particularly for web-based Rule 506 offering portals that include offerings for multiple issuers.
This third-party service, as opposed to the issuer itself, could obtain appropriate documentation or
otherwise take reasonable steps to verify accredited investor status. Several commenters, in fact, have
recommended that the Commission take action to facilitate the ability of issuers to rely on third parties to
perform the necessary verification. See letters from NASAA (July 3, 2012) (recommending that the
Commission allow an issuer to obtain the necessary verification through registered broker-dealers, provided
that there are independent liability provisions for failure to adequately perform the verification);
Massachusetts Securities Division (July 2, 2012) (urging the Commission to adopt as a safe harbor or best
practice the use of an independent party, such as a broker-dealer, bank, or other financial institution, that
would verify the accredited investor status of purchasers). One commenter, however, expressed concerns
that some of the websites that currently offer lists of accredited investors could be used to facilitate fraud,
noting that some offer lists based on “ethnicity, gender, and lifestyle – presumably to make [it] easier for
scammers to relate to marks – and ominously, ‘seniors.’” Letter from I. Moscovitz and J. Maxfield (June
27, 2012).

33

that a person check a box in a questionnaire or sign a form, absent other information
about the purchaser indicating accredited investor status.
The terms of the offering will also affect whether the verification methods used
by the issuer are reasonable. We continue to believe that there is merit to the view that a
purchaser’s ability to meet a high minimum investment amount could be a relevant factor
to the issuer’s evaluation of the types of steps that would be reasonable to take in order to
verify that purchaser’s status as an accredited investor. By way of example, the ability of
a purchaser to satisfy a minimum investment amount requirement that is sufficiently high
such that only accredited investors could reasonably be expected to meet it, with a direct
cash investment that is not financed by the issuer or by any third party, could be taken
into consideration in verifying accredited investor status.
Commenters suggested a number of alternative approaches to implementing the
verification mandate. Some commenters urged us to adopt a requirement that prescribes
specific methods of verification that issuers must use, either because they believed such
methods are needed for issuers seeking clarity on how to comply with this condition of
Rule 506(c) 114 or because they believed that such methods are needed to maintain
investor protection. 115 We have decided not to take such an approach. As we stated in
the Proposing Release, we believe that, at present, requiring issuers to use specified
methods of verification will be impractical and potentially ineffective in light of the
numerous ways in which a purchaser can qualify as an accredited investor, as well as the
potentially wide range of verification issues that may arise, depending on the nature of
114

See, e.g., letter from Handler Thayer, LLP.

115

See, e.g., letters from AARP; CII.

34

the purchaser and the facts and circumstances of a particular Rule 506(c) offering. We
are also concerned that a prescriptive rule that specifies required verification methods
could be overly burdensome in some cases, by requiring issuers to follow the same steps,
regardless of their particular circumstances, and ineffective in others, by requiring steps
that, in the particular circumstances, would not actually verify accredited investor status.
We believe that the approach we are adopting appropriately addresses the
concerns underlying the verification mandate by obligating issuers to take reasonable
steps to verify that the purchasers are accredited investors, but not requiring them to
follow uniform verification methods that may be ill-suited or unnecessary to a particular
offering or purchaser in light of the facts and circumstances. We also expect that such an
approach will give issuers and market participants the flexibility to adopt different
approaches to verification depending on the circumstances, to adapt to changing market
practices, and to implement innovative approaches to meeting the verification
requirement, such as the development of reliable third-party databases of accredited
investors and verification services. In addition, we anticipate that many practices
currently used by issuers in connection with existing Rule 506 offerings will satisfy the
verification requirement for offerings pursuant to Rule 506(c).
b.

Non-Exclusive Methods of Verifying Accredited
Investor Status

In addition to adopting a principles-based method of verification, we are including
in Rule 506(c) four specific non-exclusive methods of verifying accredited investor status
for natural persons that, if used, are deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule
506(c); provided, however, that none of these methods will be deemed to satisfy the
verification requirement if the issuer or its agent has knowledge that the purchaser is not
35

an accredited investor. 116 While the principles-based method of verification is intended
to provide an issuer with the flexibility to address the particular facts and circumstances
surrounding its offering, we appreciate the view of some commenters that the final rule
should include a non-exclusive list of specific verification methods for natural persons
that may be relied upon by those issuers seeking greater certainty that they satisfy the
rule’s verification requirement. 117 Accordingly, we are adding a non-exclusive list of
specific verification methods to supplement our principles-based framework for verifying
accredited investor status. 118 Issuers are not required to use any of the methods discussed
below, and can apply the reasonableness standard directly to the specific facts and
circumstances presented by the offering and the investors. 119
First, in verifying whether a natural person is an accredited investor on the basis
of income, an issuer is deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c) by
reviewing copies of any Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) form that reports income,
including, but not limited to, a Form W-2 (“Wage and Tax Statement”), Form 1099
(report of various types of income), Schedule K-1 of Form 1065 (“Partner’s Share of
Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.”), and a copy of a filed Form 1040 (“U.S. Individual
116
Because an issuer must have a reasonable belief that the purchaser is an accredited investor, the issuer
could not form such reasonable belief if it has knowledge that the purchaser is not an accredited investor.
See Section II.C of this release for a discussion of the reasonable belief standard in the definition of
accredited investor in Rule 501(a).
117

See, e.g., letters from ACA (Sept. 27, 2012 and Dec. 11, 2012); Investor Advisory Committee; MFA
(Sept. 28, 2012).
118

Information and documentation collected for these verification purposes may be subject to federal
and/or state privacy and data security requirements. See, e.g., Regulation S-P [17 CFR 248.1 - 248.30]
(implementing notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution’s ability to disclose nonpublic
personal information about customers); Privacy of Consumer Financial Information (Regulation S-P),
Release No. 34-42974 (June 22, 2000) [65 FR 40334 (June 29, 2000)].
119

We expect that many issuers will conduct Rule 506(c) offerings in reliance on the principles-based
method of verification, in light of its flexibility and efficiency.

36

Income Tax Return”), 120 for the two most recent years, along with obtaining a written
representation from such person that he or she has a reasonable expectation of reaching
the income level necessary to qualify as an accredited investor during the current year. In
the case of a person who qualifies as an accredited investor based on joint income with
that person’s spouse, an issuer would be deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in
Rule 506(c) by reviewing copies of these forms for the two most recent years in regard
to, and obtaining written representations from, both the person and the spouse.
Second, in verifying whether a natural person is an accredited investor on the
basis of net worth, an issuer is deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule
506(c) by reviewing one or more of the following types of documentation, dated within
the prior three months, 121 and by obtaining a written representation from such person that
all liabilities necessary to make a determination of net worth have been disclosed. In the
case of a person who qualifies as an accredited investor based on joint net worth with that
person’s spouse, an issuer would be deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in
Rule 506(c) by reviewing such documentation in regard to, and obtaining representations
from, both the person and the spouse. For assets: bank statements, brokerage statements
and other statements of securities holdings, certificates of deposit, tax assessments and
appraisal reports issued by independent third parties are deemed to be satisfactory; and

120

A person could provide a redacted version of an Internal Revenue Service form so as to disclose only
information about annual income and to avoid disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as a
Social Security number, or other information that would not be relevant to the determination of a person’s
annual income.
121

A person could provide redacted versions of these documents so as to disclose only information about
the amounts of assets and liabilities and to avoid disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as a
Social Security number, or other information that would not be relevant to the determination of a person’s
net worth.

37

for liabilities: a consumer report (also known as a credit report) from at least one of the
nationwide consumer reporting agencies is required. 122 Commenters did not provide
examples of any other type of documentation that would, in our view, adequately
evidence liabilities. 123 We recognize that it will be difficult for an issuer to determine
whether it has a complete picture of a natural person’s liabilities, and therefore, for
purposes of this method, consistent with the suggestions of some commenters, we are
requiring a consumer report and a written representation from such person that all
liabilities necessary to make a determination of net worth have been disclosed.
Third, an issuer is deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c)
by obtaining a written confirmation from a registered broker-dealer, an SEC-registered
investment adviser, a licensed attorney, or a certified public accountant that such person
or entity has taken reasonable steps to verify that the purchaser is an accredited investor
within the prior three months and has determined that such purchaser is an accredited
investor. 124 While third-party confirmation by one of these parties will be deemed to
satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c), depending on the circumstances, an
issuer may be entitled to rely on the verification of accredited investor status by a person
or entity other than one of these parties, provided that any such third party takes
122

We note that the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) [15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.] requires each of the
nationwide consumer reporting agencies to provide a person with a free copy of his or her consumer report,
upon request, once every 12 months. In addition, the FCRA permits third parties to access individual
consumer reports with the written permission of the individual.
123

One commenter suggested that the Commission “require the issuer to obtain a list of liabilities from the
investor, which would include a sworn statement that all material liabilities are disclosed.” Letter from
NASAA. Another commenter noted that liabilities can be cross checked against UCC 1 filings, bankruptcy
information on Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER), and credit reports. See letter from P.
Sigelman (Sept. 28, 2012).
124

For purposes of this method, a licensed attorney must be in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdictions in which the attorney is admitted to practice law, and a certified public accountant must be in
good standing under the laws of the place of the accountant’s residence or principal office.

38

reasonable steps to verify that purchasers are accredited investors and has determined that
such purchasers are accredited investors, and the issuer has a reasonable basis to rely on
such verification.
Fourth, with respect to any natural person who invested in an issuer’s Rule 506(b)
offering as an accredited investor prior to the effective date of Rule 506(c) and remains
an investor of the issuer, for any Rule 506(c) offering conducted by the same issuer, the
issuer is deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c) with respect to any
such person by obtaining a certification by such person at the time of sale that he or she
qualifies as an accredited investor.
We are including the first three methods in our non-exclusive list of methods that
are deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c) because we believe that
there will likely be few instances in which they would not constitute reasonable steps to
verify accredited investor status. With respect to the verification method for the income
test, there are numerous penalties for falsely reporting information in an Internal Revenue
Service form, and these forms are filed with the Internal Revenue Service for purposes
independent of investing in a Rule 506(c) offering. Similarly, we believe that the various
forms of documentation set forth in the verification method for the net worth test
ordinarily are generated for reasons other than to invest in a Rule 506(c) offering (with
the possible exception of appraisal reports) and, in combination with a consumer report
and a written representation from the investor regarding his or her liabilities, constitute
sufficiently reliable evidence that such person’s net worth exceeds $1 million, excluding
the value of the person’s primary residence. With respect to the third-party verification
method, we have included written confirmations from certain third parties in our non-

39

exclusive list of verification methods because these third parties are subject to various
regulatory and/or licensing requirements. Registered broker-dealers 125 and SECregistered investment advisers 126 are regulated by the Commission; and in the United
States, attorneys and certified public accountants are licensed at the state level and are
subject to rules of professional conduct 127 as well as, to the extent they appear or practice
before the Commission in any way, to the Commission’s Rules of Practice. 128

125

Registered broker-dealers are subject to a comprehensive system of oversight by the Commission as
well as FINRA. In particular, registered broker-dealers, among other things, must maintain and preserve
specified books and records, develop effective supervisory policies and controls, and comply with FINRA
rules regarding registration and qualification requirements for their associated persons as well as general
and specific conduct rules. In addition, registered broker-dealers are subject to examinations by both
FINRA and Commission staff.
126

An investment adviser must register with the Commission unless it is prohibited from registering under
Section 203A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 USC 80b-3a] (the “Advisers Act”) or is exempt
from registration under Advisers Act Section 203 [15 USC 80b-3]. Investment advisers that are prohibited
from registering with the Commission instead may be subject to regulation by the states, but the antifraud
provisions of the Advisers Act continue to apply to them. See Advisers Act Sections 203A(b) and 206 [15
USC 80b-3(a), 15 USC 80b-6]. SEC-registered investment advisers are subject to examinations by
Commission staff.
127

Attorneys are subject to state standards for professional competence and ethical conduct, such as those
based on the American Bar Association (“ABA”) Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which have been
adopted by most states in the United States. For example, Rule 4.1 of the ABA Model Rules of
Professional Conduct prohibits an attorney from knowingly making a false statement of material fact or law
to a third person or failing to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid
assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client. Accountants are also subject to state standards for
professional competence and ethical conduct, such as those based on the AICPA Code of Professional
Conduct. See AICPA Code of Professional Conduct ET 201.01, 202.01; see also, e.g., The Uniform
Accountancy Act (5th ed. 2007), available at:
http://www.aicpa.org/Advocacy/State/StateContactInfo/uaa/DownloadableDocuments/UAA_Fifth_Edition
_January_2008.pdf.
The Commission recognizes that there may be particular considerations a certified public accountant would
need to take into account to comply with applicable professional standards for attestation engagements to
provide a report that constitutes a confirmation in the context of this rule.
128

See Rule 102(e) of the Rules of Practice [17 CFR 201.102(e)] (The Commission may censure a person
or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing and practicing before it in any way to any
person who is found by the Commission after notice and opportunity for hearing in the matter: (i) Not to
possess the requisite qualifications to represent others; or (ii) To be lacking in character or integrity or to
have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct; or (iii) To have willfully violated, or willfully
aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations
thereunder.).

40

We are including the fourth method in our non-exclusive list of methods that are
deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c) because we acknowledge
that existing accredited investors who purchased securities in an issuer’s Rule 506(b)
offering prior to the effective date of Rule 506(c) would presumably participate in any
subsequent offering by the same issuer conducted pursuant to Rule 506(c) based on their
pre-existing relationships with the issuer. Accordingly, for these existing investors who
were accredited investors in a Rule 506(b) offering prior to the effective date of Rule
506(c), a self-certification at the time of sale that he or she is an accredited investor will
be deemed to satisfy the verification requirement in Rule 506(c). This provision does not
extend to existing investors in an issuer who were not accredited investors in a Rule
506(b) offering that was conducted prior to the effective date of Rule 506(c).
While we have not adopted the recommendations of commenters who believe that
even more prescriptive verification requirements are needed, we do recognize the general
concern regarding possible misuse of the new Rule 506(c) exemption to sell securities to
those who are not qualified to participate in the offering. We will closely monitor and
study the development of verification practices by issuers, securities intermediaries and
others by undertaking a review of whether such practices are, in fact, resulting in the
exclusion of non-accredited investors from participation in these offerings, and the
impact of compliance with this verification requirement on investor protection and capital
formation.
C.

Reasonable Belief that All Purchasers Are Accredited Investors

In the Proposing Release, we noted that a number of commenters had raised
concerns that the language of Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act could be interpreted as
precluding the use of the “reasonable belief” standard in the definition of “accredited
41

investor” in Rule 501(a) in determining whether a purchaser is an accredited investor,
such that an issuer’s determination as to whether a purchaser is an accredited investor is
subject to an absolute, rather than a “reasonable belief,” standard. 129 In their view,
issuers may be more reluctant to use general solicitation in Rule 506 offerings if their
determinations as to whether a purchaser is an accredited investor are subject to an
absolute standard. Other commenters had interpreted the difference in the statutory
language used in Section 201(a)(1) and Section 201(a)(2) 130 as indicating Congress’
intent that the Commission “raise the ‘reasonable belief’ standard for Rule 506
offerings….” 131
Commenters on the Proposing Release were divided on the Commission’s
interpretation that the reasonable belief standard in Rule 501(a) applies to offerings under
Rule 506(c). Several commenters supported this interpretation; 132 and other commenters
opposed this interpretation. 133
129

See, e.g., letters from ABA Fed. Reg. Comm. (Apr. 30, 2012); BlackRock (May 3, 2012); NYCBA
(May 4, 2012); W. Sjostrom, Jr. (Apr. 14, 2012).
130

Section 201(a)(2) of the JOBS Act, which calls for amendments to Rule 144A, specifically refers to a
“reasonable belief” standard as to whether a purchaser is a QIB, whereas Section 201(a)(1) does not
mention a similar “reasonable belief” standard with respect to the amendments to Rule 506.

28, 2012) (stating that “[e]liminating the ‘reasonable belief’ standard in the definition of accredited investor
would preclude issuers from relying on Rule 506(c)” and that, if this were the case, “[i]ssuers would not
engage in general solicitation and Section 201 would fail in its intended purposes to modernize the
securities laws”); NSBA; NYCBA; P. Rutledge.

steps’ requirement in the statute by stating that issuers may engage in a general solicitation or advertising
so long as they ‘reasonably believe’ that the investors to be addressed will be accredited”); Consumer

We are reaffirming the view that we expressed on this issue in the Proposing
Release. In our view, the difference in the language between Section 201(a)(1) and
Section 201(a)(2) reflects only the differing manner in which the reasonable belief
standard was included in the respective rules at the time they were adopted, and does not
represent a Congressional intent to eliminate the existing reasonable belief standard in
Rule 501(a) or for Rule 506 offerings. 134 We note that the definition of accredited
investor remains unchanged with the enactment of the JOBS Act and includes persons
that come within any of the listed categories of accredited investors, as well as persons
that the issuer reasonably believes come within any such category.
Further, as discussed in the Proposing Release, we continue to recognize that a
person could provide false information or documentation to an issuer in order to purchase
securities in an offering made under new Rule 506(c). Thus, even if an issuer has taken
reasonable steps to verify that a purchaser is an accredited investor, it is possible that a
person nevertheless could circumvent those measures. 135 If a person who does not meet

Federation (stating that a reasonable belief standard “is in direct conflict with the statutory mandate that all
investors in offerings sold through general solicitation and advertising be accredited investors and that the
Commission specify methods issuers must follow to ensure that this is the case”); Fund Democracy
(arguing that “Congress intentionally chose not to make such [a reasonable belief] exception to the mandate
that Rule 506 purchasers be accredited investors”).
134

Both Rule 506 and Rule 144A currently provide for a reasonable belief standard regarding the
eligibility of an investor to participate in an offering under the respective rules, but they reach that result in
different ways. For Rule 506, the Commission chose to include the reasonable belief standard within the
Rule 501(a) definition of “accredited investor”; for Rule 144A, the Commission chose to include the
standard as a condition, in paragraph (d)(1), to the use of the exemption.
135

We note that several federal courts have been unsympathetic to attempts by investors who represented
that they were accredited investors at the time of the sale of securities to subsequently disavow those
representations in order to pursue a cause of action under the federal securities laws. See, e.g., Wright v.
Nat’l Warranty Co., 953 F.2d 256 (6th Cir. 1991) (rejecting the plaintiffs’ argument that Rule 505 was
unavailable because the plaintiffs “specifically warranted and represented in the subscription agreement …
that they were accredited investors”); Goodwin Properties, LLC v. Acadia Group, Inc., No. 01-49-P-C,
2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9975 (D. Me. 2001) (noting that the plaintiffs “provided the defendants with reason
to believe that they were accredited investors as defined by 17 C.F.R. § 230.501(a)” and stating that

43

the criteria for any category of accredited investor purchases securities in a Rule 506(c)
offering, we believe that the issuer will not lose the ability to rely on Rule 506(c) for that
offering, so long as the issuer took reasonable steps to verify that the purchaser was an
accredited investor and had a reasonable belief that such purchaser was an accredited
investor at the time of sale. 136

Form D Check Box for Rule 506(c) Offerings

Form D is the notice of an offering of securities conducted without registration
under the Securities Act in reliance on Regulation D. 137 Under Rule 503 of Regulation
D, an issuer offering or selling securities in reliance on Rule 504, 505 or 506 must file a
notice of sales on Form D with the Commission for each new offering of securities no
later than 15 calendar days after the first sale of securities in the offering. Form D is
currently organized around 16 numbered “items” or categories of information. The
information required to be provided in a Form D filing includes basic identifying
information, such as the name of the issuer of the securities and the issuer’s year and
place of incorporation or organization; information about related persons (executive
therefore “[t]hey cannot now disavow those representations in order to support their claims against the
defendants”); Faye L. Roth Revocable Trust v. UBS Painewebber Inc., 323 F. Supp. 2d 1279 (S.D. Fla.
2004) (stating that the plaintiffs “cannot disavow their representations that they were accredited investors”
and concluding that there was no material dispute that the offering complied with Regulation D).
136
Our views regarding an issuer’s ability to maintain the exemption for a Rule 506(c) offering
notwithstanding the fact that not all purchasers meet the criteria for any category of accredited investor are
consistent with our views regarding the effect of attempts by prospective investors to circumvent the
requirement in Regulation S that offers and sales be made only to non-U.S. persons. See Statement of the
Commission Regarding Use of Internet Web Sites to Offer Securities, Solicit Securities Transactions or
Advertise Investment Services Offshore, Release No. 33-7516 (Mar. 23, 1998) [63 FR 14806 (Mar. 27,
1998)] (“In our view, if a U.S. person purchases securities or investment services notwithstanding adequate
procedures reasonably designed to prevent the purchase, we would not view the Internet offer after the fact
as having been targeted at the United States, absent indications that would put the issuer on notice that the
purchaser was a U.S. person.”).
137

Form D also applies to offerings conducted using the Section 4(a)(5) exemption. The Commission
adopted Form D when it adopted Regulation D in 1982. Release No. 33-6389 (adopting Form D as a
replacement for Forms 4(6), 146, 240 and 242).

officers, directors, and promoters); the exemption or exemptions being claimed for the
offering; and factual information about the offering, such as the duration of the offering,
the type of securities offered and the total offering amount.
1.

Proposed Form Amendment

We proposed revising Form D to add a separate field or check box for issuers to
indicate whether they are claiming an exemption under Rule 506(c). Item 6 of Form D
currently requires the issuer to identify the claimed exemption or exemptions for the
offering from among Rule 504’s paragraphs and subparagraphs, Rule 505, Rule 506 and
former Section 4(5), as applicable. Under the proposal, a new check box in Item 6 of
Form D would require issuers to indicate specifically whether they are relying on the
Rule 506(c) exemption. In addition, the current check box for “Rule 506” would be
renamed “Rule 506(b),” and the current check box for “Section 4(5)” would be renamed
“Section 4(a)(5)” to update the reference to former Section 4(5) of the Securities Act.
We explained in the Proposing Release that this revision would provide additional
information needed to assist our efforts to analyze the use of general solicitation in Rule
506(c) offerings and the size of this offering market. The information would also help us
to look into the practices that may develop to satisfy the verification requirement, which
would assist us in assessing the effectiveness of various verification practices in
identifying and excluding non-accredited investors from participation in Rule 506(c)
offerings.

Comments on the Proposed Form Amendment

Most commenters who expressed a view on the proposed checkbox in Form D
supported the addition of this checkbox for issuers to indicate whether they are relying on

45

Rule 506(c) for their offerings. 138 Only one commenter opposed the proposed
checkbox. 139 A number of commenters recommended that the Commission include
additional information requirements in Form D for Rule 506(c) offerings, beyond a
checkbox to indicate reliance on Rule 506(c). 140 Some commenters asked for
confirmation that issuers may check both the Rule 506(b) box and the Rule 506(c) box in
a Form D under certain circumstances. 141
3.

Final Form Amendment

We are adopting the revision to Form D as proposed. Issuers conducting Rule
506(c) offerings must indicate that they are relying on the Rule 506(c) exemption by
marking the new check box in Item 6 of Form D. Further, as proposed, the current check
box for “Rule 506” will be renamed “Rule 506(b),” and the current check box for
“Section 4(5)” will be renamed “Section 4(a)(5).”
We are of the view that an issuer will not be permitted to check both boxes at the
same time for the same offering. We remind issuers that once a general solicitation has
been made to the purchasers in the offering, 142 an issuer is precluded from making a
claim of reliance on Rule 506(b), which remains subject to the prohibition against general

That is, the purchasers became interested in the offering because of, or through, the general solicitation,
and not through some means other than the general solicitation, such as through a substantive, pre-existing
relationship with the company or direct contact by the company or its agents outside of the general
solicitation. See Revisions of Limited Offering Exemptions in Regulation D, Release No. 33-8828 (Aug. 3,

Specific Issues for Private Funds

Private funds, such as hedge funds, venture capital funds and private equity funds,
typically rely on Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506 to offer and sell their interests without
registration under the Securities Act. 143 In addition, private funds generally rely on one of
two exclusions from the definition of “investment company” under the Investment
Company Act – Section 3(c)(1) 144 and Section 3(c)(7) 145 – which enables them to be
excluded from substantially all of the regulatory provisions of that Act. 146 Private funds
are precluded from relying on either of these two exclusions if they make a public
offering of their securities. 147 Section 3(c)(1) excludes from the definition of “investment
company” any issuer whose outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) are
beneficially owned by not more than 100 beneficial owners, 148 and which is not making
and does not presently propose to make a public offering of its securities. Section 3(c)(7)
excludes from the definition of “investment company” any issuer whose outstanding
securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such

15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(7).

146

We also refer in this release to “pooled investment funds” because that term is used in Form D. Issuers
that rely on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act are a subset of pooled investment
funds.
147

See also Section 202(a)(29) of the Advisers Act [15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(29)] (defining a “private fund” as
an issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, but for Sections
3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act). Many ABS issuers also rely on the exclusions contained in Sections 3(c)(1)
or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. These ABS issuers frequently participate in Rule 144A
offerings.
148

See also Rule 3c-5 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.3c-5] (providing that the section’s
limit of 100 beneficial owners does not include “knowledgeable employees,” as defined in the rule).

securities, are “qualified purchasers,” 149 and which is not making and does not at that time
propose to make a public offering of its securities.
Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act directs the Commission to eliminate the
prohibition against general solicitation for a new category of Rule 506 offerings, and
makes no specific reference to private funds. Section 201(b) of the JOBS Act also
provides that “[o]ffers and sales exempt under [Rule 506, as revised pursuant to Section
201(a)] shall not be deemed public offerings under the Federal securities laws as a result
of general advertising or general solicitation.” We historically have regarded Rule 506
transactions as non-public offerings for purposes of Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7). 150 As
we stated in the Proposing Release and reaffirm here, the effect of Section 201(b) is to
permit private funds to engage in general solicitation in compliance with new Rule 506(c)
without losing either of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act.
A few commenters argued that Section 201(b) does not permit private funds to
engage in general solicitation under proposed Rule 506(c) without losing their exclusions
under the Investment Company Act. 151 In our view, although Section 201(b) does not
explicitly reference the meaning of “public offering” under the Investment Company Act,
it clearly states that “[o]ffers and sales exempt under [Rule 506, as revised pursuant to
149

See Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(51)] and the rules thereunder.
See also Rule 3c-5 under the Investment Company Act (excluding “knowledgeable employees” from the
determination of whether all of the outstanding securities of the fund relying on Section 3(c)(7) are owned
exclusively by qualified purchasers).
150

See Release No. 33-6389 (noting that the “Commission regards rule 506 transactions as non-public
offerings for purposes of the definition of ‘investment company’ in section 3(c)(1) of the Investment
Company Act”); Privately Offered Investment Companies, Release No. IC-22597 (Apr. 3, 1997) [62 FR
17512 (Apr. 9, 1997)], at n. 5 (noting that the “Commission believes that section 3(c)(7)’s public offering
limitation should be interpreted in the same manner as the limitation in section 3(c)(1)”).
151

See letter from Fund Democracy (stating that “Section 201(b) refers only to Rule 506; it makes no
reference to the meaning of ‘public offering’ under the Investment Company Act exemptions”). See also
letter from AFL-CIO and AFR.

Section 201(a)] shall not be deemed public offerings under the Federal securities laws as
a result of general advertising or general solicitation” (emphasis added). As the
Investment Company Act is a federal securities law, the effect of Section 201(b) is to
permit offers and sales of securities under Rule 506(c) by private funds relying on the
exclusions from the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(c)(1) or Section
3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
Some commenters expressed concerns about private funds engaging in general
solicitation under proposed Rule 506(c). 152 Other commenters, however, supported the
removal of the prohibition against general solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings with
respect to private funds, 153 with some commenters stating that the removal of the ban
would bring greater transparency to the private fund industry and allow managers of
private funds to communicate more effectively with the public and prospective
investors. 154
Some commenters who were concerned about private funds engaging in general
solicitation recommended that we impose additional conditions on private funds that rely
on Rule 506(c). In particular, a number of commenters believed that private funds
engaging in general solicitation should be subject to some form of content and/or other
restrictions, and suggested potential methods. 155 For example, some believed that, in

commenters suggested that the Commission develop rules tailored to the ways private
funds calculate and present investment performance, rather than extending mutual fund
performance rules to private funds. 157 Some made other suggestions, such as requiring
each private fund relying on Rule 506(c) to disclose that the private fund is not registered
with the Commission and should not be confused with a registered fund, such as a mutual
fund. 158 With respect to private funds sold through broker-dealers subject to FINRA’s
rules of conduct, some commenters believed that we should direct FINRA to require the

See, e.g., letters from C. Corn; Sen. Levin (noting that “[a]lready, the Commission has determined that
the manner and substance of solicitation and advertising for investments in registered investment
companies deserves significant regulatory oversight. Many of those same concerns apply to investments in
private investment vehicles. Accordingly, the Commission should impose analogous protections for
investments in private funds.”); Consumer Federation (stating that “[s]hort of an outright prohibition on
general solicitation and advertising by private funds, the Commission should at the very least adopt clear
standards for the reporting of performance and fees by private funds, and delay their eligibility from
engaging in general solicitation and advertising until such time as those standards are in place,” including a
requirement to include in private fund advertisements “a clear, prominent warning that they are not mutual
funds and carry special risks.”); D. Kronheim; D. Smith; Fund Democracy (noting that an alternative would
be to “apply mutual fund advertising and valuation rules to hedge funds that engage in [general solicitation
and advertising] (and, in any case, require standardized performance and fee reporting for all hedge funds),
and require explicit, large-font disclaimers that hedge funds are not mutual funds and present special
risks.”); G. Lavy; ICI (recommending content restrictions on private fund advertising at least as extensive
as those currently applicable to mutual funds (e.g., disclaimers regarding the performance figures or
measures displayed in any advertisement), with a prohibition on use of performance advertising until the
Commission can develop a new rule regarding such advertising); IDC; NASAA (stating that “because the
investment strategies of private funds are typically more opaque, risky, and illiquid than those of mutual
funds, private fund advertisements should be subject to restrictions that are comparable to the rules for
mutual funds.”); P. Turney.

See letter from ICI (arguing that the antifraud provisions in Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act [15
U.S.C. 80b-6(4)] and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder [17 CFR 275.206(4)-8] would not be enough to protect
investors because these advertisements will be presented before accredited and non-accredited investors at
the same time).

filing and review of private fund advertisements. 159
Finally, some commenters opposed the imposition of content and/or other
restrictions for private funds. 160 They asserted that purchasers of the securities of a
private fund that relies on Rule 506(c), must be, at a minimum, accredited investors and
thus have met objective criteria demonstrating financial sophistication, which they
believed eliminates the risk that other types of investors could be defrauded. 161 A number
of commenters pointed out that advertisements of private funds are subject to the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and suggested that liability under such
provisions provides sufficient investor protections. 162
We have carefully considered commenters’ suggestions and concerns. We are
mindful of certain commenters’ concerns that private funds engaging in general
solicitation may raise certain investor protection issues. We also understand that other
commenters believe that additional measures regarding private fund advertising are not
necessary because the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws continue to
apply. We will monitor and study the development of private fund advertising and

See letters from AFL-CIO and AFR (stating that “FINRA already pre-reviews broker-dealer
advertising; the same requirement should apply to general solicitation and advertising in Rule 506 offerings
in light of the significant potential for abuse.”); ICI (noting that “FINRA has developed an infrastructure to
handle such filings and an expertise to substantively review them, and accordingly is best positioned to
handle this task.”).
160

See, e.g., letters from Verrill Dana LLP (stating that “[t]here is no suggestion in Section 201 that the
Commission must distinguish between ‘issuers that engage in operational businesses’ and ‘those that are
merely investment vehicles’”); Artivest (noting that for private funds managed by a registered commodity
pool operator, the National Futures Association Rule 2-29 contains standards regarding marketing
materials).
161

In general, private funds that pay performance fees to their managers are available only to “qualified
clients” that have at least $1 million in assets under management or that have a net worth of $2 million
(excluding the value of the client’s primary residence). See Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act [17 CFR
275.205-3]. See also letter from BlackRock.

undertake a review to determine whether any further action is necessary.
We remind investment advisers to private funds that they are subject to Rule
206(4)-8 under the Advisers Act. 163 Rule 206(4)-8 provides that it shall constitute a
fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative act, practice or course of business within the
meaning of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act for any investment adviser to a pooled
investment vehicle 164 to “(1) [m]ake any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, to any investor or prospective investor in
the pooled investment vehicle; or (2) otherwise engage in any act, practice or course of
business that is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative with respect to any investor or
prospective investor in the pooled investment vehicle.” 165
As was stated by the Commission when it adopted Rule 206-4(8), “[t]he rule
clarifies that an adviser’s duty to refrain from fraudulent conduct under the federal
securities laws extends to the relationship with ultimate investors and that the
Commission may bring enforcement actions under the Advisers Act against investment
advisers who defraud investors or prospective investors in those pooled investment
vehicles.” 166 We further stated that we “intend to employ all of the broad authority that
Congress provided us in section 206(4) and direct it at adviser conduct affecting an
163

17 CFR 275.206(4)-8.

164

Rule 206(4)-8 defines a pooled investment vehicle to mean any investment company as defined in
Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)] or any company that would be an
investment company under Section 3(a) of that Act but for the exclusion provided from that definition by
either Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of that Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1) or (7)].

investor or potential investor in a pooled investment vehicle.” 167 Recently, for example,
we have brought enforcement actions against private fund advisers and others for
material misrepresentations to investors and prospective investors regarding fund
performance, strategy, and investments, among other things. 168
We believe that investment advisers that have implemented appropriate policies
and procedures regarding, among other things, the nature and content of private fund
sales literature, including general solicitation materials, are less likely to use materials
that materially mislead investors or otherwise violate the federal securities laws.
Accordingly, we believe that investment advisers to private funds should carefully review
any such policies and procedures that have been implemented to determine whether they
are reasonably designed to prevent the use of fraudulent or materially misleading private
fund advertising and make appropriate amendments to those policies and procedures,
particularly if the private funds intend to engage in general solicitation activity. 169

Technical and Conforming Amendments

We proposed a number of technical and conforming amendments to Rules 502
and 506 of Regulation D. Under the proposal, we would amend various provisions in

See, e.g., In the Matter of Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc. and Oppenheimer Alternative

Capital Management LLC, et al., Release No. IA-3399 (Apr. 20, 2012).
169

We remind investment advisers that are registered or required to be registered under Section 203 of the
Advisers Act that they must adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
prevent violations of the Advisers Act which include, but are not limited to, violations of Section 206 of the
Advisers Act and the rules thereunder. They must also review, no less frequently than annually, the
adequacy of the written policies and procedures and the effectiveness of the policies and procedures’
implementation. See CFR 275.206(4)-7.

Rule 502(b) to clarify that the references to sales to non-accredited investors under Rule
506, and the corresponding informational requirements, would be applicable to offerings
under Rule 506(b) and not to offerings under Rule 506(c). We proposed to amend Rule
502(c) to clarify that Rule 502(c)’s prohibition against general solicitation would not
apply to offerings under Rule 506(c). In addition, as Section 201(c) of the JOBS Act
renumbered Section 4 of the Securities Act, we proposed to amend Regulation D and
Rule 144A to update the references to Section 4. Finally, the proposal would update
references to Section 2 of the Securities Act in these rules as some of the references have
not been updated to reflect the current numbering scheme in Section 2. We received no
comments regarding these technical and conforming amendments and are adopting these
rule amendments as proposed.
III.

FINAL AMENDMENT TO RULE 144A
Section 201(a)(2) of the JOBS Act directs the Commission to revise Rule

144A(d)(1) under the Securities Act to provide that securities sold pursuant to Rule 144A
may be offered to persons other than QIBs, including by means of general solicitation,
provided that securities are sold only to persons that the seller and any person acting on
behalf of the seller reasonably believe is a QIB. To implement the mandated rule change,
we proposed amending Rule 144A(d)(1) to eliminate the references to “offer” and
“offeree.” All of the commenters that expressed a view on the proposed amendment to
Rule 144A(d)(1) stated that they supported the Commission’s proposal. 170 We are
adopting the amendment as proposed. As amended, Rule 144A(d)(1) will require only
that the securities be sold to a QIB or to a purchaser that the seller and any person acting
170

See letters from IAA; SIFMA and FSR (Oct. 5, 2012); J. Johnson; OTC Markets Group Inc.

54

on behalf of the seller reasonably believe is a QIB. 171 Under this amendment, resales of
securities pursuant to Rule 144A can be conducted using general solicitation, so long as
the purchasers are limited in this manner. 172
As a result of the Section 201(a)(2) mandate and the resulting Rule 144A
revisions, we are also making technical and conforming revisions to the exceptions in
Regulation M relating to transactions in Rule 144A securities, specifically Regulation M
Rules 101(b)(10), 102(b)(7) and 104(j)(2). When adopted in 1996, the exceptions
delineated in Rules 101(b)(10)(i), 102(b)(7)(i) and 104(j)(2)(i) were generally intended to
permit transactions in securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A during a distribution
of securities, provided that offers and sales of such securities were made solely to QIBs
or persons reasonably believed to be QIBs in certain transactions exempt from
registration. 173
As explained above, Section 201(a)(2) of the JOBS Act directs the Commission
to revise Rule 144A to permit offers of securities to persons other than QIBs. As noted
above, Rule 144A is being amended to eliminate references to “offer” and “offeree,” so
that the amended rule will require only that securities be sold to a QIB or to a purchaser
that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believes is a QIB.

The general solicitation that is permitted in Rule 144A resales from the initial purchaser to the QIBs
will not affect the availability of the Section 4(a)(2) exemption or Regulation S for the initial sale of
securities by the issuer to the initial purchaser.
173

See Anti-Manipulation Rules Concerning Securities Offerings, Release No. 34-38067 (Dec. 20, 1996)
[62 FR 520 (Jan. 3, 1997)] at 530 (“As adopted, the exception permits transactions in Rule 144A securities
during a distribution of such securities, provided that sales of such securities within the United States are
made solely to: qualified institution buyers (‘QIBs’), or persons reasonably believed to be QIBs, in
transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act…. The exception covers both the Rule 144A
security being distributed and any reference security.”).

55

In order to conform the language in Regulation M to Rule 144A, as amended, we
are conforming the Regulation M exceptions by similarly eliminating the references to
“offered” and “offerees.” We believe that these conforming modifications do not result
in any substantive change to the Regulation M exceptions and are consistent with the
purpose of the exceptions.
As a transition matter, for an ongoing Rule 144A offering that commenced before
the effective date of the amendment to Rule 144A(d)(1), offering participants will be
entitled to conduct the portion of the offering following the effective date of the
amendment to Rule 144A(d)(1) using general solicitation, without affecting the
availability of Rule 144A for the portion of the offering that occurred prior to the
effective date of the amended rule.
IV.

INTEGRATION WITH OFFSHORE OFFERINGS
In the Proposing Release, we noted that the mandate in Section 201(a) that the

Commission amend Rule 506 and Rule 144A to permit the use of general solicitation in
transactions under those rules has raised questions from some commenters 174 regarding
the impact of the use of general solicitation on the availability of the Regulation S safe
harbors for concurrent unregistered offerings inside and outside the United States. 175
The safe harbors are important when U.S. and non-U.S. companies engage in global
174

See, e.g., letters from ABA Fed. Reg. Comm. (Apr. 30, 2012); L. Neumann (June 12, 2012); NYCBA
(May 4, 2012); SecuritiesLawUSA, PC (June 26, 2012); SIFMA (Apr. 27, 2012).
175

Regulation S provides a safe harbor for offers and sales of securities outside the United States and
includes an issuer and a resale safe harbor. Two general conditions apply to both safe harbors: (1) the
securities must be sold in an offshore transaction and (2) there can be no “directed selling efforts” in the
United States. Rule 902(c)(1) [17 CFR 230.902(c)(1)] broadly defines “directed selling efforts” as: any
activity undertaken for the purpose of, or that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of,
conditioning the market in the United States for any of the securities offered in reliance on Regulation S.
Such activity includes placing an advertisement in a publication “with a general circulation in the United
States” that refers to the offering of securities being made in reliance upon Regulation S.

56

offerings of securities in which the U.S. portion of the offering is conducted in
accordance with Rule 144A or Rule 506 and the offshore portion is conducted in reliance
on Regulation S.
We expressed our view on this issue in the Proposing Release, which we are
reaffirming in this release. 176 Concurrent offshore offerings that are conducted in
compliance with Regulation S will not be integrated with domestic unregistered offerings
that are conducted in compliance with Rule 506 or Rule 144A, as amended. As
explained in the Proposing Release, we believe that our view is consistent with the
historical treatment of concurrent Regulation S and Rule 144A/Rule 506 offerings. 177

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A.

Background

The amendment to Form D contains a “collection of information” requirement
within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 178 We published
a notice requesting comment on the collection of information requirement in the
Proposing Release for the rule and form amendments. We submitted that requirement to
176

All of the commenters who expressed a view on our interpretation supported it and encouraged us to
reiterate it in this release. See letters from ABA Fed. Reg. Comm; Forum for U.S. Securities Lawyers in
London; IAA; IPA; NYCBA.
177

See Offshore Offers and Sales, Release No. 33-6863 (Apr. 24, 1990) [55 FR 18306 (May 2, 1990)]
(stating that “[o]ffshore transactions made in compliance with Regulation S will not be integrated with
registered domestic offerings or domestic offerings that satisfy the requirements for an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act.”). In addressing the offshore transaction component of the Regulation
S safe harbor, the Commission also stated, “Offers made in the United States in connection with
contemporaneous registered offerings or offerings exempt from registration will not preclude reliance on
the safe harbors.” Id. at n. 36. Likewise, in addressing directed selling efforts, the Commission stated,
“Offering activities in contemporaneous registered offerings or offerings exempt from registration will not
preclude reliance on the safe harbors.” Id. at n. 47. See also Rule 500(g) of Regulation D [17 CFR
230.500(g)] (formerly Preliminary Note No. 7 to Regulation D) (“Regulation S may be relied upon for such
offers and sales even if coincident offers and sales are made in accordance with Regulation D inside the
United States.”).
178

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

57

the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review and approval in accordance
with the PRA and its implementing regulations. 179 The title of this requirement is:
“Form D” (OMB Control No. 3235-0076). 180
We adopted Regulation D and Form D as part of the establishment of a series of
exemptions for offerings and sales of securities under the Securities Act. The Form D
filing is required to be made by issuers as a notice of sales without registration under the
Securities Act based on a claim of exemption under Regulation D or Section 4(a)(5) of
the Securities Act. The Form D filing is required to include basic information about the
issuer, certain related persons, and the offering. This information is needed for
implementing the exemptions and analyzing their use. The information collection
requirements related to the filing of Form D with the Commission are mandatory to the
extent that an issuer elects to make an offering of securities in reliance on the relevant
exemption. Responses are not confidential. The hours and costs associated with
preparing and filing forms and retaining records constitute reporting and cost burdens
imposed by the collection of information requirements. An agency may not conduct or
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information
requirement unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
As discussed above, we proposed to amend Form D to add a check box to indicate
an offering relying on the Rule 506(c) exemption. In the Proposing Release, we
requested comment on our PRA burden hour and cost estimates and the analysis used to
derive such estimates. One commenter responded to our request for comment on the
179

44 U.S.C. 3507(d); 5 CFR 1320.11.

180

Form D was adopted under the authority of Sections 2(a)(15), 3(b), 4(a)(2), 19(a) and 19(c)(3) of the
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15), 77c(b), 77d(a)(2), 77s(a) and 77s(c)(3)].

58

PRA analysis and stated that it believed that the cost estimates in the PRA and economic
analysis are too low. 181
B.

Revisions to PRA Reporting and Cost Burden Estimates

Consistent with the PRA analysis in the Proposing Release, we believe that the
addition of a check box on Form D to indicate that an issuer is relying on the Rule 506(c)
exemption for its offering will have a negligible effect on the paperwork burden of the
form. Form D already contains a check box for each basis of exemption claimed under
Regulation D; this change simply conforms the form to the new rule amendment.
Accordingly, we estimate that under the amendment to Form D, the burden for
responding to the collection of information in Form D will be substantially the same as
before the amendment to Form D. We believe, however, that the amendment to Rule 506
could increase the number of Form D filings that are made with the Commission because
we expect issuers may conduct more Rule 506 offerings.
The table below shows the current total annual compliance burden, in hours and
in costs, of the collection of information pursuant to Form D. For purposes of the PRA,
we estimate that, over a three-year period, the average burden estimate will be four hours
per Form D filing. Our burden estimate represents the average burden for all issuers.
This burden is reflected as a one hour burden of preparation on the issuer and a cost of
$1,200 per filing. In deriving these estimates, we assume that 25% of the burden of
preparation is carried by the issuer internally and that 75% of the burden of preparation is
181

See letter from NSBA (stating that “the compliance cost estimates should include the time required by
the issuer and their advisors to familiarize themselves with the rule and to comply with the additional
verification requirements and the time and costs of investors to comply (for example, with a third-party
verification requirement)”). For PRA purposes, we consider only the burden of responding to the
collection of information in Form D; we do not consider any of the other costs, direct or indirect, of
conducting a Rule 506(c) offering.

59

carried by outside professionals retained by the issuer at an average cost of $400 per
hour. The portion of the burden carried by outside professionals is reflected as a cost,
while the portion of the burden carried by the issuer internally is reflected in hours.

According to our Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (“DERA”), in 2012,
16,067 companies made 18,187 new Form D filings. The annual number of new Form D
filings rose from 13,764 in 2009 to 18,187 in 2012, an average increase of approximately
1,474 Form D filings per year, or approximately 10%. Assuming that the
macroeconomic factors underlying this increase persist and the number of Form D filings
continues to increase by 1,474 filings per year for each of the next three years, the
average number of Form D filings in each of the next three years, absent the elimination
of the prohibition against general solicitation, would be approximately 21,135.
We anticipate that new paragraph (c) of Rule 506 could result in an even greater
annual increase in the number of Form D filings than the 10% annual increase estimated
above. As a reference point for the potential increase, we use the impact of another past
rule change on the market for Regulation D offerings. In 1997, the Commission amended

182

We had previously estimated the number of responses to be 25,000, as reflected in OMB’s Inventory of
Currently Approved Information Collections (available at:
http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain;jsessionid=D37174B5F6F9148DB767D63DF6983A65), but
we are revising this estimate to reflect the number of new Form D filings made in 2012.

60

Rule 144(d) under the Securities Act 183 to reduce the holding period for restricted
securities from two years to one year, 184 thereby increasing the attractiveness of
Regulation D offerings to investors and to issuers. There were 10,341 Form D filings in
1996. This was followed by a 20% increase in the number of Form D filings in each of
the subsequent three calendar years, reaching 17,830 by 1999. Although it is not possible
to predict with any degree of accuracy the increase in the number of Rule 506 offerings
following the elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation for a new
category of Rule 506 offerings, we assume for purposes of this analysis that there could
be a similarly significant increase.
For purposes of the PRA and based on our analysis above, we estimate that the
amendment to Rule 506 will result in a 20% increase in Form D filings relying on the
Rule 506 exemption, or approximately 3,637 filings. 185 We also assume that the number
of Form D filings will increase by approximately 3,637 in each year following the
adoption of the rule.
Based on this increase, we estimate that the annual compliance burden of the
collection of information requirements for the first year in which issuers will make Form
D filings after the adoption of Rule 506(c) will be an aggregate of 21,824 hours of issuer
personnel time and $26,188,800 for the services of outside professionals per year.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Background

We are adopting amendments to Rule 506 and Rule 144A to implement the
requirements of Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act. 187 Section 201(a)(1) directs the
Commission to revise Rule 506 to provide that the prohibition against general solicitation
contained in Rule 502(c) shall not apply to offers and sales of securities made pursuant to
Rule 506, as amended, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited
investors. Section 201(a)(1) also provides that “such rules shall require the issuer to take
reasonable steps to verify that purchasers of the securities are accredited investors, using
such methods as determined by the Commission.” Section 201(a)(2) of the JOBS Act
directs the Commission to revise Rule 144A(d)(1) to provide that securities sold pursuant
to Rule 144A may be offered to persons other than QIBs, including by means of general
solicitation, provided that securities are sold only to persons that the seller and any person
acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe are QIBs.
We are mindful of the costs imposed by and the benefits obtained from our rules.
186

The information in this column is based on the 18,187 new Form D filings that were made in 2012, plus
the additional 3,637 filings we estimate would be filed in the first year after the effectiveness of Rule
506(c).
187

As explained above, the Commission in this release is adopting only those rule and form amendments
that are specifically mandated by Section 201(a). Correspondingly, we analyze the economic impacts –
including the benefits and costs – only of those rules and form amendments considered within the scope of
this release.

62

The discussion below addresses the economic effects of the amendments to Rule 506,
Rule 144A and Form D, including the likely benefits and costs of the amendments as well
as the effect of the amendments on efficiency, competition and capital formation. 188
Some of the costs and benefits stem from the statutory mandate of Section 201(a),
whereas others are affected by the discretion we have exercised in implementing this
mandate. These two types of costs and benefits may not be entirely separable to the
extent that our discretion is exercised to realize the benefits that we believe were intended
by Section 201(a).
B.

Economic Baseline

The baseline analysis that follows is in large part based on information collected
from Form D filings submitted by issuers relying on Regulation D to raise capital. As we
describe in more detail below, we believe that we do not have a complete view of the
Rule 506 market, particularly with respect to the amount of capital raised. Currently,
issuers are required to file a Form D within 15 days of the first sale of securities, and are
required to report additional sales through amended filings only under certain conditions.
In addition, issuers may not report all required information, either due to error or because
they do not wish to make the information public. Commenters have suggested and we
also have evidence that some issuers do not file a Form D for their offerings in

188

Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] requires the Commission, when engaging in
rulemaking that requires it to consider whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest,
to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action would promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation.

63

compliance with Rule 503. 189 Consequently, the analysis that follows is necessarily
subject to these limitations in the current Form D reporting process.
1.

Size of the Exempt Offering Market

Exempt offerings play a significant role in capital formation in the United States.
Offerings conducted in reliance on Rule 506 account for 99% of the capital reported as
being raised under Regulation D from 2009 to 2012, and represent approximately 94% of
the number of Regulation D offerings. 190 The significance of Rule 506 offerings is
underscored by the comparison to registered offerings. In 2012, the estimated amount of
capital reported as being raised in Rule 506 offerings (including both equity and debt)
was $898 billion, compared to $1.2 trillion raised in registered offerings. 191 Of this $898
billion, operating companies (issuers that are not pooled investment funds) reported
raising $173 billion, while pooled investment funds reported raising $725 billion. 192 The
amount reported as being raised by pooled investment funds is comparable to the amount
of capital raised by registered investment funds. In 2012, registered investment funds

189

Many commenters asserted that non-compliance with Form D filing obligations is widespread. See,
e.g., letters from Investor Advisory Committee (stating that “[i]t is generally acknowledged that a
significant number of issuers do not currently file Form D...”); AARP (stating that “[s]imply adding a
checkbox to a form that too often goes unfiled and then only after the fact is inadequate to the task at
hand.”); AFL-CIO and AFR (stating that “many issuers today flout the Form D filing requirement for such
offerings, further limiting the Commission’s ability to provide effective oversight”). See also Securities
and Exchange Commission, Office of Inspector General, Regulation D Exemption Process (Mar. 31, 2009)
(“OIG Report”), available at: http://www.sec-oig.gov/Reports/AuditsInspections/2009/459.pdf (stating
that while the Commission staff “strongly encourage companies to comply with Rule 503, they are aware
of instances in which issuers have failed to comply with Rule 503…”). Based on its analysis of the filings
required by FINRA Rules 5122 and 5123 during the period of December 3, 2012 to February 5, 2013,
DERA estimates that as many as 9% of the offerings represented in the FINRA filings for Regulation D or
other private offerings that used a registered broker did not have a corresponding Form D.

(which include money market mutual funds, long-term mutual funds, exchange-traded
funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts) raised approximately $727 billion. 193
In 2011, the estimated amount of capital (including both equity and debt) reported
as being raised in Rule 506 offerings was $849 billion compared to $985 billion raised in
registered offerings. 194 Of the $849 billion, operating companies reported raising $71
billion, while pooled investment funds reported raising $778 billion. 195 More generally,
when including offerings pursuant to other exemptions – Rule 144A, Regulation S and
Section 4(a)(2) – significantly more capital appears to be raised through exempt offerings
than registered offerings (Figure 1). 196

193

In calculating the amount of capital raised by registered investment funds, we use the net amounts (plus
reinvested dividends and reinvested capital gains), which reflect redemptions, and not gross amounts, by
open-ended registered investment funds because they face frequent redemptions and do not have
redemption restrictions and lock-up periods common among private funds. In addition, we use the new
issuances of registered closed-end funds and the new deposits of registered unit investment trusts. See
2013 Investment Company Institute Factbook, available at: http://www.icifactbook.org.

Figure 1: Capital Raised in U.S. Capital Markets during 2009-2012 197

At present, issuers are required to file a Form D not later than 15 days after the
first sale of securities in a Regulation D offering and an amendment to the Form D only
under certain circumstances. Since issuers are not required to submit a Form D filing
when an offering is completed, and submit amendments only under certain
circumstances, we have no definitive information on the final amounts raised. Figure 2,
below, illustrates that at the time of the Form D filing, only 39% of offerings by nonpooled investment fund issuers were completed relative to the total amount sought.
Separately, 70% of pooled investment funds state their total offering amount to be
“Indefinite” in their Form D filings. As a result, the Form D filings of these pooled
investment funds likely do not accurately reflect the total amount of securities offered or
sold.

197

The 2012 non-ABS Rule 144A offerings data is based on an extrapolation of currently available data
through May 2012 from Sagient Research System’s Placement Tracker database. For more detail, see the
Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

Affected Market Participants

The amendments to Rule 506 we are adopting today will affect a number of
different market participants. Issuers of securities in Rule 506 offerings include both
reporting and non-reporting operating companies and pooled investment funds.
Investment advisers organize and sponsor pooled investment funds that conduct Rule 506
offerings. Intermediaries that facilitate Rule 506 offerings include registered brokerdealers, finders and placement agents. Investors in Rule 506 offerings include accredited
investors (both natural persons and legal entities) and non-accredited investors who meet
certain “sophistication” requirements. Each of these market participants is discussed in
further detail below.
a.

Issuers

Based on the information submitted in 112,467 new and amended Form D filings
between 2009 and 2012, there were 67,706 new Regulation D offerings by 49,740 unique
67

issuers during this four-year period. 198 The size of the average Regulation D offering
during this period was approximately $30 million, whereas the size of the median
offering was approximately $1.5 million. 199 The difference between the average and
median offering sizes indicates that the Regulation D market is comprised of many small
offerings, which is consistent with the view that many smaller businesses are relying on
Regulation D to raise capital, and a smaller number of much larger offerings.
Some information about issuer size is available from Item 5 in Form D, which
requires issuers in Regulation D offerings to report their size in terms of revenue ranges
or, in the case of certain pooled investment funds, net asset value ranges. All issuers can
currently choose not to disclose this size information, however, and a significant majority
of issuers that are not pooled investment funds declined to disclose their revenue ranges
in the Forms D that they filed between 2009 and 2012. For those that did, most reported
a revenue range of less than $1 million (Figure 3). 200 During the 2009-2011 period,
approximately 10% of all public companies raised capital in Regulation D offerings; in
2012, approximately 6% of such companies did so. 201 These public companies tended to
be smaller and less profitable than their industry peers, which illustrates the significance
of the private capital markets to smaller companies, whether public or private. 202
198

See Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

199

See id. A study of unregistered equity offerings by publicly-traded companies over the period 19801996 found that the mean offering amount was $12.7 million, whereas the median offering amount was
$4.5 million. See Michael Hertzel, Michael Lemmon, James Linck and Lynn Rees, Long-Run Performance
Following Private Placements of Equity, 57 Journal of Finance 2595 (2002).

Figure 3: Distribution of Non-Pooled Investment Fund Issuers in Regulation D
Market by Revenue: 2009-2012

During this period, pooled investment funds conducted approximately 24% of the
total number of Regulation D offerings and raised approximately 81% of the total amount
of capital raised in Regulation D offerings. 203 More than 75% of pooled investment
funds declined to disclose their net asset value range.

69

Figure 4: Distribution of Pooled Investment Fund Issuers in Regulation D Market
by Net Asset Value: 2009-2012

Between 2009 and 2012, approximately 66% of Regulation D offerings were of
equity securities, and almost two-thirds of these were by issuers other than pooled
investment funds. 204 Non-U.S. issuers accounted for approximately 19% of the amount
of capital raised in Regulation D offerings, indicating that the U.S. market is a significant
source of capital for these issuers. 205
Unlike in Regulation D offerings, issuers conducting Rule 144A offerings are not
required to disclose information about their offerings to the Commission, which limits
our ability to measure the size of the Rule 144A market. Based on transaction

204

Id.

205

Id.

70

information collected by third-party data providers, 206 we can broadly characterize the
Rule 144A market as being divided between ABS and non-ABS offerings. These sources
indicate that, over the four-year period from 2009 to 2012, there were 3,510 non-ABS
Rule 144A offerings by 1,965 unique issuers. During this period, the average non-ABS
offering size was approximately $526 million, while the median non-ABS offering size
was $350 million. These offering sizes are significantly larger than the average and
median amounts of Regulation D offerings, as discussed above, indicating that the Rule
144A market, as compared to the Regulation D market, is characterized by much larger
issues (which we presume correlate to larger issuers, as well) and, based on the number
of Rule 144A offerings, far fewer issuers. Another significant difference from
Regulation D offerings is the type of security offered. During this period, over 99% of
the non-ABS offerings in the Rule 144A market were debt offerings, 207 compared to 13%
of Regulation D offerings. 208
b.

Investors

We have relatively little information on the types and number of investors in Rule
506 offerings. Form D currently requires issuers in Rule 506 offerings to provide
information about the total number of investors who have already invested in the offering
and the number of persons who do not qualify as accredited investors. 209 In 2012,

206

These statistics are based on a review of data from Securities Data Corporation’s New Issues database
(Thomson Financial) and Sagient Research System’s Placement Tracker database.

(Thomson Financial) and Sagient Research System’s Placement Tracker database.
208

See Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

209

See Item 14 of Form D. Form D does not require any other information on the types of investors, such
as whether they are natural persons or legal entities.

71

approximately 153,000 investors participated in offerings by operating companies, while
approximately 81,000 investors invested in offerings by pooled investment funds. 210
Because some investors participate in multiple offerings, these numbers likely
overestimate the actual number of unique investors in these reported offerings. In
offerings under Rule 506(b), both accredited investors and up to 35 non-accredited
investors who meet certain sophistication requirements are eligible to purchase securities.
In offerings under new Rule 506(c), only accredited investors will be eligible to purchase
securities.
Information collected from Form D filings indicates that most Rule 506 offerings
do not involve broad investor participation. More than two-thirds of these offerings have
ten or fewer investors, while less than 5% of these offerings have more than 30 investors.
Although Rule 506 currently allows for the participation of non-accredited investors who
meet certain sophistication requirements, such non-accredited investors reportedly
purchased securities in only 11% of the Rule 506 offerings conducted between 2009 and
2012. 211 Only 8% of the offerings by pooled investment funds included non-accredited
investors, compared to 12% of the offerings by other issuers. 212

210

Number of Investors

As stated above, between 2009 and 2012, the size of the median Regulation D
offering, based on the information in Form D filings, was approximately $1.5 million.
The presence of so many relatively small offerings suggests that a sizable number of
current investors in Rule 506 offerings are natural persons or legal entities in which all
equity owners are natural persons. This is because smaller offerings may not provide
sufficient scale for institutional investors to earn a sizable return. Institutional investors
typically have a larger investible capital base and more formal screening procedures
compared to investors who are natural persons, and the associated costs of identifying
potential investments and monitoring their investment portfolio lead them to make larger

73

investments than natural persons. 213 As for whether natural persons investing in these
offerings are accredited investors or non-accredited investors, almost 90% of the
Regulation D offerings conducted between 2009 and 2012 did not involve any nonaccredited investors. 214
While we do not know what percentage of investors in Rule 506 offerings are
natural persons, the vast majority of Regulation D offerings are conducted without the
use of an intermediary, 215 suggesting that many of the investors in Regulation D offerings
likely have a pre-existing relationship with the issuer or its management because these
offerings would not have been conducted using general solicitation. This category of
investors is likely to be much smaller than the total number of eligible investors for Rule
506(c) offerings, which is potentially very large. We estimate that at least 8.7 million
U.S. households, or 7.4% of all U.S. households, qualified as accredited investors in
2010, based on the net worth standard in the definition of “accredited investor” (Figure
6). 216

213

See, e.g., George Fenn, Nellie Liang and Stephen Prowes, The Economics of Private Equity Markets
(1998); Steven Kaplan and Per Strömberg, Leveraged Buyouts and Private Equity, 23 Journal of Economic
Perspectives 121 (2009).
214

See Ivanov/Bauguess Study.

215

An analysis of all Form D filings submitted between 2009 to 2012 shows that approximately 11% of all
new offerings reported sales commissions of greater than zero because the issuers used intermediaries. See
Ivanov/Bauguess Study. We assume that the lack of a commission indicates the absence of an
intermediary.
216

This estimate is based on net worth and household data from the Federal Reserve Board’s Triennial
Survey of Consumer Finances 2010. Our calculations are based on all 32,410 observations in the 2010
survey.

74

Figure 6: Number of U.S. Households that Qualify as Accredited Investors Based
on 2010 Net Worth

Our analysis, however, leads us to believe that only a small percentage of these
households are likely to participate in securities offerings, especially exempt offerings.
First, as mentioned above, data from Form D filings in 2012 suggests that fewer than
234,000 investors (of which an unknown subset are natural persons) participated in
Regulation D offerings, which is small compared to the 8.7 million households that
qualify as accredited investors. Second, evidence suggests that only a small fraction of
the total accredited investor population has significant levels of direct stockholdings.
Based on an analysis of retail stock holding data for 33 million brokerage accounts in
2010, only 3.7 million accounts had at least $100,000 of direct investments in equity
securities issued by public companies listed on domestic national securities exchanges,
while only 664,000 accounts had at least $500,000 of direct investments in such equity

75

securities (Figure 7). 217 Assuming that investments in publicly-traded equity securities
are a gateway to investments in securities issued in exempt offerings, and accredited
investors with investment experience in publicly-traded equity securities are more likely
to participate in an exempt offering than accredited investors who do not, the set of
accredited investors likely to be interested in investing in Rule 506(c) offerings could be
significantly smaller than the total accredited investor population.

the characteristics of their investors, the information available on the number and types of
QIBs in the Rule 144A market is not broadly known, and is generally available only to
those financial intermediaries who act as initial purchasers in the offerings.

Investment Advisers

As of December 2012, there were 10,870 Commission-registered investment
advisers that filed Form ADV with the Commission, representing approximately $50
trillion total assets under management. 219 The average investment adviser registered with
the Commission has assets under management of approximately $4.6 billion; the median
size of assets under management for these registered investment advisers is $258 million.
Approximately one-fourth of registered investment advisers (2,842) currently
advise (or advised) private funds that filed Form D between 2002 and 2012, while
another 1,250 registered investment advisers currently advise (or advised) private funds
that did not file Form D during the same period. The registered investment advisers
advising private funds that submitted Form D filings during this period had average
assets under management of $8.7 billion, while the ones advising private funds that did
not submit Form D filings had average assets under management of $8.6 billion.
Registered investment advisers that did not advise private funds (6,623) are considerably
smaller, with average assets under management of $2.1 billion.

218

Non-U.S. investors generally do not participate in Rule 144A offerings; rather, they participate in
Regulation S offerings. Issuers will frequently conduct side-by-side Rule 144A and Regulation S offerings.
219

For the same time period, 2,303 exempt reporting advisers filed a Form ADV with the Commission.
Certain investment advisers that are ineligible to register with the Commission may also be exempt from
registration with any state.

77

d.

Broker-Dealers

As of December 2012, there were 4,450 broker-dealers registered with the
Commission who file on Form X-17A-5, with average total assets of approximately $1.1
billion per broker-dealer. The aggregate total assets of these registered broker-dealers are
approximately $4.9 trillion. Of these registered broker-dealers, 410 are dually registered
as investment advisers. The dually registered broker-dealers are larger (average total
assets of $6.4 billion) than those that are not dually registered. Among the dually
registered broker-dealers, we identified 24 that currently have or have had private funds
that submitted Form D filings between 2002 and 2012.
3.

Current Practices

The extent of the economic impact of the amendments to Rule 506 will depend on
the current practices of issuers and market participants in Rule 506 offerings. As issuers
in the Regulation D market are not required to disclose in Form D how they formed a
reasonable belief that the purchasers in their Rule 506 offerings are accredited investors
or sophisticated investors and are not currently required to take reasonable steps to verify
the accredited investor status of these purchasers, the Commission does not have any data
on current verification practices used in such offerings, if any. Commenters, however,
provided examples of current practices of how issuers collect information from a
potential purchaser to form a reasonable belief that he or she is an accredited investor.
One commenter suggested that a large number of issuers rely on lists of accredited
investors created and maintained by a reliable third party, such as registered broker-

78

dealers, 220 which would be consistent with the Commission’s view that an issuer would
not contravene Rule 502(c)’s prohibition against general solicitation if the issuer or its
agent has a pre-existing substantive relationship with the offerees. 221 Other commenters
asserted that many issuers rely on the services of placement agents to obtain information
about accredited investor status and to complete a Rule 506 transaction. 222 One
commenter stated that the most common practice was a combination of an investor
suitability questionnaire and investor self-certification. 223 These commenters, however,
did not provide data to allow for an estimate of the frequency of usage and the costs
associated with these practices.
C.

Analysis of the Amendment to Rule 506

Congress has mandated that we eliminate the prohibition against general
solicitation for a subset of Rule 506 offerings. 224 Below, we analyze the benefits and
costs associated with the amendments to Rule 506 in light of the baseline discussed
above. Because existing Rule 506 has always been subject to the prohibition against

222

See letters from SIFMA and FSR (Oct. 5, 2012); IAA.

223

See letters from NSBA; MFA (May 4, 2012) (noting that, in the hedge fund industry, a potential hedge
fund investor must complete “a subscription document provided by the fund’s manager that provides a
detailed description of, among other things, the qualification standards that a purchaser must meet under the
federal securities laws”).
224

The legislative history of a bill that was introduced (but not adopted) at or around the time of the JOBS
Act may be instructive with respect to how Congress viewed the effect of eliminating the prohibition
against general solicitation in private offerings. In its report on a bill that would have amended Section
4(a)(2) of the Securities Act to permit the use of general solicitation, the House Committee on Financial
Services stated that “regulations such as the prohibition of general solicitation and advertising in
Regulation D Rule 506 offerings inhibit capital formation.” Access to Capital for Job Creators Act, H.R.
Rep. 112-263, at 2 (2011). Accordingly, “[t]he legislation would allow companies greater access to
accredited investors and to new sources of capital to grow and create jobs, without putting less
sophisticated investors at risk.” Id.

general solicitation, there are significant data and informational limitations on our ability
to quantify the economic impact of eliminating that prohibition in certain Rule 506
offerings. As discussed above, we do not believe that the Form D filings available on the
Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system
present a complete view of the Rule 506 market, as there are some Rule 506 offerings for
which a Form D is not filed and the information presented in the Forms D that are filed is
not necessarily comprehensive. 225 In addition, as discussed below, we believe that there
are sufficient differences between Rule 504, as amended to permit general solicitation
from 1992 to 1999, and Rule 506(c) such that it would not be useful to look to the Rule
504 market during that period to make meaningful predictions as to the type or magnitude
of the effects of eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation for Rule 506(c)
offerings. For example, the amount of capital that could be raised under Rule 504, as
amended during this period, was capped at $1 million over a 12-month period; the
securities in a Rule 504 offering could be sold to an unlimited number of non-accredited
investors; and the securities sold in Rule 504 offerings were not restricted securities for
purposes of resale. We provide below a qualitative analysis of the potential costs and
benefits of eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation in certain Rule 506
offerings, supplementing that analysis with quantification, where possible, based on
existing data.
225

Because filing a Form D is not a condition for relying on Regulation D, commenters have noted that
many issuers do not file a Form D when raising capital under Rule 506. Issuers are currently required to
file an initial Form D within 15 days of the first sale of securities, but are required to report additional sales
through amended filings only under certain conditions, which means that in many cases, the total amount of
capital raised in a Regulation D offering is not reported on Form D. Finally, issuers do not report all
required information, either due to error or because they do not wish to make the information public. For
example, issuers have the option in Form D to decline to disclose their revenues or net asset values.

80

1.

Benefits to Issuers

The elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation for a subset of Rule
506 offerings will enable issuers to solicit potential investors directly, through both
physical (such as mailings, newspaper advertisements and billboards) and electronic
(such as the Internet, social media, email and television) means. As a result, we
anticipate that issuers will be able to reach a much greater number of potential investors
than is currently the case, thereby increasing their access to sources of capital. We note
that many commenters, including those representing small businesses, biotechnology
companies and angel investors, stated that the elimination of the prohibition against
general solicitation will facilitate capital formation by allowing businesses, particularly
early-stage companies, to solicit investments from a larger pool of investors. 226 This
could increase overall capital formation if issuers that previously did not raise capital
from individual investors because it was too costly to solicit them through intermediaries
now choose to solicit investors directly using general solicitation in accordance with Rule
506(c). Alternatively, if issuers use new Rule 506(c) in lieu of other methods of raising
capital, such as registered offerings or unregistered non-Rule 506(c) offerings, then Rule
506(c) would replace one source of capital for another, thereby potentially improving the
efficiency of capital flow through lower issuance costs, but not necessarily increasing the
gross amount raised.
We believe that it is reasonable to conclude that allowing issuers to have wider
access to accredited investors by eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation
for a category of Rule 506 offerings will significantly improve their access to capital and
226

See, e.g., letters from BIO; NSBA.

81

potentially enhance capital formation and lower the issuance cost. Although the lack of
available data on the economic impact of eliminating the prohibition against general
solicitation in Rule 506 offerings precludes us from quantifying the magnitude of this
effect, the Commission has some evidence of the effect of the availability of general
solicitation on issuers’ ability to raise capital based on information about the number of
Rule 504 offerings from 1992 to 2001, which covers the period during which the
prohibition against general solicitation was lifted for Rule 504, 227 and subsequently
reinstated in 1999. 228 In particular, and as shown in the chart below, the number of Rule
504 offerings increased at an average annual rate of 10.6% from 1992 through 1999. 229
In 2000, following the reinstatement of the ban, the number of Rule 504 offerings
declined by almost 44%. This decline is coincident with the general market decline in
2000, including the collapse of the Internet bubble, which may have been the cause or at
least a significant contributing factor to the rate of decline. During 2000, however, there
was not a concurrent decline in either the number of Rule 505 offerings or the number of
Rule 506 offerings. To the contrary, the number of Rule 506 offerings increased by
about 54% in 2000, while the number of Rule 505 offerings remained largely unchanged
(Figure 8). Declines in the numbers of Rule 505 and Rule 506 offerings followed in
2001, when presumably both types of offerings were negatively affected by the general
market decline, although Rule 504 offerings experienced a sharper decline (-35%)
compared to Rule 506 offerings (-30%). While it is not possible to disentangle the

broader market effects in 2000 from the reinstatement of the prohibition against general
solicitation on the number of Rule 504 offerings, the steady increase in the number of
Rule 504 offerings during the seven-year period following the elimination, in 1992, of the
prohibition against general solicitation and the subsequent sharp decline in the number of
Rule 504 offerings is consistent with the view that issuers’ ability to generally solicit may
enhance their ability to raise capital.
Figure 8: Number of New Regulation D Offerings: 1992-2001

The development of the venture capital (VC) industry in the United States may
also be a relevant example to illustrate the potential for enhanced capital formation that
may result from allowing issuers to have access to a wider range of investors. Under the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, pension fund managers are
subject to a “prudent man” standard of care in making investments. 230 Prior to 1979,
there was uncertainty under the U.S. Department of Labor’s then-existing interpretations
230

29 U.S.C. 1104(a).

83

of this standard as to whether pension funds could invest in venture capital and start-up
companies. In 1979, the Department clarified its interpretation of this standard by
indicating that portfolio diversification is a factor in determining whether an investment
is prudent, which indicated that pension funds would not be precluded from making
investments in VC funds. 231 Following this regulatory change, the VC industry
experienced substantial growth: VC commitments increased from $218 million in 1978
(of which pension funds supplied approximately 15%) to $3 billion in 1988 (of which
pension funds supplied approximately 46%). 232
We also anticipate that allowing issuers to solicit potential investors directly will
lower the direct costs of Rule 506 offerings. Although none of the commenters provided
data on direct cost savings, and although Form D filings do not present a complete view
of the market, we do have estimates of the direct offering costs paid by issuers that use an
intermediary to locate investors in Rule 506 offerings. An analysis of all Form D filings
submitted between 2009 to 2012 shows that approximately 11% of all new Regulation D
offerings reported sales commissions of greater than zero because the issuers used
intermediaries. 233 The average commission paid to these intermediaries was 5.9% of the
offering size, with the median commission being approximately 5%. Accordingly, for a
$5 million offering, which was the median size of a Regulation D offering with a
commission during this period, an issuer could potentially save up to $250,000 if it
solicits investors directly rather than through an intermediary, minus the cost of its own

solicitation efforts and the cost associated with verifying accredited investor status. 234
This potential benefit would likely be larger on a percentage basis for smaller offerings.
During this four-year period, of the issuers that paid a commission in connection with a
Regulation D offering, issuers raising up to $1 million in capital paid on average a 6.5%
commission, whereas issuers raising over $50 million in capital paid on average a 1.9%
commission. 235
Even for issuers that do not currently use an intermediary, allowing issuers to
generally solicit would likely lower the search costs associated with finding accredited
investors who would be interested in a particular offering, thus enhancing economic
efficiency. 236 If lower search costs expand the pool of interested investors for offerings,
there could be greater competition among investors, thereby lowering the costs of capital
for issuers. 237
The elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation would also reduce
the uncertainty for issuers as to whether a Rule 506 offering can be completed in certain
situations, and would eliminate the costs of complying with the prohibition. 238 Under
existing Rule 506, an inadvertent release of information about an offering to entities or
persons with whom the issuer does not have a pre-existing substantive relationship has
234

We recognize that intermediaries can provide benefits to issuers in addition to locating investors. For
example, an intermediary may be able to help an issuer obtain better pricing and terms or provide access to
investors that can provide strategic or other advice to the issuer. An intermediary could also provide
accreditation services. Unfortunately, we do not have data to quantify these benefits.

them results in higher valuations for issuers. See Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner, Money Chasing Deals?

been viewed by some as raising questions about the issuer’s ability to rely on the
exemption for the entire offering. 239 In addition, some private funds have been reluctant
to respond to press inquiries or to correct inaccurate reports due to concerns about these
discussions being misconstrued as a general solicitation. 240 Under Rule 506(c), any such
uncertainty as to the availability of the exemption due to the public disclosure of
information will be reduced. Nevertheless, there is no data available to quantify or
estimate these effects.
2.

Benefits to Investors

The elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation in Rule 506(c)
offerings will likely increase the amount and types of information about issuers and
offerings that are communicated to investors, which could also lead to more efficient
pricing for the offered securities. In addition, accredited investors who previously have
found it difficult to find investment opportunities in Rule 506 offerings may be able to
find and potentially invest in a larger and more diverse pool of potential investment
opportunities, which would result in a more efficient allocation of investments by
accredited investors. 241 Thus, Rule 506(c) could increase capital formation and at the

239

See, e.g., letter from S. Lorne and J. McLaughlin (Aug. 5, 2008) on Release No. 33-8828 (stating that
“[o]n occasion, the prohibition forces issuers to delay or even cancel offerings because of communications
– sometimes inadvertent – that could be viewed in hindsight as a solicitation. The need to police
communications by transaction participants, and to analyze and remedy inadvertent communications, also
adds significantly to the cost of effecting private placements.”).
240

See, e.g., letters from D.E. Shaw & Co. (Apr. 3, 2006) on Exposure Draft of Final Report of Advisory
Committee on Smaller Public Companies, Release No. 33-8666 (Feb. 28, 2006); MFA (May 4, 2012).

This benefit may not be applicable with respect to every issuer (e.g., certain private funds that offer
their shares continuously at net asset value).

86

same time improve its allocative efficiency. 242 One commenter argued that we do not
provide data to support the statements that accredited investors need new opportunities or
cannot find new opportunities under the current rules prohibiting the use of general
solicitation in Rule 506 offerings. 243 While we do not have data to test the validity of
these statements since general solicitation has heretofore been prohibited in Rule 506
offerings, economic theory suggests that expanding investors’ opportunities for
investment generally results in more efficient allocation of capital. For example, one
seminal study suggests that if some investors have incomplete information and are not
aware of all firms in the economy, risk sharing is incomplete and inefficient. 244
Information that makes investors aware of the existence of these firms and enlarges the
investor base leads to improved risk sharing and lower cost of capital.
With respect to private funds in particular, in the Proposing Release, we noted
that eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation would allow accredited
investors to gather information about private funds at relatively lower costs and to
allocate their capital more efficiently. 245 Increased information about private fund
strategies, management fees and performance information would likely lead to greater
competition among private funds for investor capital.

242

Allocative efficiency is a condition that is reached when resources are allocated in a way that allows the
maximum possible net benefit from their use. In this context, it means the right number of dollars from the
right types of investors going to the most suitable investments on efficient terms.

Petition”).

87

Some commenters noted that greater transparency about private funds’ activities
would benefit investors in these funds, and communications about these activities would
be subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and FINRA
regulations on the preparation of marketing materials. 246 Other commenters believed that
private funds engaging in general solicitation should be subject to form, content and/or
other restrictions, such as performance and advertising standards that are analogous to the
standards that are applicable to mutual funds in order to engage in general solicitation. 247
One of the commenters suggested that the Commission develop a rule tailored to the
ways private funds calculate and present performance, rather than extending mutual fund
performance rules to private funds. 248 With respect to private funds sold through brokerdealers subject to FINRA’s rules of conduct, some commenters believed that we should
direct FINRA to require the filing and review of private fund advertisements. 249
While the lack of data does not allow us to quantify the costs and benefits of
eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation under Rule 506(c) for private
funds, we believe that the potential for an increase in fraudulent or deceptive issuer
behavior due to the elimination of the prohibition may be limited to some extent by the
competitive nature of the private funds industry as well as by the fact that there are often
repeat interactions between private funds and their investors. 250

Costs

Eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation could result in heightened
fraudulent activity in Rule 506(c) offerings because it will be easier for promoters of
fraudulent schemes to reach potential investors through general solicitation. An increase
in fraud would not only harm those investors who are defrauded, it would undermine
investor participation in Rule 506(c) offerings and could negatively affect capital-raising
by legitimate issuers – for example, by reducing investor participation in Rule 506(c)
offerings – thereby inhibiting capital formation and reducing efficiency. One commenter
was concerned that investors may confuse private funds with registered investment
companies. 251 In such cases, fraud that occurs with private funds may cause investors to
associate the wrongdoing with registered investment companies, and therefore refrain
from investing in registered investment companies. In addition, some issuers with
publicly-traded securities may use general solicitation for a purported Rule 506(c)
offering to generate investor interest in the secondary trading markets, especially in the
over-the-counter markets, which could be used by insiders to resell securities at inflated
prices. This would impose costs to investors in these secondary markets, as well as
investors in Rule 506(c) offerings, and could erode investor participation in Rule 506(c)
offerings, thus potentially raising the cost of capital for issuers in this market. As
discussed above, we cannot quantify these potential costs because the existence of the
prohibition against general solicitation in Rule 506 offerings until now means that data on
the economic impact of eliminating the prohibition is not available.

Several commenters echoed concerns regarding the potential of fraud related to
private funds in the Rule 506(c) market. 252 Empirical evidence on the extent of fraud
involving private funds is not readily available. While a few economic studies suggest
that certain hedge funds engage in various types of misreporting, such as misrepresenting
past performance, 253 delaying disclosure of returns 254 and inflating returns at the end of
the fiscal year in order to earn higher fees, 255 these studies do not provide information
about the extent or magnitude of any such misreporting activities. In a 2003 report, the
Commission staff noted that there was no evidence that hedge funds were
disproportionately involved in fraudulent activity and that the charges brought by the
Commission in 38 enforcement actions against hedge fund advisers and hedge funds
between 1999 and 2003 were similar to the charges against other types of investment
advisers. 256 Evidence on the extent of fraud involving other types of pooled investment
funds also is sparse. A more recent study has identified 245 lawsuits (both federal and
state) involving 200 venture capitalists as defendants between 1975 and 2007, and has
shown that VC funds that are older and have a larger presence in terms of size and
network are less likely to be sued. 257

A number of commenters 258 noted the Commission’s experience with the
elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation for Rule 504 offerings in
1992, 259 and its subsequent reinstatement in 1999 as a result of heightened fraudulent
activity. 260 We do not believe that our experience with offerings conducted pursuant to
Rule 504, as amended in 1992, is particularly instructive with respect to the potential
incidence of fraud resulting from our implementation of Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act,
for a number of reasons. In 1992, when we amended Rule 504 to eliminate the
prohibition against general solicitation, we also provided that the securities issued in
these Rule 504 offerings would not be “restricted securities” for purposes of resale
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. 261 As a result, a non-reporting company
could sell up to $1 million of immediately freely-tradable securities in a 12-month period
and be subject only to the antifraud and civil liability provisions of the federal securities
laws.
By 1998, we concluded that securities issued in these Rule 504 offerings
facilitated a number of fraudulent secondary transactions in the over-the-counter markets,
and that these securities were issued by “microcap” companies, characterized by thin
capitalization, low share prices and little or no analyst coverage. 262 At that time, we
stated that, while “we believe that the scope of abuse is small in relation to the actual

1998) [63 FR 29168 (May 28, 1998)].

91

usage of the exemption, we also believe that a regulatory response may be necessary.” 263
As the freely-tradable nature of the securities facilitated the fraudulent secondary
transactions, we proposed to “implement the same resale restrictions on securities issued
in a Rule 504 transaction as apply to transactions under the other Regulation D
exemptions,” in addition to reinstating the prohibition against general solicitation.
Although we recognized that resale restrictions would have “some impact upon small
businesses trying to raise ‘seed capital’ in bona fide transactions,” we believed that such
restrictions were necessary so that “unscrupulous stock promoters will be less likely to
use Rule 504 as the source of the freely tradable securities they need to facilitate their
fraudulent activities in the secondary markets.” 264
In contrast, issuers using Rule 506(c) can sell only to accredited investors, and the
securities issued in these offerings are deemed to be “restricted securities” for purposes of
resale under Rule 144. As a result, schemes involving price manipulation to defraud
unknowing investors in the immediate resale of securities purchased directly from issuers
(colloquially referred to as “pump and dump” schemes) 265 are not the types of fraud we
believe are likely to occur in Rule 506(c) offerings, given the holding period requirement
in Rule 144(d) and other structural impediments, such as restricted transfer legends on
stock certificates.

92

The risks to investors of fraudulent offerings conducted under Rule 506(c) may be
mitigated to some extent by the requirement that issuers sell only to accredited investors
(and take reasonable steps to verify such status), who, by virtue of meeting the
requirements of the definition, may be better able to assess their ability to take financial
risks and bear the risk of loss than investors who are not accredited investors. Issuers
will still be subject to the antifraud provisions under the federal securities laws, and the
public nature of these solicitations may also facilitate detection of fraudulent activity in
that the fraudulent nature of some offerings may be inferred from particular statements
contained in solicitation materials, for example, representations of guaranteed high rates
of return.
Several commenters asserted that satisfying the definition of accredited investor
does not equate to financial sophistication and that it is questionable whether accredited
investors will be better able to identify the financial risks of the offerings and detect
fraudulent offerings as compared to non-accredited investors. 266 They also noted that the
income test and the net worth test have been significantly eroded by inflation. These
commenters also stated that not all general solicitation activities are widely known or
accessible, and that fraudulent offerings sold through telemarketing calls and email
solicitations, for example, will be difficult if not impossible to detect until after
significant damage has occurred.
4.

Indirect Effects on Other Markets

Although Rule 506(c) will directly affect the private offering market, it could also
have an indirect effect on other markets. The lower search costs associated with finding
266

See, e.g., letters from Consumer Federation; Fund Democracy.

93

Rule 506(c) offerings may cause some investors that currently invest in public equity and
debt markets or other non-registered offering markets to reallocate capital to offerings
made under Rule 506(c). If a significant number of investors make a greater proportion
of their investments in Rule 506(c) offerings, such investor behavior may reduce the
supply of capital and prices in the public equity and debt markets and in other nonregistered offering markets. For example, issuers currently using the exemptions in
Regulation A under the Securities Act 267 and in Rules 504(b)(1)(i) through (iii) of
Regulation D 268 to solicit investors could prefer to rely on the exemption under Rule
506(c) because they would be able to raise unlimited amounts of capital under Rule
506(c) and state blue sky securities registration requirements do not apply to Rule 506(c)
offerings. 269 Although it is difficult to estimate how many of these issuers will choose to
rely on Rule 506(c) in lieu of other available exemptions from registration, we believe
that it is likely that Rule 506(c) will have a larger impact on issuers using Rule 504 rather
than Regulation A because very few issuers have been using the Regulation A exemption
in recent years. 270 In addition, to the extent that accredited investors have invested in
registered investment companies instead of private funds because of information
asymmetry between private funds and registered investment companies, it is possible that
registered investment companies’ assets may decrease if these investors now transfer

The Ivanov/Bauguess Study reported that 1,852 issuers relied on the Rule 504 exemption to raise
capital between 2009 to 2012, and 20 issuers relied on Regulation A. The number of issuers using
Regulation A to raise capital may increase once the Commission adopts rules implementing Title IV of the
JOBS Act, which directs the Commission to adopt an exemption based on Regulation A to permit offerings
of up to $50 million.

their assets to private funds. Because we cannot predict how issuers will use the various
exemptions from registration after the elimination of the prohibition against general
solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings, we cannot quantify these potential effects.
5.

Retention of Rule 506(b)

We believe that retaining existing Rule 506(b) will have benefits for both issuers
and investors. It will allow issuers that do not wish to generally solicit in their private
offerings to avoid the added expense of complying with the rules applicable to Rule
506(c) offerings. It will also allow issuers to continue selling privately to up to 35 nonaccredited investors who meet existing Rule 506’s sophistication requirements. The
continued availability of Rule 506(b) may also be beneficial to investors with whom the
issuer has a pre-existing substantive relationship and who do not wish to bear additional
verification costs that may be associated with participation in Rule 506(c) offerings. All
but one commenter supported the Commission’s decision to retain Rule 506(b). 271
D.

Verifying Accredited Investor Status in Rule 506(c) Offerings

As there is no information available to us on the costs currently incurred by
issuers to form a reasonable belief that a purchaser in a Rule 506 offering is an accredited
investor, we are unable to quantify the estimated costs and benefits of the verification
requirement in Rule 506(c). Comments from the public on this issue also did not provide
any estimates.

271

See, e.g., letters from ABA Fed. Reg. Comm.; ACA (Sept. 27, 2012); CFIRA; IPA; Montgomery &
Hansen; NSBA; NYCBA; S&C; SIFMA and FSR (Oct. 5, 2012). Only one commenter opposed retaining
it. Letter from J. McLaughlin (stating that “[t]here is no basis in the statute for the Commission to continue
to apply the prohibition to a set of offerings exempt under Rule 506, especially since the effect of
maintaining a parallel rule may have the effect of discouraging some issuers from using general
solicitation….”).

95

The requirement in Rule 506(c) for issuers to take reasonable steps to verify that
purchasers are accredited investors will likely make it more difficult for issuers to sell
securities to non-accredited investors. This, in turn, may reduce the likelihood that
fraudulent offerings would be completed because those who are eligible to purchase are
more likely to be able to protect their interests than investors who are not accredited
investors. Issuers would also benefit from measures that improve the integrity and
reputation of the Rule 506(c) market because the measures would facilitate investor
participation, which could result in issuers having greater access to capital.
The verification requirement in Rule 506(c) would impose costs as well. Because
the requirement is to take “reasonable” steps to verify, and not every conceivable step to
verify, it is possible that some investors in Rule 506(c) will not be accredited investors,
even if the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify their status as accredited investors. If
so, then these investors will participate in offerings for which they are not qualified and
that may not be appropriate for them, thereby resulting in a potentially inefficient
allocation of capital for these investors. These investors could also face an additional
cost in the form of heightened risk of significant losses on their investments, which they
may not be able to manage or diversify in a way that accredited investors could.
In addition, some potential investors likely would have to provide more
information to issuers than they currently provide, while issuers may have to apply a
stricter and more costly process to determine accredited investor status than what they
currently use. While commenters provided us with examples of the methods currently
used by issuers in the Rule 506 market to collect information about purchasers, they did
not provide any data on the costs of these methods. While it is reasonable to expect that

96

the costs associated with the verification requirement could be offset somewhat by its
benefits, it is also reasonable to expect that some accredited investors who would
participate in existing Rule 506(b) offerings would decline to participate in Rule 506(c)
offerings in light of the verification requirement.
To the extent that issuers require investors to provide personally identifiable
information (e.g., Social Security numbers, tax information, bank or brokerage account
information) in order to verify their accredited investor status, these investors may be
reluctant to do so in the context of making an investment in an issuer, particularly an
issuer with which they may have no prior relationship. 272 In addition to concerns about
maintaining personal privacy, investors may be concerned that their personally
identifiable information could be stolen or accessed by third parties or used by
unscrupulous issuers in various ways (e.g., identity theft), which could impose costs to
investors that go well beyond the costs typically associated with investing. As a
consequence, some potential investors may elect not to participate in Rule 506(c)
offerings, thus impeding capital formation to some extent.
Our decision not to specify the verification methods that an issuer must use in
taking reasonable steps to verify accredited investor status would provide issuers with the
flexibility to use methods that are appropriate in light of the facts and circumstances of
each offering and each purchaser. Such flexibility could mitigate the cost to issuers of
complying with Rule 506(c) because it would allow them to select the most cost-effective
verification method for each offering. We anticipate, however, that issuers or their
verification service providers will document the particular verification methods used in
272

See letter from SecondMarket Holdings, Inc. (May 25, 2012).

97

the event of any question being raised about the availability of the exemption. Although
we do not specify the nature or extent of any such documentation, we acknowledge that it
will create some cost.
On the other hand, the greater flexibility of the principles-based “reasonableness”
verification method could result in less rigorous verification, thus allowing some
unscrupulous issuers to more easily sell securities to purchasers who are not accredited
investors and perpetrate fraudulent schemes, or it could create or promote legal
uncertainty about the availability of Rule 506(c), which may cause some issuers to
interpret “reasonable steps to verify” in a manner that is more burdensome than if specific
verification methods were prescribed, thus incurring higher cost. We believe that the
non-exclusive list of specific methods of verification we are including in Rule 506(c), as
adopted, should help to mitigate the impact of these costs.
Some commenters suggested that using a flexible verification standard is optimal
for issuers because it closely resembles current market practices which they believe have
worked well in this market. 273 Such flexibility will allow issuers to adopt different
approaches based on the types of accredited investors, types of offerings and changing
market practices. In contrast, other commenters questioned the benefits of the flexibility
provided by the principles-based verification method and criticized the Commission for
not quantifying the costs and benefits of currently used verification methods. 274 They
argued that the application of the reasonableness standard in the principles-based method

273

See letters from SIFMA and FSR (Oct. 5, 2012); and IAA.

274

See letters from Consumer Federation; Fund Democracy.

98

will lead to lax verification practices by issuers, which would lessen investor protection
by allowing sales of securities to non-accredited investors.
Our decision to provide a non-exclusive list of specified methods that issuers can
use to verify a purchaser’s accredited investor status will provide legal certainty in those
circumstances in which there is a question as to whether or not the steps taken are
reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances. Using a specified method would
reduce issuers’ verification costs to the extent that they would otherwise incur costs to
analyze whether or not the steps they had taken or proposed to take satisfied the
reasonableness standard in Rule 506(c). It could also reduce investors’ costs, since the
methods for verifying income and net worth rely mostly on documents prepared by third
parties at no cost to the investors. On the other hand, some investors may be reluctant to
provide the personal financial information required by the income and net worth
methods; and with respect to the third-party method, it may be relatively costly to pay for
the verification services of a lawyer or accountant as they may be concerned about
professional liability. The grandfather method – which permits self-certification by
existing investors who purchased securities as accredited investors in an issuer’s Rule
506(b) offering before the effective date of Rule 506(c) – could result in investors that do
not meet the definition of “accredited investor” participating in Rule 506(c) offerings
because issuers conducting Rule 506(b) offerings are not required to take reasonable
steps to verify the accredited investor status of their purchasers.
In addition, our non-exclusive list of specified verification methods could be
mistakenly viewed by market participants as the required verification methods, in which
compliance with at least one of the enumerated methods could be viewed, in the practical

99

application of the verification requirement, as necessary in all circumstances to
demonstrate that the verification requirement has been satisfied, thereby eliminating the
flexibility that Rule 506(c) is intended to provide. 275 If issuers choose not to use
verification methods different from those on the non-exclusive list, then some potential
investors may limit their participation in the Rule 506(c) market, which may impede
capital formation to some extent. Finally, even if a specified method has been used,
thereby satisfying the verification requirement, there may be circumstances in which
issuers may unreasonably overlook or disregard other information indicating that a
purchaser is not, in fact, an accredited investor. This could lead to sales being made to
persons who are not accredited investors. Because, as stated above, the Commission does
not have data on current verification practices, we cannot quantify the effect of the new
verification requirement in Rule 506(c).
E.

Analysis of the Amendment to Rule 144A

We expect the potential benefits of the amendments to Rule 144A to be lower
(i.e., less available) for issuers in Rule 144A offerings as compared to issuers in Rule
506(c) offerings because QIBs, which are the only permitted investors in Rule 144A
offerings, are generally fewer in number, known by market participants, and better
networked than accredited investors. Thus, as we noted in the Proposing Release, we
believe that eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation for Rule 144A
offerings is unlikely to dramatically increase issuers’ access to QIBs in such offerings or
to lower the cost of capital in Rule 144A offerings.
275

The use of any of the specified methods is optional. We expect that many issuers will conduct Rule
506(c) offerings in reliance on the principles-based method of verification, in light of its flexibility and
efficiency.

100

We expect that there would be fewer potential occurrences of general solicitationinduced fraud in Rule 144A offerings, as compared to Rule 506(c) transactions, because
Rule 144A offerings involve an intermediary that, as the initial purchaser of the
securities, typically performs a due diligence investigation and assists the issuer in
preparing the offering materials, thereby adding a layer of protection against fraud. Also,
Rule 144A investors are generally large institutions, which are thought to be better able
to identify fraudulent activities than smaller institutions and retail investors in general.
We also anticipate that eliminating the prohibition against general solicitation
would significantly affect private trading systems by permitting information vendors to
provide more information about Rule 144A securities. Indeed, because offers will be
able to be made to the public, the information on private trading systems for Rule 144A
securities could be made available to all investors, even though sales would be limited to
QIBs. 276 In addition, currently there is no public dissemination through Trade Reporting
and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”) of transactions in Rule 144A securities. 277 Now that
Rule 144A is being amended to permit offers to be made to persons other than QIBs,
transaction information with respect to Rule 144A securities can be publicly
disseminated. Such improvements in the information available to potential investors
could enhance efficiency in the Rule 144A market.
276

Under the PORTAL Trading System developed by the Nasdaq Stock Market for trading Rule 144A
securities, access is restricted to QIBs. Other privately developed Rule 144A trading systems, such as
Portal Alliance, have similar restrictions.
277

See FINRA Rule 6750. There is mandatory reporting of over-the-counter trades in fixed income
securities. On April 19, 2013, the FINRA Board of Governors announced that it has authorized FINRA to
file with the Commission “proposed amendments to FINRA Rules 6750 and 7730 to provide for the
dissemination of transactions in TRACE-eligible securities effected pursuant to Securities Act Rule 144A
(Rule 144A transactions).” See Letter from Richard G. Ketchum, Chairman and CEO, FINRA (Apr. 19,
2013), available at: http://www.finra.org/Industry/Regulation/Guidance/CommunicationstoFirms/P244913.

F.

Additional Information Collection and Disclosures

We are amending Form D to add a new check box in Item 6 of Form D that will
require an issuer to indicate whether it is relying on Rule 506(c) in conducting its
offering. With this information, the Commission will be able to more effectively analyze
the use of Rule 506(c). The marginal cost to issuers of providing this information is
likely to be low because Form D already requires issuers to identify the exemption on
which they are relying. Commenters generally supported the proposal to have a new
check box in Item 6 of Form D as a way to identify Rule 506(c) offerings. 278 One
commenter, however, questioned the usefulness of the information provided by the new
check box. 279
Much of what we know about the size and characteristics of the private offering
market comes from Form D filings. The information collected to date and described in
this release illustrates and underscores the importance of the private offering market to
the U.S. economy. The continued collection of this information following the
elimination of the prohibition against general solicitation in Rule 506(c) and Rule 144A
offerings will be an important tool in assessing the ongoing economic impact of the new
rule amendments.

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
This Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“FRFA”) has been prepared in

accordance with Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 280 It relates to the

279

280

See 5 U.S.C. 603.

102

amendments to Rules 500, 501, 502 and 506 of Regulation D, Form D and Rule 144A
that we are adopting in this release. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”)
was prepared in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and included in the
Proposing Release.
A.

Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Action

The primary reason for, and objective of, the amendments to Rule 502 and Rule
506 is to implement the statutory requirements of Section 201(a)(1) of the JOBS Act,
which directs the Commission to revise Rule 506 to provide that the prohibition against
general solicitation in Rule 502(c) shall not apply to offers and sales of securities made
pursuant to Rule 506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited
investors. Consistent with the language in Section 201(a), the amendment to Rule 506
requires issuers to take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers in any Rule 506 offering
using general solicitation are accredited investors. The primary reason for, and objective
of, the amendment to Form D is to assist our efforts to analyze the use of general
solicitation in Rule 506(c) offerings and the size of this offering market.
The primary reason for, and objective of, the final amendment to Rule 144A is to
implement the statutory requirements of Section 201(a)(2) of the JOBS Act, which
directs the Commission to revise Rule 144A(d)(1) to provide that securities sold pursuant
to Rule 144A may be offered to persons other than QIBs, including by means of general
solicitation, provided that securities are sold only to persons that the seller and any person
acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe are QIBs.
B.

Significant Issues Raised By Public Comments

In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on any aspect of the IRFA,
including the number of small entities that would be subject to the proposed rule and
103

form amendments and the nature of the effects of the proposed amendments on small
entities. We received one comment addressing the IRFA. 281 This commenter stated that
the Commission failed in its IRFA to consider the alternative of eliminating Form D or
significantly reducing the scope of information required to be disclosed on Form D. As
Form D provides meaningful information about the Regulation D market, and our need
for information about this market will only increase once Rule 506(c) is in effect, we are
not considering eliminating Form D or significantly reducing the scope of information
required to be disclosed on Form D.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Final Rule and Form Amendments

For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, under our rules, an issuer, other
than an investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization” if it has total
assets of $5 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or
proposing to engage in an offering of securities which does not exceed $5 million. 282 For
purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, an investment company is a small entity if it,
together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment
companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal
year. 283
Rule 506(c) will affect small issuers (including both operating businesses and
investment funds that raise capital under Rule 506) relying on this exemption from
Securities Act registration. All issuers that sell securities in reliance on Regulation D are

281

See letter from K. Bishop.

282

17 CFR 230.157.

283

17 CFR 270.0-10(a).

104

required to file a Form D with the Commission reporting the transaction. For the year
ended December 31, 2012, 16,067 issuers made 18,187 new Form D filings, of which
15,208 issuers relied on the Rule 506 exemption. Based on the information reported by
issuers on Form D, there were 3,958 small issuers 284 relying on the Rule 506 exemption
in 2012. This number likely underestimates the actual number of small issuers relying on
the Rule 506 exemption, however, because over 60% of issuers that are not pooled
investment funds and over 80% of issuers that are pooled investment funds declined to
report their amount of revenues in 2012.
The final amendment to Rule 144A will affect small entities that engage in Rule
144A offerings. 285 Unlike issuers that use Regulation D, issuers conducting Rule 144A
offerings are not required to file any form with the Commission. This lack of data
significantly limits our ability to assess the number and the size of issuers that conduct
Rule 144A offerings. Still, we are able to obtain some data on non-ABS Rule 144A
offerings during the 2009 to 2012 period from two commercial databases. 286 Based on
these data, we identified 3,510 offerings involving 1,965 issuers from 2009 to 2012. We
were able to obtain 2011 financial information for 598 of these issuers, 287 of which only
11 issuers reported total assets of less than $50 million.
284

Of this number, 3,627 of these issuers are not investment companies, and 331 are investment
companies. We also note that issuers that are not investment companies disclose only revenues on Form D,
and not total assets. Hence, we use the amount of revenues as a measure of issuer size.
285

While it may be theoretically possible for a small entity to meet one part of the definition of “qualified
institutional buyer” (e.g., an “entity, all of the equity owners of which are qualified institutional buyers,
acting for its own account or the accounts of other qualified institutional buyers”), we do not have any
information to suggest that there are such small entities. Accordingly, the regulatory flexibility analysis in
regard to Rule 144A is focused on small issuers that engage in Rule 144A offerings.
286

These databases are Thomson Financial’s SDC Platinum Service and Sagient Research System’s
Placement Tracker database.

287

Financial data for fiscal year 2011 was obtained from Compustat, a product of Standard and Poor’s.

105

D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance
Requirements

The final amendment to Rule 506 will impose certain reporting and compliance
requirements on issuers that engage in general solicitation in Rule 506 offerings. As
discussed above, issuers taking advantage of Rule 506(c) to engage in general solicitation
in Rule 506 offerings will be required to take reasonable steps to verify that the
purchasers of the securities are accredited investors. The steps required will vary with
the circumstances, but we anticipate that some potential investors may have to provide
more information to issuers than they currently provide, while issuers may have to apply
a stricter and more costly process to verify accredited investor status than what they
currently use. We expect that the costs of compliance will vary depending on the size
and nature of the offering, the nature and extent of the verification methods used, and the
number and nature of purchasers in the offering. Rule 506(c) does not impose any
recordkeeping requirements; however, we anticipate that issuers or their verification
service providers will document the steps taken to verify that purchasers are accredited
investors in Rule 506 offerings involving general solicitation because the issuer has the
burden of demonstrating that its offering is entitled to an exemption from the registration
requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act. To promote legal certainty, we are
including in Rule 506(c) a non-exclusive list of verification methods that in and of
themselves will be deemed to satisfy the verification requirement.
The final amendment to Form D will also impose an information requirement
with respect to Rule 506 offerings that use general solicitation. Each issuer submitting a
Form D for a Rule 506 offering will be required to check a box on the form to indicate
whether the issuer is relying on the Rule 506(c) exemption. We do not believe that this
106

revision to Form D will increase in any material way the time or information required to
complete the Form D that must be filed with the Commission in connection with a Rule
506 offering.
The final amendment to Rule 144A contains no reporting, recordkeeping or
compliance requirements for issuers that engage in Rule 144A offerings.
E.

Duplicative, Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules

The Commission believes that there are no rules that duplicate, overlap or conflict
with the final amendments to Rule 144A, Form D, and Rules 500, 501, 502 and 506 of
Regulation D.
F.

Significant Alternatives

The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider significant alternatives that
would accomplish the stated objectives of our amendments, while minimizing any
significant adverse impact on small entities. In regard to the final amendment to Rule
144A and the final amendment to Rule 506 to remove the prohibition against general
solicitation in Rule 506 offerings where all purchasers are accredited investors and
issuers have taken reasonable steps to verify purchasers’ accredited investor status, there
are no significant alternatives to these amendments that would accomplish the stated
objectives of Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act. Eliminating the prohibition against general
solicitation for a subset of Rule 506 offerings is intended to assist small entities – and
other entities – seeking to raise capital. Small entities are not required to use Rule 506(c)
to raise capital and would do so presumably only if it would be useful to them.
In connection with the final amendment to Form D and the final amendment to
Rule 506 that requires issuers to take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers of
securities are accredited investors, the Commission considered the following alternatives:
107

(1) establishing different compliance or reporting standards that take into account the
resources available to small entities; (2) clarifying, consolidating or simplifying
compliance requirements under the rule; (3) using design rather than performance
standards; and (4) exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of the amendment
to Rule 506.
With respect to using design rather than performance standards, we note that the
“reasonable steps to verify” requirement in Rule 506(c) is a performance standard. We
believe that the flexibility of a performance standard accommodates different types of
offerings and purchasers without imposing overly burdensome methods that may be illsuited or unnecessary to a particular offering or purchaser, given the facts and
circumstances. The Commission is not adopting different compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables for small entities under Rule 506(c). The particular steps
necessary to meet the requirement to take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers are
accredited investors will vary according to the circumstances. Different compliance
requirements for small entities may create the risk that the requirements may be too
prescriptive or, alternatively, insufficient to verify a purchaser’s accredited investor
status. Special requirements for small entities may also lead to investor confusion or
reduced investor participation in Rule 506 offerings if they create the impression that
small entities have a different standard of verification than other issuers of securities. As
the verification requirement is intended to protect investors by limiting participation in
unregistered offerings to those who are most able to bear the risk, we are of the view that
a flexible standard applicable to all issuers better accomplishes the goal of investor
protection that this requirement is intended to serve. At the same time, the non-exclusive

108

list of verification methods that we are including in the final rule will provide additional
legal certainty to all issuers, including small entities. The Commission is not adopting a
different reporting requirement for small entities because the additional information that
will be required in Form D is minimal and should not be unduly burdensome or costly for
small entities.
We similarly believe that it does not appear consistent with the objective of the
final amendments or the considerations described above regarding investor confusion and
investor participation to further clarify, consolidate or simplify the amendments for small
entities. With respect to exempting small entities from coverage of these final
amendments, we believe such an approach would be contrary to the requirements of, and
the legislative intent behind, Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act, as evidenced by the plain
language of the statute.
