ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING, SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE,
AND TO SHOW CAUSE

On February 12, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings.
On February 22, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP by February 20, 2016, in accordance
with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Respondents’ answers were
therefore due by March 4, 2016. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). To date,
Respondents have not filed answers.
Accordingly, I ORDER that on or before March 17, 2016, Respondents shall SHOW
CAUSE why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their
failures to file answers or otherwise defend this proceeding. If Respondents fail to respond to
this order, they will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against them, and
the registrations of their securities will be revoked. OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
I FURTHER ORDER that the hearing currently scheduled for March 14, 2016, is
POSTPONED, and a telephonic prehearing conference shall be held at 3:00 p.m. EDT on April
11, 2016, if the proceeding is not resolved before then.
