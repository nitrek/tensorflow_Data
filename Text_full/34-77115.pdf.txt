EXTENSION ORDER

Respondents Strategic Consulting Advisors, LLC and David I. Osunkwo
(collectively, the “Moving Respondents”) have requested an extension until February 12,
2016 to respond to the Division of Enforcement’s (“Division”) opposition to their
pending Motion to Sever. The Division does not object to the extension.
Extensions of time are disfavored. It appears appropriate, however, to grant a
brief extension. Therefore,
It is ORDERED that Moving Respondents’ reply brief is due February 12, 2016.
No further extensions will be granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Jill M. Peterson
Assistant Secretary
