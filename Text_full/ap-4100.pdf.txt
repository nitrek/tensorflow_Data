ORDER TO SHOW
CAUSE AS TO THREE
RESPONDENTS

On August 9, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission, failed to
timely report the termination of the auditor-client relationship, and are delinquent in their
periodic filings.
On August 25, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., John D. Oil and Gas Company,
Legal Life Plans, Inc., and Powder River Coal Corp. were served with the OIP by August 11,
2016, in accordance with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). 1 These
Respondents’ answers were due by August 24, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.160(b),
.220(b). On August 24, 2016, John D. Oil and Gas, through its bankruptcy trustee, submitted
an answer. To date, Capitol City, Legal Life Plans, and Powder River Coal have not filed
answers.
Accordingly, Respondents Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., Legal Life Plans, Inc., and
Powder River Coal Corp. are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE by September 8, 2016, why the
registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file
answers or otherwise defend the proceeding. If these Respondents fail to respond to this
