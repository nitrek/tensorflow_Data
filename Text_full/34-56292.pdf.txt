ORDER APPROVING
APPLICATION OF FUND
ADMINISTRATOR FOR
COMPENSATION AND
REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES

On June 2, 2005, the Commission filed a settled civil action and issued an order in a
settled administrative proceeding against Huntington Bancshares, Inc. (“Huntington”), its CEO,
former CFO, and former controller. Huntington paid a penalty of $7.5 million and the three
individuals paid disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties totaling $1,134,484. In the
administrative proceeding, the Commission charged that Huntington and the three officers,
Thomas E. Hoaglin, Michael J. McMennamin, and John Van Fleet, violated or caused
Huntington’s violations of certain provisions of the antifraud, books and records, internal
controls and recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Each respondent agreed to cease and desist from committing and/or causing the
violations charged and any future violations of the provisions. The June 2, 2005 Order and the
Final Judgment directed that all of the monies be paid to the Office of Financial Management
(“OFM”) and used to create a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002. All amounts have been paid and are being held awaiting distribution.
On December 29, 2005, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution
of Disgorgement Fund and Opportunity for Comment by Non-Parties (“Proposed Plan”) (Rel.
No. 34-53035). The Proposed Plan provides that the Fair Fund be distributed to claimants who
purchased shares of Huntington common stock between January 18, 2003 and 4:00 p.m. June 26,
2003 (“Relevant Purchase Period”) and sold between 4:00 p.m. June 26, 2003 and 4:00 p.m. July
3, 2003 (“Relevant Sale Period”) at a loss. The Proposed Plan also provides for the appointment
of Nancy Grunberg, Esq. of the law firm Venable LLP as Plan Administrator for the purpose of
administering the Plan of Distribution. The Proposed Plan states that the Plan Administrator
shall file a quarterly report reflecting the status of the distribution, in addition to an application
for payment of reasonable fees and for reimbursement of reasonable costs and expenses for

completed services with the Commission. The Proposed Plan also states that the Plan
Administrator shall seek to amend the Distribution Plan to further specify the procedures to be
used to administer the plan. On March 16, 2006, the Commission approved the Proposed Plan
(Rel. No. 34-53495).
On April 20, 2006, the Plan Administrator submitted a detailed invoice of fees and
expenses incurred through the first quarter of 2006, and its first status report. On July 26, 2006,
the Commission authorized the payment of the Plan Administrator’s fees and expenses from the
Disgorgement Fund (Rel. No. 34-54218).
The Plan Administrator subsequently filed a Modified Plan in which it amended certain
definitions of the Distribution Plan and set forth additional information regarding the procedures
to be used to distribute the Fair Fund. On August 15, 2006, the Commission published a Notice
of Modified Plan of Distribution of Disgorgement Fund. On October 2, 2006, the Commission
approved the Modified Plan (Rel. No. 34-54554).
On July 20, 2006, the Plan Administrator submitted a detailed invoice of fees and
expenses incurred through the second quarter of 2006, and its second status report. On October
27, 2006, the Commission authorized the payment of the Plan Administrator’s fees and expenses
from the Disgorgement Fund (Rel. No. 34-54663).
On April 16, 2007, the Plan Administrator submitted a detailed invoice of fees and
expenses incurred during the third and fourth quarters of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 along
with a status report for the same period. The Commission staff, having reviewed the Plan
Administrator’s invoice and report, finds the fees and expenses of $13,471.46 to be reasonable
and in accordance with the Plan of Distribution. The Commission staff has requested that the
Commission authorize OFM to pay the Plan Administrator’s fees and expenses of $13,471.46
from the Disgorgement Fund.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1105(d) of the Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, that OFM pay the Plan
Administrator’s fees and expenses in the amount of $13,471.46 and any future fees and expenses
up to, but not to exceed, $75,000 per invoice from the Disgorgement Fund.
By the Commission.
