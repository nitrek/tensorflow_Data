File No. S7-15-16/Proposed Rule: Disclosure Update and Simplification
Dear Mr. Fields:
The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) is the
worldwide voice for REITs and real estate companies with interests in U.S. real
estate and capital markets. NAREIT’s members are REITs and other real estate
businesses throughout the world that own, operate and finance commercial and
residential real estate.
NAREIT supports the goals of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(SEC) Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative and on July 21, 2016 submitted
comments on SEC’s Concept Release, Business and Financial Disclosure
Required by Regulation S-K, which was subject to a ninety (90) day comment
period. NAREIT respectfully requests that the comment period for its
subsequently proposed rule, Disclosure Update and Simplification, File No. S715-16 (Proposed Rule), also be extended to a full ninety (90) days.
The Proposed Rule poses many important questions and suggestions that may
impact NAREIT members. We are concerned that 60 days (a period that
included previously scheduled summer vacations) may not be sufficient for
NAREIT and its members to analyze these carefully. We therefore respectfully
request that the SEC extend the comment period to 90 days, as the SEC
permitted for its recent Concept Release Business and Financial Disclosure
Required by Regulation S‐K.

Sincerely,

Victoria P. Rostow
Senior Vice President, Policy & Regulatory Affairs
