Proceedings Instituted Against California-based Audit Firm and Two of Its Accountants
For Alleged Improper Professional Conduct and Audit Failures
Feb. 11, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the issuance of an
Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings against California-based
audit firm Frazer Frost LLP and two of its accountants, engagement partner Susan Woo and
manager Miranda Suen (together, the “Auditors”), alleging multiple instances of improper
professional conduct and audit failures during their third quarter 2010 review of interim
financial information and their 2011 year-end audit of China Valves Technology, Inc.
The SEC’s Enforcement Division and Office of the Chief Accountant allege that, during
Frazer Frost’s third quarter 2010 interim review:
• The Auditors learned from China Valves’ CEO that certain material information
concerning China Valves’ January 2010 acquisition of Watts Valve (Changsha) Co.,
Ltd. was misstated or not included in the notes to the financial statements for the first
and second quarter 2010 Forms 10-Q.
• The Auditors performed procedures which confirmed that the information in the prior
Forms 10-Q was materially misstated and proposed corrections to the third quarter
Form 10-Q in Frazer Frost’s workpapers.
• Despite proposing corrections, Frazer Frost’s workpapers did not document that the
Auditors communicated the inaccuracies and proposed changes to China Valves’
management or its audit committee.
• Despite their awareness of the inaccuracies, Woo and Suen signed off on Frazer
Frost’s third quarter 2010 review of China Valves’ interim financial information, and
the company filed its Form 10-Q with the SEC that repeated the material
misstatements from the two previous quarters concerning the acquisition.
The SEC’s Enforcement Division and Office of the Chief Accountant further allege that,
during Frazer Frost’s 2011 year-end audit of China Valves:
• While recognizing the need to exercise heightened professional skepticism during the
audit, the Auditors failed to follow their audit plan to perform extended procedures to
test $1.7 million in value-added-tax (“VAT”) payments purportedly made to a local
tax bureau by China Valves’ Pudong Hanwei Valve Co., Ltd. subsidiary. They also
failed to replace those procedures with adequate alternatives or to document why
those procedures were no longer necessary.
• Instead, in contravention of the risks they had identified, Respondents relied solely on
information provided by China Valves and, in doing so, failed to obtain sufficient
audit evidence.
• As a result of this failure, the Auditors did not learn that Hanwei Valve had not made
the $1.7 million in VAT payments as recorded in China Valves’ books and records
and reported in the 2011 financial statements included in Form 10-K.
• Frazer Frost subsequently issued an audit report containing an unqualified opinion as
to China Valves’ 2011 financial statements, which materially misstated the company’s
tax liabilities.

The Enforcement Division and the Office of the Chief Accountant allege that Frazer Frost
engaged in improper professional conduct under Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice and willfully violated Rules 2-02 and 2-06 of Regulation S-X, that Woo and Suen
engaged in improper professional conduct under Rule 102(e), that Woo caused Frazer
Frost’s violations of Rules 2-02 and 2-06 of Regulation S-X, and that Suen caused Frazer
Frost’s violations of Rules 2-06.
The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before an administrative law judge for
proceedings to adjudicate the Enforcement Division’s and the Office of the Chief
Accountant’s allegations and determine what, if any, remedial actions are appropriate.
This action is the latest from the Cross-Border Working Group that focuses on companies
with substantial foreign operations that are publicly traded in the U.S. The Working Group
has enabled the SEC to file fraud cases against more than 120 foreign issuers or executives,
at least another 25 non-fraud cases involving at least 40 other defendants and respondents,
most of whom were auditors and other gatekeepers, and deregister the securities of more
than 145 companies.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Sarah Nilson, Patrick L. Feeney, and Janet Yang
and supervised by Melissa Hodgman. The litigation will be led by Alfred Day.
