INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT
January 21, 2016

APPEARANCES:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement, Securities and
Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting administrative
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on
December 8, 2015, alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission
and are delinquent in their periodic filings. Respondents were served with the OIP by December
16, 2015, and their answers were due by December 29, 2015. Cadan Res. Corp., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3428, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5226 (ALJ Dec. 22, 2015).
A telephonic prehearing conference was held on December 28, 2015, and though all
parties were sent a copy of the Order setting the prehearing conference, only the Division of
Enforcement appeared. Cadan Res. Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3454, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 1 (ALJ Jan. 4, 2016). I then ordered Respondents to show cause by January 15, 2016,
why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to
file answers, appear at the scheduled prehearing conference, or otherwise defend this proceeding.
Id. at 1-2. I warned that any Respondent that failed to respond to the order to show cause would
be deemed in default, the proceeding determined against it, and the registration of its securities
revoked. Id. at 2. To date, no Respondent has filed an answer, responded to the order to show
cause, or otherwise defended the proceeding.
Findings of Fact
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers, appear at the prehearing
conference, respond to a dispositive motion, or otherwise defend the proceeding. See OIP at 3;

17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f). Accordingly, I deem the OIP’s allegations to be true.
17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a).
Cadan Resources Corp., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1217332, is a British Columbia
corporation located in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with a class of securities
registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is
delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since
it filed a Form 20FR-12G registration statement on February 28, 2003. As of December 1, 2015,
the company’s stock (symbol “CADAF”) was traded on over-the-counter markets.
Consolidated Global Minerals Ltd., CIK No. 1172214, is a British Columbia corporation
located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20FR12G registration statement on April 22, 2002.
Doreal Energy Corp., CIK No. 1072147, is an Alberta corporation whose registration was
struck by Alberta’s corporate regulator for failure to file its annual return, and is located in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20FR-12G
registration statement on October 4, 2000.
GeoCan Energy Inc. (a/k/a Arsenal Energy Inc.), CIK No. 1143883, is an Alberta
corporation located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20FR12G registration statement on June 28, 2001.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations, or through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission, did not receive such letters.
Conclusions of Law
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1 require issuers of securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current and
accurate information in annual reports, even if the registration is voluntary under Exchange Act
Section 12(g). 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a); 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-1; see 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-1.
“Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from
the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC
LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), mot. for recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867,
2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). By failing to timely file required periodic reports,
Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-1.

Sanction
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or
rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect investors, the
Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the
isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the
issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of
its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because they violate a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file
periodic reports for several years. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008).
Respondents are culpable because they knew, or should have known, of their obligation
to file periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. § 249.310 (Commission Form 10-K); China-Biotics, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013)
(holding that revocation may be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware of its
reporting obligations); Robert L. Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260,
2011 SEC LEXIS 2722, at *40 n.60 (Aug. 5, 2011) (stating that the Commission has “repeatedly
held that ignorance of the securities laws is not a defense to liability thereunder”). By not
participating in this proceeding, Respondents forfeited an opportunity to show they have made
efforts to remedy their past violations and to offer assurances against further violations.
On these facts, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
Order
I ORDER that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Cadan Resources Corp.,
Consolidated Global Minerals Ltd., Doreal Energy Corp., and GeoCan Energy Inc. (a/k/a
Arsenal Energy Inc.), are REVOKED.

This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, I FURTHER ORDER
that a party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twelve days after service
of the initial decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(b). A party may also file a motion to correct a
manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule of Practice 111. See
17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party
shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the order resolving such
motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The initial decision will not become final until the
Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party.
In addition, a respondent has the right to file a motion to set aside a default within a
reasonable time, stating the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specifying the nature of
the proposed defense. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). The Commission can set aside a default at any time
for good cause. Id.
