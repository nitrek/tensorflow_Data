SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Release No. 78972 / September 29, 2016
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) announced the temporary
suspension, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), of trading in the securities of Sierra Resource Group, Inc. (“Sierra
Resource”) of Las Vegas, Nevada commencing at 9:30 a.m. EDT on September 29,
2016, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. EDT on October 12, 2016.
The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of Sierra Resource
because of questions concerning the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available
information about Sierra Resource because it has not filed a periodic report since filing its
Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2013, filed on November 19, 2013.
The Commission cautions brokers, dealers, shareholders, and prospective purchasers that
they should carefully consider the foregoing information along with all other currently
available information and any information subsequently issued by the company.
Further, brokers and dealers should be alert to the fact that, pursuant to Rule 15c2-11
under the Exchange Act, at the termination of the trading suspension, no quotation may
be entered unless and until they have strictly complied with all of the provisions of the
rule. If any broker or dealer has any questions as to whether or not he has complied with
the rule, he should not enter any quotation but immediately contact the staff in the
Division of Trading and Markets, Office of Interpretation and Guidance, at (202) 5515777. If any broker or dealer is uncertain as to what is required by Rule 15c2-11, he
should refrain from entering quotations relating to Sierra Resource’s securities until such
time as he has familiarized himself with the rule and is certain that all of its provisions
have been met. If any broker or dealer enters any quotation which is in violation of the
rule, the Commission will consider the need for prompt enforcement action.
Any broker, dealer or other person who has any information which may relate to this
matter should contact Chedly C. Dumornay, Assistant Regional Director, Miami
Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission at (305-982-6300).
