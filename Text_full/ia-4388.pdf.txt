SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
17 CFR Part 275
Release No. IA-4388; File No. S7-08-16
Performance-Based Investment Advisory Fees
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Notice of intent to issue order.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) intends to issue an
order that would adjust for inflation, as appropriate, dollar amount thresholds in the rule under
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that permits investment advisers to charge
performance-based fees to “qualified clients.” Under that rule, an investment adviser may
charge performance-based fees if a “qualified client” has a certain minimum net worth or
minimum dollar amount of assets under the management of the adviser. The Commission’s
order would increase, to reflect inflation, the minimum net worth that a “qualified client” must
have under the rule. The order would not increase the minimum dollar amount of assets under
management.
HEARING OR NOTIFICATION OF HEARING: An order adjusting the dollar amount tests
specified in the definition of “qualified client” will be issued unless the Commission orders a
hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission’s Secretary.
Hearing requests should be received by the Commission’s Office of the Secretary by 5:30 p.m.
on June 13, 2016. Hearing requests should state the nature of the writer’s interest, the reason for
the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request
notification by writing to the Commission’s Secretary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission intends to issue an order under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act” or “Act”). 1

BACKGROUND
Section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act generally prohibits an investment adviser from

entering into, extending, renewing, or performing any investment advisory contract that provides
for compensation to the adviser based on a share of capital gains on, or capital appreciation of,
the funds of a client. 2 Congress prohibited these compensation arrangements (also known as
performance compensation or performance fees) in 1940 to protect advisory clients from
arrangements that Congress believed might encourage advisers to take undue risks with client
funds to increase advisory fees. 3 In 1970, Congress provided an exception from the prohibition
for advisory contracts relating to the investment of assets in excess of $1,000,000, 4 if an

Act”) [15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(11)] are not eligible for this exception from the performance fee
prohibition under section 205(b)(2)(B) of the Advisers Act.

appropriate “fulcrum fee” is used. 5 Congress subsequently authorized the Commission to
exempt, by rule or order, any advisory contract from the performance fee prohibition if the
contract is with persons who the Commission determines do not need the protections of that
prohibition. 6
The Commission adopted rule 205-3 in 1985 to exempt an investment adviser from the
prohibition against charging a client performance fees in certain circumstances. 7 The rule, when
adopted, allowed an adviser to charge performance fees if the client had at least $500,000 under
management with the adviser immediately after entering into the advisory contract
(“assets-under-management test”) or if the adviser reasonably believed, immediately prior to
entering into the advisory contract, that the client had a net worth of more than $1,000,000 at the
time the contract was entered into (“net worth test”). The Commission stated that these
standards would limit the availability of the exemption to clients who are financially experienced
5

15 U.S.C. 80b-5(b). A fulcrum fee generally involves averaging the adviser’s fee over a specified
period and increasing or decreasing the fee proportionately with the investment performance of
the company or fund in relation to the investment record of an appropriate index of securities
prices. See rule 205-2 under the Advisers Act; Adoption of Rule 205-2 under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, As Amended, Definition of “Specified Period” Over Which Asset Value of
Company or Fund Under Management is Averaged, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 347
(Nov. 10, 1972) [37 FR 24895 (Nov. 23, 1972)].
In 1980, Congress added another exception to the prohibition against charging performance fees,
for contracts involving business development companies under certain conditions. See section
205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act.

Section 205(e) of the Advisers Act. Section 205(e) of the Advisers Act authorizes the
Commission to exempt conditionally or unconditionally from the performance fee prohibition
advisory contracts with persons who the Commission determines do not need its protections.
Section 205(e) provides that the Commission may determine that persons do not need the
protections of section 205(a)(1) on the basis of such factors as “financial sophistication, net
worth, knowledge of and experience in financial matters, amount of assets under management,
relationship with a registered investment adviser, and such other factors as the Commission
determines are consistent with [section 205].”

and able to bear the risks of performance fee arrangements. 8 In 1998, the Commission amended
rule 205-3 to, among other things, change the dollar amounts of the assets-under-management
test and net worth test to adjust for the effects of inflation since 1985. 9 The Commission revised
the former from $500,000 to $750,000, and the latter from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000. 10
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) 11
amended section 205(e) of the Advisers Act to provide that, by July 21, 2011 and every five
years thereafter, the Commission shall adjust for inflation the dollar amount thresholds included
in rules issued under section 205(e), rounded to the nearest $100,000. 12 In May 2011, the
Commission published a release (the “May 2011 Release”) that included a notice of intent to
issue an order revising the dollar amount thresholds of the assets-under-management test (from
$750,000 to $1,000,000) and the net worth test (from $1,500,000 to $2,000,000). 13 The
Commission issued an order to revise the dollar amount thresholds of the
assets-under-management and net worth tests, as described above, on July 12, 2011. 14

See 1985 Adopting Release, supra note 7, at Sections I.C and II.B. The rule also imposed other
conditions, including specific disclosure requirements and restrictions on calculation of

The May 2011 Release also proposed amendments to rule 205-3 providing, among other
things, that the Commission would issue an order every five years in the future adjusting the
rule’s dollar amount thresholds for inflation. 15 On February 15, 2012, the Commission adopted
these proposed amendments, which amended rule 205-3 in three ways to carry out the inflation
adjustment of the rule’s dollar amount thresholds. 16 First, the amendments revised the dollar
amount thresholds in rule 205-3, in order to codify the order the Commission issued on July 12,
2011. 17 Second, the amendments added to rule 205-3, as proposed, a new paragraph stating that
the Commission will issue an order on or about May 1, 2016, and approximately every five years
thereafter, adjusting for inflation the dollar amount thresholds of the rule’s
assets-under-management and net worth tests. 18 Finally, the amendments to rule 205-3 specify
the price index on which future inflation adjustments will be based—the Personal Consumption
Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index (“PCE Index”), which is published by the United States
Department of Commerce. 19 The PCE Index is an indicator of inflation in the personal sector of
the U.S. economy20 and is used in other provisions of the federal securities laws, including the

effective date and does not apply retroactively to contractual relationships previously in
existence.

DISCUSSION
A. Order Adjusting Dollar Amount Tests
Pursuant to section 418 of the Dodd-Frank Act and rule 205-3(e), today we are providing

notice 22 that the Commission intends to issue an order making the required inflation adjustment
to the assets-under-management test and the net worth test in the definition of “qualified client”
in rule 205-3. As discussed above, section 418 of the Dodd-Frank Act and rule 205-3(e) require
that we adjust the dollar amount thresholds of the rule by order on or about May 1, 2016 and
every five years thereafter. 23 We intend to issue an order that would maintain the dollar amount
of the assets-under-management test at $1,000,000, and would increase the dollar amount of the
net worth test from $2,000,000 to $2,100,000. As required under rule 205-3, both dollar
amounts would take into account the effects of inflation by reference to historic and current
levels of the PCE Index. While the dollar amount of the assets-under-management test would
not change, because the amount of the Commission’s inflation adjustment calculation is smaller

(adopting periodic inflation adjustments to the fixed-dollar thresholds for both “institutional
customers” and “high net worth customers” under Rule 701 of Regulation R); see also
Amendments to Form ADV, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3060 (July 28, 2010)
[75 FR 49234 (Aug. 12, 2010)] (increasing for inflation the threshold amount for prepayment of
advisory fees that triggers an adviser’s duty to provide clients with an audited balance sheet and
the dollar threshold triggering the exception to the delivery of brochures to advisory clients
receiving only impersonal advice).
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the use of the PCE Index to calculate inflation adjustments for
the cash limit protection of each investor under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970.

than the rounding amount specified under rule 205-3, the dollar amount of the net worth test
would be adjusted as a result of the Commission’s inflation adjustment calculation effected
pursuant to the rule. 24
We anticipate that future changes to the dollar amount tests that are issued by order will
be reflected in technical amendments to rule 205-3(d), which would be adopted after such order
is issued. 25
B. Effective Date
We anticipate that, if we issue the order described above, the effective date will be 60
days following the order date. 26 To the extent that contractual relationships are entered into prior
to the order’s effective date, the dollar amount test adjustments in the order would not generally
24

Specifically, rule 205-3(e) provides that the adjusted dollar amounts shall be computed by:
1) dividing the year-end value of the PCE Index (or any successor index thereto) for the calendar
year preceding the calendar year in which the order is being issued (in this case, 2015), by the
year-end value of the PCE Index (or successor) for the calendar year 1997 (such quotient, the
“Adjustment Percentage”); 2) for the assets-under-management test, multiplying $750,000 by the
Adjustment Percentage and rounding the product to the nearest multiple of $100,000; and 3) for
the net worth test, multiplying $1,500,000 by the Adjustment Percentage and rounding the
product to the nearest multiple of $100,000.
As of April 8, 2016, the end-of-year 2015 PCE Index was 109.819, and the end-of-year 1997 PCE
Index was 79.657. Assets-under-management test calculation to adjust for the effects of inflation:
(109.819/79.657) x $750,000 = $1,033,986.34; $1,033,986.34 rounded to the nearest multiple of
$100,000 = $1,000,000. Net worth test calculation to adjust for the effects of inflation:
(109.819/79.657) x $1,500,000 = $2,067,972.68; $2,067,972.68 rounded to the nearest multiple
of $100,000 = $2,100,000.
The values of the PCE Index are available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a bureau of the
United States Department of Commerce. See http://www.bea.gov; see also Bureau of Economic
Analysis, Table 2.3.4., “Price Indexes for Personal Consumption Expenditures by Major Type of
Product,” available at

See May 2011 Release, supra note 13, at n.27 (noting that the Commission anticipated, when it
issued its notice of intent to issue an order revising the dollar amount thresholds of the
assets-under-management test and the net worth test, that “future changes to the dollar amount
test that are issued by order, will be reflected in technical amendments to rule 205-3”).

When the Commission issued the 2011 Order adjusting the dollar amount tests of rule 205-3 as
described above, the 2011 Order’s effective date was approximately 60 days following its
issuance. See supra note 14.
