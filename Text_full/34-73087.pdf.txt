AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
MICHAEL LEE
MENDENHALL,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section
15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Section 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Michael Lee Mendenhall (“Mendenhall” or
“Respondent”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

Respondent Michael Lee Mendenhall, age 51, is a resident of Canon City, Colorado. From
June 2005 to November 2009, Mendenhall was associated with a broker-dealer and investment adviser
that was registered with the Commission. From January 2009 until October 2010, Mendenhall was
associated with a broker-dealer registered with the Commission.
B.

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

1.
On March 2, 2012, Mendenhall was convicted of 17 counts of securities fraud
in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. § 11-51-501(1), a class three felony, and eight counts of theft in

violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-4-401, a class three felony, before the District Court, City and
County of Denver, Colorado, in People v. Michael Lee Mendenhall, Case No. 2011CR10094. On
April 20, 2012, a judgment in the criminal case was entered against Mendenhall. Mendenhall was
sentenced to 30 years in prison, and ordered to pay $1,408,667.77 in restitution.
2.
One of the securities fraud counts on which Mendenhall was convicted
alleged that, between April 2006 and November 2010, Mendenhall, in connection with the offer,
sale, or purchase of a security, directly or indirectly, unlawfully, feloniously, and willfully engaged
in any act, practice, or course of business which operated, or would have operated as a fraud or
deceit upon any person in connection with purported residential real estate acquisition investments.
The remaining sixteen securities fraud counts on which Mendenhall was convicted alleged that, at
various times between April 2006 and November 2010, Mendenhall, in connection with the offer,
sale, or purchase of a security, directly or indirectly, unlawfully, feloniously and willfully made an
untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in
connection with purported residential real estate investments. The theft counts on which
Mendenhall was convicted alleged that, at various times between September 2005 and August 2010,
Mendenhall unlawfully, feloniously, and knowingly obtained or exercised control over investors’
money, without authorization, or by threat or decision, and knowingly used, concealed, or
abandoned the thing of value in such manner as to permanently deprive investors of its use or
benefit.
3.
At the time of the misconduct for which he was convicted, Mendenhall was
associated with a broker-dealer and investment adviser registered with the Commission and/or a
broker-dealer registered with the Commission.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act; and
C.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an

2

Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified mail.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
