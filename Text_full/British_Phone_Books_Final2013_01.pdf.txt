British Phone Books
BT Archives maintains a near complete collection
of original phone books for the United Kingdom
from 1880, the year after the public telephone
service was introduced into the UK. It also holds
phone books for Southern Ireland until 1921 and
the creation of Eire as a separate state. The
collection contains phone books produced by BT
and by the predecessor organisations from which
BT is directly descended, including Post Office
Telecommunications and private telephone
companies.

The phone books reflect the development of the
telephone service in the UK, covering exclusively
London when the telephone was first available;
they gradually expand to include major provincial
centres and are ultimately nationwide.
Preservation of the
collection

British Phone Books

Phone books were not intended
to be retained permanently, or
even beyond their current
status, with old phone books
returned to be pulped for reuse. This was particularly
important during the war and
immediate post-war period
because of a shortage of paper.
The paper used in their
production was also of poor
quality. As a result many of the
earlier phone books are in a
fragile condition, and have to
be conserved to ensure they
survive for the future.
In 1993-94, because of heavy
public usage and concern of

damage to the originals, the
collection up to 1992 was
microfilmed. BT Archives holds
the phone book on microfiche
for 1993-2000 so access to all
phone books from their creation
in 1880 to 2000 is through
microfilm (reels) or microfiche
(sheets) in BT Archives
searchroom, greatly assisting
preservation of the originals.
A 26-month digitisation project
was completed in conjunction
with Ancestry.co.uk to scan the
phone books from 1880 to 1984
and make them available online
through a subscription service.
The project digitised 1,780
phone books - more than 280
million names.

Making the phone
book
The rapidly developing
telephone network meant that
updated editions of the phone
book were required frequently,
with sometimes several editions
being produced in a year.
From 1913 onwards they were
generally produced twice a
year, and then from 1940
production was less frequent,
usually every 18 months.
The number of phone books
produced has increased
dramatically as the network has
expanded. By 1914 the phone
book was the largest single
printing contract in the UK, with
a million and a half phone
books being printed each year.
In 1921 approximately 1.7
million were issued, weighing a
total of about 1,000 tons. In
1938 the total number of phone
books published each year
British Phone Books

exceeded 10.5 million, with an
approximate weight of 10,600
tons. By 1951 of the 8 million
phone books printed and
distributed, over half had more
than 1,000 pages. In 2012,
22 million phone books were
published in 168 editions.
From 1970 onwards phone
books were compiled by
computer in Leeds, recorded
onto magnetic tape and fed into
photo composing machines.
This was the world’s first fully
integrated computer printing
process.
Production of the phone book
has been almost continuous
since 1880. The one exception
is for the period from 1913 to
1920. There is some doubt
whether, other than in London,
any phone books were
produced during this period,
although it is possible that they
were recycled for the war effort.

The BT historical phone book
collection includes phone books
(‘lists of subscribers’) from
some of the several telephone
companies that were formed in
the 1880s. By the mid 1890s
these companies had either
merged with or been taken over
by the sole remaining private
concern, the National
Telephone Company (NTC),
which ran the telephone service
in competition with the smaller
network of the Post Office. In
1896 the Post Office took over
the trunk (long distance)
network of the NTC, and finally
the whole company in 1912.
The arrangement of the phone
books varied considerably,
particularly in the earliest
issues, and it is only later that
any standardisation between
the Post Office and NTC
appears. For many years, the
different telephone systems of
the competing companies and
the Post Office were
incompatible, resulting in
customers being obliged to
confine themselves to the
network of one company or
subscribe to others.
This situation was not resolved
until the latter days of
competition when subscribers
of the NTC and the Post Office
were given access to the
other's system, and were listed
in the other's phone books as
well as their own.

Development of the
phone book
The arrangement of the phone
book has been reorganised
periodically to accommodate
the increasing numbers of
residential and business
subscribers, particularly
domestic customers, as the
telephone became available to
a wider audience.
In 1879 The Telephone
Company opened the first
telephone exchange in the UK
in Coleman Street in the City of
London, with only seven
subscribers. Demand grew
quickly, with other exchanges in
London opening within a year.
In its first year, The Telephone
Company handled 6,000 calls.
On 15 January 1880 The
Telephone Company issued the
first phone book containing 248
London personal and business
names, but without telephone
numbers. A caller simply rang
the exchange and asked to be
connected to another
subscriber listed in the phone
book. This system quickly
became impractical and by
April 1880 The Telephone
Company listed telephone
numbers for its subscribers.

Until 1938, each volume of the
phone book included an
alphabetical index indicating in
which telephone district a
particular location lay. These
indexes have been microfilmed
along with the phone book
information itself, which makes
phone books of this time
relatively easy to access and
search. After 1938, indexes to
the phone books were
produced independently and
not necessarily each year.
Copies of these are available in
the search room at BT Archives
dating from 1939 to 1991.
Prior to 1969, phone books
could be bound together into
volumes, which were arranged
according to a particular region
of the country, such as North of
England, South West and
South Wales. Although the
phone books could also be
issued separately, the
collection held by BT Archives
holds them in the bound
volume form.
In 1984 a new style Phone
Book was launched with
improved supplementary
information and an easier to
read format. This was initially
introduced in Manchester and
subsequently used nationwide.

In 1896 the first phone book for
the whole country was
published in one volume,
containing 1350 pages and
81,000 entries. By 1900 the
introduction of double columns
was necessary due to the
increase in the number of
entries.

A further major change to the
format of the phone book
happened with the launch of
The Phone Book from BT as a
combined book for residential,
business and classified entries.
York was the first place to get
this new style edition in January
2003.
An online version of the phone
book was launched in 2005.
In May 2006 Reading was the
first area to receive the new
look phone book with a restyled
front cover designed to make
people more aware of its
usefulness as a classified
directory.
From January 2010 the BT
Phone Book has been made
with 100 per cent recycled
paper and it became a compact
publication in July 2010 to fit
into letter boxes and save
2,000 tonnes of paper each
year.

London
In 1932 the London Telephone
Area was extended to include
some further outlying areas.
The area was renamed the
London Telecommunications
Region (LTR) in 1936, as part
of major organisational
changes within the Post Office.
From 1954 the arrangement of
the London phone book was
radically changed to cover only
the London postal area and
addresses with London
postcodes, with separate
volumes being produced for
outer London.

Telephone number
format
In 1926, when automatic
exchanges and dial telephones
were first introduced in London,
it was decided that all figure
numbers would be less
memorable than giving each
exchange a 'name' with a three
letter code. So, from 1926 the
first three letters of the names
of telephone exchanges
appeared in the phone book in
heavy print as part of a
telephone number, HARrow
0119, MAYfair 0541, HOLborn
1832. Callers would dial the
three letters (which appeared
on the telephone dial) and then
the four digit number. As
automatic exchanges replaced
manual exchanges across the
country this system was
expanded.
In 1966 the introduction of AllFigure Numbering (AFN)
replaced the letters and number

combination. AFN was
essential with the development
of direct international dialling,
as the mixed letter and number
combinations were insufficient
to meet the needs of expanding
service.
6 May 1990 saw the biggest
change to the London
telephone numbering system
since the introduction of All
Figure Numbering with the
code change from 01 to 071 for
inner London and 081 for outer
London. This was necessary
because of the growth in
demand for numbers and the
proliferation of 'number hungry'
equipment such as fax
machines and PBXs (Private
Branch/Business eXchange)
with direct dialling facilities.
Changing to 071 and 081
doubled the amount of
available London numbers. BT
had publicised the code
changes over the previous year
through television, radio,
newspapers, poster sites and
mailings. A code change party

at the BT Tower attended by
several celebrities marked the
actual changeover itself, which
was broadcast live on
television. 16 April 1995 was
nominated by Oftel as National
Code Change day, Phoneday.
The code change effectively
gave every geographic number
an extra '1' after the '0'. Leeds,
Bristol, Sheffield, Nottingham
and Leicester were given new
codes and new numbers were
introduced to cater for future
growth.
Despite these changes on 22
April 2000, new dialling codes
were introduced combined with
alterations to existing local
numbers for London,
Southampton, Portsmouth,
Coventry, Cardiff and Northern
Ireland.
