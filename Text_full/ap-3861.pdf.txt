ORDER RESCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

In the Matter of
DANIEL CHRISTIAN STANLEY POWELL

On April 19, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. On May 18, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration establishing that
Respondent was personally served with the OIP on May 9 at the Taft Correctional Institution in
Taft, California. Respondent’s answer is therefore due May 31, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.160(a), .220(b).
Today, I held a telephonic prehearing conference at which the Division appeared but
Respondent did not. Division counsel advised that Respondent was not at fault for his absence;
rather, Taft Correctional’s phone system does not permit inmates to dial in passcodes to join
teleconferences. The Division suggested rescheduling the conference, and said it would make
the necessary arrangements to allow Respondent to join.
The prehearing conference is RESCHEDULED to May 26, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern.
The Division shall make the necessary arrangements to allow Respondent to telephonically
participate.
