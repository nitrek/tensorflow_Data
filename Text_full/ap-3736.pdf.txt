In the Matter of
CHARDAN CHINA ACQUISITION CORP. AND
GARDEN BAY INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

ORDER FINDING RESPONDENTS IN
DEFAULT AND CANCELING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On February 25, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings. On March 1, 2016, I postponed the hearing in this matter and scheduled a
prehearing conference for April 7, 2016. Chardan China Acquisition Corp., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3660, 2016 SEC LEXIS 772.
Respondents were served with the OIP on February 27, 2016, and their answers were due
by March 11, 2016. Id. Following Respondents’ failures to timely file answers, I ordered each
Respondent to show cause by March 24, 2016, why the registration of its securities should not be
revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding.
Chardan China Acquisition Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3701, 2016 SEC LEXIS
975 (ALJ Mar. 14, 2016). I warned that if any Respondent failed to respond to the show cause
order, it would be deemed in default, the proceeding would be determined against it, and the
registration of its securities would be revoked. Id. To date, no Respondent has filed an answer
or responded to the show cause order. I therefore find Respondents in default.1 See 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.155(a)(2). An initial decision of default will be issued as to Respondents.

1

Respondents may move to set aside the default pursuant to Rule of Practice 155(b):
A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the
reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed
defense in the proceeding. In order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as
may be appropriate, the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of the initial
decision, or the Commission, at any time, may for good cause shown set aside a
default.

17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b).

Accordingly, I ORDER that the prehearing conference scheduled for April 7, 2016, is
CANCELED.
