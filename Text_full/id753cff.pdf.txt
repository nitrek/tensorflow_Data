INITIAL DECISION
March 11, 2015

Aaron P. Arnzen and Joseph P. Ceglio for the
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission
David Mura, pro se

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision (ID) concludes that no disgorgement or civil penalties will be
imposed on David Mura (Mura) due to his inability to pay.
I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
The Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) instituted this proceeding with
an Order Instituting Proceedings on September 24, 2012, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). On December 5, 2014,1 the Commission
issued an order (Continuation Order), pursuant to Mura’s offer of settlement, making various
findings of facts and conclusions of law and imposing a cease-and-desist order and other
sanctions on Mura and otherwise resolving all issues in this proceeding except for the
determination of whether Mura should be ordered to pay disgorgement and penalties and, if so,
the amount of such disgorgement and penalties.2 David Mura, Exchange Act Release No.
73754, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4750.

An Initial Decision was issued in the interim. David Mura, Initial Decision Release No. 491,
2013 SEC LEXIS 1700 (A.L.J. June 14, 2013). Thereafter, the Commission vacated the Initial
Decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. David Mura, Exchange Act Release
No. 72080, 2014 SEC LEXIS 1530 (May 2, 2014).

Familiarity with the findings of facts and conclusions of law in the Continuation Order is
assumed for the purpose of this ID.

As permitted by the Continuation Order, the determination concerning disgorgement and
penalties is being made by means of summary disposition, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250.
Continuation Order at ¶ IV.(d). As agreed upon by the parties, this determination is being made
through filings that include Mura’s Form D-A (17 C.F.R. § 209.1). See David Mura, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 2151, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4867 (A.L.J. Dec. 18, 2014). Accordingly, this ID is
based on: (1) Mura’s Form D-A and supplemental information received on January 20 and 27,
2015; and (2) the Division of Enforcement’s responsive submission, received on February 6, 2015.
These filings were submitted under seal and will be subject to a protective order pursuant to 17
C.F.R. § 201.322.3
II. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
As Mura has urged, and the Division does not dispute, Mura’s liabilities, including a
large outstanding judgment, far exceed the value of his assets, and he has a limited income.
Under these circumstances, in the public interest, Mura will not be ordered to pay disgorgement
or civil penalties. See Section 21B(d) of the Exchange Act;4 17 C.F.R. § 201.630(a).5 In fact, to
order him to pay disgorgement or penalties would be futile, as such a judgment would be
uncollectible.
In light of the above, Mura will not be ordered to pay disgorgement or civil penalties.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

Although the record in a public hearing is presumed to be public, the harm resulting from
disclosure of Mura’s financial situation outweighs the benefits. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.322(b).
Disclosure of financial information concerning an individual is presumed harmful. It is
specifically limited in various statutes, for example, Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information
Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4), and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. There is no benefit from
disclosure in this case.

Exchange Act Section 21B authorizes the Commission to impose a civil penalty in a
proceeding, such as this one, instituted pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(b). Section 21B(d)
provides:
In any proceeding in which the Commission . . . may impose a penalty under this
section, a respondent may present evidence of [his] ability to pay such penalty.
The Commission . . . may, in its discretion, consider such evidence in determining
whether such penalty is in the public interest. Such evidence may related to the
extent of such person’s ability to continue in business and the collectability of a
penalty, taking into account any other claims of the United States or third parties
upon such person’s assets and the amount of such person’s assets.
5

“The [Administrative Law Judge] may, in . . . her discretion, consider evidence concerning
ability to pay in determining whether disgorgement . . . or a penalty is in the public interest.”

This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to
that Rule, a party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days
after service of the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact within ten days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111(h) of the Commission’s Rules
of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a
party, then that party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the
undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact. The Initial
Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality. The
Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the Initial Decision shall not become
final as to that party.
