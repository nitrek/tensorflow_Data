INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT
March 23, 2016

APPEARANCE:

David S. Frye for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

On February 12, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that each Respondent has a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Exchange Act Section 12(g) and is delinquent in its required periodic filings.
Respondents were served with the OIP by February 20, 2016, and their answers were due
by March 4, 2016. Shearson Fin. Network, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3682, 2016
SEC LEXIS 883 (ALJ Mar. 7, 2016); Shearson Fin. Network, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3637, 2016 SEC LEXIS 677 (ALJ Feb. 24, 2016). Following Respondents’ failures
to timely file answers, I ordered each Respondent to show cause by March 17, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or
otherwise defend this proceeding. Shearson Fin. Network, Inc., 2016 SEC LEXIS 883. I warned
that any Respondent that failed to respond to the order to show cause or attend the prehearing
conference would be deemed in default, the proceeding would be determined against it, and the
registration of its securities would be revoked. Id.

A telephonic prehearing conference was held on March 11, 2016, and though
Respondents were sent copies of the order setting the prehearing conference, only the Division of
Enforcement appeared. In addition, to date, no Respondent has filed an answer or responded to
the show cause order. Thus, Respondents are in default. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of Practice 155(a), 17
C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.

In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failures to maintain
valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require issuers of securities
registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in annual and quarterly reports, even if the
registration is voluntary under Exchange Act Section 12(g). 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a); 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports and Rule
13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13.
“Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from
the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC
LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007
SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish violations of Exchange
Act Section 13(a) and rules thereunder. See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir.
1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). By failing to timely file required
periodic reports, Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13
thereunder.

SANCTION
Exchange Act Section 12(j) authorizes the Commission, “as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend the
registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity
for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the
Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because they violate a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that each repeatedly failed to file
periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009
SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864,
2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008).
Respondents are culpable because they knew, or should have known, of their obligations
to file periodic reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 249.308a, .310 (Commission Forms 10-Q, 10-K);
China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60
(Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that scienter is not necessary to establish grounds for revocation); Robert
L. Burns, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3260, 2011 SEC LEXIS 2722, at *41
n.60 (Aug. 5, 2011) (stating that the Commission has “repeatedly held that ignorance of the
securities laws is not a defense to liability thereunder”). By not participating in this proceeding,
Respondents forfeited an opportunity to show they have made efforts to remedy their past
violations and to offer assurances against further violations.
On these facts, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke the
registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
I ORDER that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrations of each class of registered securities of Shearson Financial Network, Inc., Shelby
Acquisition I, Inc. (n/k/a/ Phoenix Capital Source, Inc.), Shelby Acquisition II, Inc., Shelby
Acquisition III, Inc., Shelby Acquisition IV, Inc., US WATS Inc., Western Hemisphere
Investments Corporation, and Whirlwind Marketing, Inc., are REVOKED.

This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, I FURTHER
ORDER that a party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twelve days after
service of the initial decision. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(b). A party may also file a motion to
correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule of Practice
111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party,
then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the
undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of
finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review
or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative
to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall
not become final as to that party.
In addition, a respondent has the right to file a motion to set aside a default within a
reasonable time, stating the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specifying the nature
of the proposed defense. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). The Commission can set aside a default at any
time for good cause. Id.
