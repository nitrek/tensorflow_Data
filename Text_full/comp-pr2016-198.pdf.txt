COMPLAINT
16 Civ. _____ (__)
ECF CASE

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), for its Complaint against
defendants Nino Coppero del Valle (“Coppero”), Julio Antonio Castro Roca (“Castro”), and
Ricardo Carrion (“Carrion”) (collectively, “Defendants”), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
1.

In early 2014, Coppero tipped Castro and Carrion to inside information from

Coppero’s employer about its imminent acquisition of another company. All three Defendants then
profitably traded on the inside information.

Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 2 of 16

2.

From at least 2011 through August 2014, HudBay Minerals, Inc. (“HudBay”), a

Canadian mining company, employed Coppero. Coppero worked on a business team responsible for
HudBay’s Peruvian mine operations.
3.

By at least mid-January 2014, Coppero had learned through his job that HudBay

would acquire Augusta Resource Corporation (“Augusta”): material, non-public information, as
Coppero knew. At the time, Augusta’s shares were listed on the NYSE MKT exchange.
4.

In late January 2014, Coppero told Castro — a close friend and also a Peruvian

lawyer — that HudBay’s acquisition of Augusta was imminent.
5.

Coppero next told Carrion — a business acquaintance who worked at a Peruvian

brokerage firm (the “Brokerage Firm”) — about HudBay’s pending Augusta acquisition.
6.

At Castro’s suggestion, Coppero later purchased Augusta shares with Castro in a

brokerage account (the “Account”) held in the name of La Encantada, a British Virgin Islands entity
Castro controlled.
7.

Starting on January 30, 2014, and continuing over approximately the next week,

Castro used the Account to sell 2,100 HudBay shares — held since 2012 — and to purchase 104,200
Augusta shares for approximately $200,000.
8.

Funding approximately half the Augusta share purchases, Coppero transferred

$100,000 directly to the Account in La Encantada’s name.
9.

Between February 5 and 7, 2014, Carrion’s Brokerage Firm similarly purchased

77,800 Augusta shares for over $154,000.
10.

On Sunday, February 9, 2014, HudBay issued a press release announcing its tender

offer to acquire all of Augusta’s shares at approximately $2.96 per share — approximately 30%
higher than Augusta’s closing share price on the preceding Friday.

2


Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 3 of 16

11.

In the four trading days after the announcement, Castro sold most of the Account’s

Augusta shares. He sold the rest within two weeks of the announcement. The Account profited by
over $112,000 from the Augusta trades.
12.

In the first trading day after the announcement, Carrion’s Brokerage Firm liquidated

its entire Augusta position for over $73,000 in profits.
13.

Over the next several months, Castro first transferred $100,000 — the amount

Coppero had originally transferred to the Account to fund approximately half of its Augusta share
purchases — to Coppero’s bank account. Castro later transferred $50,000 — almost exactly half the
Account’s profits on the Augusta trades — to a bank account held by certain of Coppero’s close
relatives (the “Relatives’ Bank Account”).
14.

In the months afterward, Coppero and Castro tried to cover up their insider trading

in part by pretending that the Account’s $100,000 transfer to Coppero represented the return of
principal on a loan.
VIOLATIONS
15.

By virtue of the conduct alleged here, Coppero and Castro engaged in insider trading

in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)],
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)], and
Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], and Coppero, Castro, and Carrion engaged in insider
trading in violation of Exchange Act Section 14(e) [15 U.S.C. § 78n(e)] and Rule 14e-3 thereunder
[17 C.F.R. § 240.14e-3]. Unless Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, they will again
engage in the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this Complaint and in acts,
practices, and courses of business of similar type and object.

Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 6 of 16

HudBay Plans a Tender Offer for Augusta’s Shares
27.

By at least March 2010, HudBay and Augusta began discussing the possibility of

HudBay’s acquisition of Augusta. Although these negotiations did not lead to a business
combination, HudBay began purchasing Augusta shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
28.

In March 2013, the two entities resumed deal discussions. HudBay increased its

ownership in Augusta to 16% of Augusta’s total shares outstanding.
29.

In August 2013, HudBay engaged investment bankers to advise it on a potential

acquisition of Augusta.
30.

From then until December 12, 2013, Augusta and HudBay management

communicated many times about the acquisition.
31.

Between August 2013 and December 2013, HudBay’s financial advisers conducted

valuation work and analyses on the potential Augusta acquisition.
32.

Although Augusta and HudBay did not meet after December 12, 2013, to discuss a

potential deal, HudBay and its advisers continued to consider an acquisition of Augusta.
33.

On January 8, 2014, HudBay’s Board of Directors (the “HudBay Board”) received a

presentation from its advisers with updated due diligence on Augusta.
34.

On January 14, 2014, HudBay management informed the HudBay Board that

management remained interested in a potential transaction with Augusta.
35.

By January 30, 2014, HudBay had taken a substantial step or steps to commence a

tender offer for Augusta’s shares.
36.

On January 30, 2014, HudBay management again met with its investment bankers

and legal advisers to consider strategic alternatives involving Augusta. HudBay and its advisers began
preparing documents, including a presentation about Augusta’s valuation, for delivery to the
HudBay Board.

6


Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 7 of 16

37.

Between February 4 and 6, 2014, the HudBay Board members received these

documents.
38.

On February 7, 2014, the HudBay Board met to discuss the Augusta acquisition.

HudBay’s investment bankers advised the HudBay Board on the acquisition, and the HudBay Board
decided to convene later for a final determination.
39.

Until Sunday, February 9, 2014, when HudBay publicly announced its tender offer

for all of Augusta’s outstanding shares, HudBay’s acquisition of Augusta was highly confidential and
non-public.
Coppero Receives HudBay’s Restricted Lists and Insider Trading Policies
40.

On March 11, 2013, Coppero signed an acknowledgment that he had received

HudBay’s corporate confidentiality policy and insider trading policy. The insider trading policy,
written in Spanish, prohibited HudBay employees from trading in the securities of companies with
whom HudBay had a relationship while in possession of material, nonpublic information. It also
prohibited divulging such information to third parties.
41.

On May 13, 2013, a HudBay employee based in Toronto sent an e-mail to Coppero

and others attaching a “Restricted List.” The Restricted List named companies in whose securities
certain HudBay employees were prohibited from trading without the prior consent of HudBay’s legal
department.
42.

As the email made clear, the Restricted List limited Coppero’s trading.

43.

The Restricted List alphabetically named several dozen companies whose securities

Coppero and others were prohibited from trading. Augusta’s name appeared third on the list.
44.

On October 8, 2013, Coppero received a similar restricted list. It again named

Augusta.

7


Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 8 of 16

45.

On January 8, 2014, Coppero received an e-mail from the same HudBay employee in

Toronto. It attached certain HudBay company policies, including its insider trading policies. The
employee asked Coppero to circulate these policies to HudBay employees in Peru, to obtain
certifications from these employees that they agreed to abide by the policies, and to report back
regarding which employees had made the required certification.
Coppero Tips Castro and Carrion About the Acquisition
46.

Beginning in at least December 2013, Coppero learned of HudBay’s possible

acquisition of Augusta.
47.

By at least mid-January 2014, Coppero learned that HudBay’s acquisition of Augusta

would proceed.
48.

By January 2014, Coppero and Castro had been good friends for several years and

had also developed a close professional relationship. Castro knew that Coppero worked at HudBay.
49.

Because rumors had been circulating in Lima about HudBay’s potential acquisition

of Augusta, Castro had asked Coppero if he knew any details about the offer’s timing. Castro told
Coppero that they could profit from purchasing Augusta shares before the acquisition
announcement.
50.

In January 2014, after he learned about the forthcoming acquisition, Coppero told

Castro that HudBay’s acquisition of Augusta was imminent.
51.

Castro explained to Coppero how they could both profit from this information.

Castro explained that he had set up corporate entities, including La Encantada, that could not be
traced to him and that he could use to trade in securities before announcements of nonpublic
information.

8


Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 9 of 16

52.

Castro told Coppero that he intended to buy Augusta stock through the Account

and offered to do so on Coppero’s behalf. Castro suggested that they could explain any transfer of
funds from Coppero to La Encantada as a business loan.
53.

While considering whether to join Castro’s insider trading scheme, Coppero sought

advice from Carrion about opening a brokerage account to execute a trade that could not be traced
to Coppero.
54.

Carrion knew that Coppero worked at HudBay as an attorney.

55.

Carrion pressed Coppero for more information about the trade, and Coppero told

Carrion about HudBay’s imminent acquisition of Augusta.
56.

Coppero knew or recklessly disregarded that Carrion would trade on the

information.
Coppero, Castro, and Carrion Trade On Inside Information
57.

On January 30, 2014 — the day HudBay management met with advisers to begin

preparing documents for the Augusta acquisition — Castro sold 2,100 HudBay shares, which the
Account had held since 2012.
58.

That day, at 10:25 a.m. local time, Castro emailed Coppero with instructions for

transferring money to the Account. The instructions named La Encantada as the Account’s owner.
59.

About an hour later, beginning at approximately 11:30 a.m., the Account used the

proceeds from its HudBay sales and additional funds to purchase 35,000 Augusta shares.
60.

The next day, the Account purchased an additional 20,000 Augusta shares.

61.

The Account spent approximately $99,600 to purchase these 55,000 Augusta shares

on January 30 and 31, 2014, at prices ranging from $1.79 to $1.84 per share.

9


Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 10 of 16

62.

Less than a week later, on February 5, 2014, Coppero emailed a letter to his bank.

The letter instructed his bank to wire $100,000 to the Account and stated that the Account was
domiciled in the British Virgin Islands.
63.

The next day, Coppero received an e-mail confirming that his $100,000 wire had

been sent to the Account. He immediately forwarded the confirmation to Castro.
64.

That day, the Account purchased an additional 17,000 Augusta shares.

65.

The next day, February 7, 2014, the Account purchased 32,200 more Augusta shares.

66.

The Account spent approximately $99,900 to purchase these 49,200 Augusta shares

on February 6 and 7, 2014, at prices ranging from $1.89 to $2.15 per share.
67.

Also between February 5 and 7, 2014, an account at Carrion’s Brokerage Firm

purchased 77,800 Augusta shares in three separate transactions for a total price of approximately
$154,512. The shares ranged in price from $1.86 to $2.16 each.
68.

The Account’s sales of HudBay shares and the Account’s and the Brokerage Firm’s

purchases of Augusta shares, described above, cleared in the United States, and the transactions’
counterparties agreed to be irrevocably bound to sell the shares in the United States.
HudBay Announces Its Tender Offer
69.

On Friday, February 7, 2014, Augusta’s stock price closed at $2.28 per share.

HudBay’s stock price closed at $8.48 per share.
70.

On Sunday, February 9, 2014, HudBay’s Board met and conclusively decided to

make a tender offer to acquire Augusta’s shares.
71.

That day, at 6:02 p.m., HudBay issued a press release announcing that it would

commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Augusta. HudBay
priced its tender offer at approximately $2.96 per Augusta share.

10 


Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 11 of 16

72.

The next day, Monday, February 10, 2014, Augusta’s stock price closed at $2.95 —

approximately 30% higher than its closing price on the prior trading day. HudBay’s stock closed at
$7.96 — approximately 6% lower than its closing price on the prior trading day.
Coppero, Castro, and Carrion Profit from Their Insider Trading
73.

On February 10, 2014 at approximately 9:45 a.m. local time — the morning after

HudBay announced its tender offer — Castro e-mailed Coppero. Castro’s email contained no text:
just the word “Answer!!!!!” in the subject line.
74.

A few minutes later, Coppero responded: “Call me.”

75.

Later that day, Coppero and Castro talked by phone. The Account then sold 25,000

Augusta shares.
76.

The next day, the Account sold an additional 30,000 Augusta shares.

77.

A few days later, on February 13, 2014, the Account sold 32,600 more Augusta

78.

On February 24, 2014, the Account sold its remaining 16,600 Augusta shares.

79.

The Account’s Augusta sales ranged in price from $2.86 to $3.26 per share, as

shares.

Augusta’s share price continued to rise after HudBay’s tender offer announcement.
80.

In total, through the Account, La Encantada profited by approximately $112,000

from its purchases and sales of Augusta shares, and avoided losses of approximately $200 from its
sale of HudBay shares.
81.

Similarly, on February 10, 2014, the day after HudBay’s tender offer announcement,

the Brokerage Firm sold all 77,800 Augusta shares it had purchased in the preceding five days. The
Brokerage Firm’s Augusta sales ranged in price from $2.89 to $3.16 per share.
82.

The Brokerage Firm profited by approximately $73,212 — a profit of over 47% in

five days — from its Augusta trades.

Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 12 of 16

Coppero and Castro Try To Hide Their Insider Trading
83.

On February 24, 2014, one of HudBay’s in-house attorneys in Toronto forwarded a

request from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) to Coppero’s supervisor by
email.
84.

The request required Coppero’s supervisor “to identify people in [his] business unit

that were aware of [HudBay’s] interest in [Augusta] on or after January 1, 2013.”
85.

The in-house attorney’s email explained that he had already identified certain

individuals within the supervisor’s business unit who knew of HudBay’s interest in Augusta. The
attorney listed Coppero among those individuals.
86.

Later that day, Coppero’s supervisor forwarded the e-mail to Coppero. The supervisor

asked Coppero how best to determine who in Peru had advance knowledge of the acquisition. The
supervisor pointed out that Coppero’s own name should be first on the list of people who knew of the
acquisition.
87.

Coppero, replying to the same e-mail chain that already listed him as an employee with

knowledge of the acquisition, admitted: “I knew.”
88.

Approximately six weeks later, on April 14, 2014, the same HudBay attorney sent

Coppero a list of names of entities and individuals. The attorney asked Coppero to provide certain
information with respect to “any individuals or entities on [the attached] list” with whom Coppero
may have any type of personal or professional relationship. La Encantada’s name appeared on the
list.
89.

Over a week later, on April 22, 2014, Coppero claimed that he did not “know any of

the individuals or entities on the list.”
90.

The same day, Coppero signed an acknowledgment that he had received HudBay’s

insider trading policy.

12 


Case 1:16-cv-07591 Document 1 Filed 09/28/16 Page 13 of 16

91.

Over the next day or so, Castro and Coppero prepared documents purporting to

show a $100,000 loan from Coppero to La Encantada and backdated the documents to January and
February of 2014.
92.

Coppero and Castro also executed a document purporting to show that the loan had

been extinguished by April 2014, when La Encantada returned the $100,000 principal to Coppero
without any interest.
93.

On April 23, 2014, Castro signed a letter of authorization requesting that $100,000

be wired from the Account to Coppero’s bank account.
94.

Coppero’s banker then informed Coppero of the incoming wire and asked him what

the payment was for. Coppero claimed that it was for the repayment of a loan.
95.

In fact, the $100,000 wire constituted Castro’s repayment to Coppero of the

$100,000 Coppero had sent the Entity in February 2014 to pay for approximately half the Account’s
Augusta share purchases.
96.

Coppero later sought to transfer his half of the profits from the Account’s Augusta

trades to his Relatives’ Bank Account.
97.

On July 7, 2014, Castro signed a letter of authorization requesting that the Account

transfer an additional $50,000 to Coppero’s Relatives’ Bank Account. The Account did so.
98.

In October of 2014, Castro and Coppero spoke by phone. Castro reminded Coppero

that their story should always be that the transfer of money from Coppero to the Account
represented a loan. Castro reiterated that he would deny that Coppero had ever given him any
information about the tender offer.
