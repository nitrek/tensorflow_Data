which is required to file reports pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title shall—
(A) make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer;
(B) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that—
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization; and
(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences; and

annual accounting support fee or fees, determined in accordance with section 7219 of this title.

(5) No person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting
controls or knowingly falsify any book, record, or account described in paragraph (2).
(6) Where an issuer which has a class of securities registered pursuant to section 78l of this title or an issuer
which is required to file reports pursuant to section 78o(d) of this title holds 50 per centum or less of the voting
power with respect to a domestic or foreign firm, the provisions of paragraph (2) require only that the issuer
proceed in good faith to use its influence, to the extent reasonable under the issuer's circumstances, to cause
such domestic or foreign firm to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls consistent with
paragraph (2). Such circumstances include the relative degree of the issuer's ownership of the domestic or
foreign firm and the laws and practices governing the business operations of the country in which such firm is

located. An issuer which demonstrates good faith efforts to use such influence shall be conclusively presumed
to have complied with the requirements of paragraph (2).
(7) For the purpose of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the terms “reasonable assurances” and “reasonable
detail” mean such level of detail and degree of assurance as would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct of
their own affairs.
