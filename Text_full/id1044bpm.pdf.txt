SHREYANS DESAI

APPEARANCES:

Christina M. McGill and David Stoelting for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Shreyans Desai, pro se

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

In 2014, Respondent Shreyans Desai pled guilty in federal district court to two counts of
wire fraud; in 2015, the court, in a separate civil action, enjoined Desai from violating the
antifraud and broker registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Based on his
injunction and criminal conviction, this initial decision finds it is in the public interest to impose
permanent industry and penny stock bars against Desai pursuant to Section 15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On January 5, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Desai pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Section
203(f) of the Advisers Act. The OIP alleges that in November 2015, a final judgment was
entered against Desai in the civil action SEC v. Desai, No. 11-cv-5597 (D.N.J.), permanently
enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud and broker registration provisions of the
federal securities laws. OIP at 2. In addition, the OIP alleges that on May 5, 2014, Desai pled
guilty to two counts of wire fraud in United States v. Desai, No. 12-cr-330 (D.N.J.).1 Id. at 2-3.

1

The civil and criminal complaints were filed concurrently in September 2011. The civil action
was stayed pending completion of the parallel criminal action. Ex. D at 3. The same acts were
the basis for the both the civil and criminal actions. Id. at 4-5.

Desai was served with the OIP on January 11, 2016, and his answer was due by February
3, 2016. Shreyans Desai, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3603, 2016 SEC LEXIS 529, at *2
(ALJ Feb. 11, 2016). On February 3, 2016, Desai filed a petition requesting to postpone the
hearing for ninety to 180 days due to his lack of access to evidence, witnesses, and experts and
his purportedly pending appeal in his criminal proceeding, among other reasons. The Division
opposed Desai’s request for a postponement. I denied Desai’s petition and ordered a telephonic
prehearing conference for February 18, 2016. Id. at *2-4.
At the prehearing conference, I ruled that I would consider Desai’s February 3 petition as
his answer. Tr. 25. Desai requested an in-person hearing and additional time to retain legal
counsel. Tr. 14-16. I ordered Desai to make a filing by April 10, 2016, stating whether he had
obtained legal counsel and describing the evidence Desai would present at a hearing. Tr. 24;
Shreyans Desai, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3631, 2016 SEC LEXIS 648, at *3 (ALJ Feb.
22, 2016).
On March 30 and April 19, 2016, Desai made filings, but in neither one did he disclose if
he had retained an attorney or describe any material fact in dispute or any evidence he would
present at an in-person hearing. As a result, I granted the Division leave to file a motion for
summary disposition. Shreyans Desai, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3790, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 1424, at *5 (ALJ Apr. 19, 2016).
The Division filed its motion for summary disposition on May 6, 2016, attaching the
declaration of Christina M. McGill and fourteen exhibits (Exs. A-N).2 On May 27, 2016, Desai
requested an extension of time to file his opposition, which I granted. Shreyans Desai, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3888, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1949 (ALJ June 1, 2016). He filed his
opposition on June 22, 2016, attaching four exhibits (Desai Exs. A-D) and the Division filed its
reply on June 27, 2016.3

I admit into evidence the exhibits attached to these filings and take official notice of the
record in the underlying civil and criminal actions. 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.111(c), .323. I apply
preponderance of the evidence as the standard of proof. See Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 101-04
(1981). The findings and conclusions herein are based on the entire record. I have considered and
rejected all arguments and proposed findings and conclusions inconsistent with this initial decision.
II. SUMMARY DISPOSITION STANDARD
Summary disposition is appropriate here where there is no genuine issue with regard to
any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to summary disposition as a matter
of law. 17 C.F.R. § 201.250. Desai does not dispute that he has been enjoined from violating
the federal securities laws or that he pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud in the parallel
criminal case. Tr. 15; Exs. F, N. A motion for summary disposition is generally proper in
“follow-on” proceedings like this one, where the administrative proceeding is based on a
criminal conviction or a civil injunction. See, e.g., Gary M. Kornman, Exchange Act Release
No. 59403, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *40-41 (Feb. 13, 2009), pet. denied, 592 F.3d 173 (D.C.
Cir. 2010).
III. FINDINGS OF FACT
Court Actions
On May 5, 2014, Desai pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1343; and, in December 2014, the district court sentenced him to fifteen months imprisonment
followed by three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay restitution totaling
$121,260. Exs. L, N. The court of appeals, upon the government’s motion, summarily
dismissed Desai’s appeal of his criminal conviction, in view of the appellate waiver in his plea
agreement. United States v. Desai, No. 15-1105 (3d Cir. May 6, 2015).
In the civil action, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the
Commission. Ex. D. On November 30, 2015, the court entered a final judgment against Desai in
the civil action, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud and broker
registration provisions of the federal securities laws: Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 15(a) and
Rule 10b-5, Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a), and Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and 206(2).4
Ex. F at 1-4. Desai was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $167,229.39, plus prejudgment
interest of $40,520.99, and a civil penalty of $167,229.39. Id. at 4. Thereafter, the court denied
Desai’s motion for reconsideration, which he appealed. Ex. H; SEC v. Desai, No. 16-1629 (3d
Cir.). As of the date of this initial decision, that appeal remains pending.

4

In the civil action, Desai did not file a responsive statement of material facts to the
Commission’s statement of material facts; as a result, the court found “that there are no genuine
issues of material fact” because “Desai does not put forth any dispute of a material fact that
contradicts the evidence presented by the SEC.” Ex. D at 1 n.2, 6.
3

Desai’s Conduct
Desai was in his early twenties when he cofounded Shreysiddh Capital, LLC (SSC), a
New Jersey limited liability corporation, in 2008. Ex. D at 2; Ex. L at 3, 12-13. SSC was not
registered with the Commission or any other financial or regulatory agency, and Desai was not
licensed as a securities professional.5 Ex. D at 2, 7-8; Ex. L at 13. Between June 2009 and May
2010, Desai induced at least five investors to trade options, futures, and currencies though SSC.
Ex. D at 1-2; Ex. L at 13-14. These investors agreed to pay Desai half of all profits earned on
trades Desai executed on their behalf. Ex. D at 2; Ex. L at 13.
To induce these five investors to invest with him, Desai made various misrepresentations
including that: he was licensed to trade securities; SSC was a registered broker-dealer; funds
held by SSC were insured; and he had previously worked as a day trader for two years. Ex. D at
2; Ex. L at 14. Additionally, Desai promised at least one of his investors that he would keep
investor money in segregated accounts. Ex. D at 2. Desai received almost $250,000 from these
five investors, but did not deposit this entire amount into any brokerage accounts held by SSC.
Id. For example, one investor provided $100,000 to Desai, but only $90,000 was transferred to a
brokerage account; the remaining $10,000 was used for expenses unrelated to the investor’s
investment. Id. In another instance, three investors gave Desai $70,000, and Desai
misappropriated $5,000 to pay for various personal expenses. Id. From November 2008 to
February 2011, Desai spent over $141,000 of investor funds on expenses unrelated to their
investments, and he transferred a portion of these funds to foreign exchange market accounts. Id.
Desai covered up his activities by creating account statements showing extremely high
profits and informing investors that their SSC account values were higher than they actually
were. Ex. D at 2-3; Ex. L at 14-15. Additionally, he co-mingled investor funds, which on at
least one occasion he used to demonstrate purported increases in the value of investments. Ex. D
at 2. Desai deducted his fifty-percent commissions from the accounts based on the false profits
he reported. Id. at 2-3. For a brokerage account of a sixth individual, Desai inflated account
values and presented false account statements in order to receive $68,021 in commissions for
purported trades he undertook in the client’s brokerage account. Id. at 3.
Desai entered into a settlement agreement to pay $349,000 to one investor, of which
$60,000 was paid, and he returned $148,350 to other investors and entered into settlements with
most of them. Id. No investor received the large profits that Desai said he had made in their
accounts. Id.

5

On October 3, 2012, the district court entered a default judgment permanently enjoining SSC
from violations of the antifraud and broker registration provisions of the federal securities laws,
and finding SSC liable for disgorgement of $116,858.29 plus prejudgment interest. Ex. B at 1-4.

IV.

ARGUMENTS

Division
The Division maintains that the collateral bars authorized by Section 15(b) of the
Exchange Act and Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act are called for because the record
establishes that: Desai was associated with a broker-dealer or investment adviser during the time
of his misconduct; and he willfully violated provisions of the federal securities laws, was
criminally convicted for conduct arising out of his involvement in the securities industry, and
was enjoined from acting as a broker-dealer or investment adviser or from engaging in a practice
or activity in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. Div. Br. at 7-8. The Division
believes that the public interest favors barring Desai for a lifetime from participating in the
securities industry and from participating in penny stock offerings. Id. at 8-10.
Desai
Desai raises numerous arguments set out in nineteen separate points. Opp. at 1-4.
Primarily, he argues that this matter should be stayed until “all the matters are concluded” before
the U.S. Supreme Court and Third Circuit. Id. at 4; see id. at 1, 4. He asserts the following:
19) The heart of my Opposition is that it is not I, it is SEC being gutless for
violating my fundamental pre-requisite of Due Process. I reserve the right to start
a litigation in a Constitutional Court if Summary Disposition is granted.
Conclusion: Based on the above and based on the attached exhibits, it is that
prayer that Summary Disposition not be granted and that this matter be stayed
until all the matters are concluded at US Supreme Court and Third Circuit Court.
Id. at 4.
Desai also challenges the underlying district court proceedings and findings; however, the
doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes Desai from attacking his injunction and conviction in
this proceeding; the only means of challenging those district court actions is through an appeal to
the Third Circuit, which Desai is currently pursuing in the civil action. Opp. at 1-3; Tr. 14, 19,
22-23, 26; Daniel Imperato, 2015 WL 1389046, at *4 & nn.23-24 (Mar. 27, 2015), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 74886, 2015 WL 2088435 (May 6, 2015). Additionally,
Desai reiterates his position that his partner, Siddharth Patel, is also responsible and should be a
named respondent. Opp. at 1-4; see Tr. 12-13.
V. LEGAL CONCLUSIONS
I ruled at the prehearing conference on February 18, 2016, and in two written orders, that
a pending appeal of a federal court ruling is not grounds to stay an administrative proceeding.

If Desai is successful on his appeal, his remedy is to petition the Commission for
reconsideration of any sanction imposed in this proceeding. See Jesse C. Litvak, Exchange Act
Release No. 77993, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1998 (June 3, 2016); Charles Phillip Elliott, 1992 SEC
LEXIS 2334, at *11 n.17; Tr. 14-15.
Statutory Criteria
Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(A) and Advisers Act Section 203(f) empower the
Commission to bar a person from participating in the securities industry if: (1) the person was
associated with a broker or dealer or investment adviser at the time of his misconduct; (2) the
person was convicted, within ten years of the commencement of this proceeding, of a crime that
involved the purchase or sale of any security or arose out of the conduct of the business of a
broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or was enjoined from similar activities, or was convicted of
wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343; and (3) the sanction is in the public interest. 15 U.S.C.
§§ 78o(b)(4)(B)(i), (ii), (iv), (C), (6)(A)(ii), (iii), 80b-3(e)(2)(A), (B), (D), (4), (f). On the same
basis, the Exchange Act authorizes a penny stock bar. 15 U.S.C. §§ 78o(b)(6)(A).
Associational status: Here, the district court found that “[t]here is no question that Desai
acted as a broker by actively soliciting potential investors, possessing investor funds, and
receiving compensation for the transactions.” Ex. D at 8. The district court found further that
Desai’s guilty plea confirmed that he was acting as an investment adviser and that he agreed to
receive as a fee a percentage of all profits generated in his investors’ accounts. Id. at 7. It is
irrelevant that Desai was unregistered in any capacity. See Teicher v. SEC, 177 F.3d 1016, 101718 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (affirming Commission’s authority to bar persons from association with
investment advisers, whether registered or unregistered); Daniel Imperato, 2015 WL 1389046, at
*4 (noting Commission’s authority to sanction persons who act as unregistered brokers).
Conviction and injunction: The second statutory requirements are also met as to Desai
– the district court entered an amended criminal judgment on two counts of wire fraud based on
Desai’s guilty plea, and enjoined Desai from violating the antifraud and broker registration
provisions of the federal securities laws. Exs. F, N.
Public interest: The factors used to guide public interest determinations are: (1) the
egregiousness of the respondent’s actions, (2) the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction,
(3) the degree of scienter involved, (4) the sincerity of the respondent’s assurances against future
violations, (5) the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct, and (6) the
likelihood that the respondent’s occupation will present opportunities for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91
(1981). The Commission also considers the harm caused to investors and the deterrent effect of
sanctions. See Schield Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at
6

*35 & n.46 (Jan. 31, 2006); Marshall E. Melton, Advisers Act Release No. 2151, 2003 SEC
LEXIS 1767, at *4-5 (July 25, 2003). Each case should be reviewed “on its own facts” to
determine the respondent’s fitness to participate in the relevant industry capacities before
imposing a bar. See Ross Mandell, Exchange Act Release No. 71668, 2014 SEC LEXIS 849, at
*7-8 (Mar. 7, 2014) (citation omitted).
Desai’s misconduct was egregious and recurrent. Between June 2009 and May 2010, he
made numerous material misrepresentations to SSC investors, including representing that: he
had a securities brokerage license, he had worked as a day trader for two years, SSC was a
registered broker-dealer, he had accumulated significant profits on behalf of other investors, the
funds held by SSC were insured, and he represented to a least one investor that he would keep
investor funds in segregated accounts. Ex. D at 1-2, 7-8. Desai’s representations were false, and
as the district court noted, he deceived multiple investors over a period of approximately two
years. Id. at 7, 9. Desai’s misconduct was definitely recurrent. The district court in the criminal
proceeding found it “bothersome . . . that [the misconduct] went on for so long,” noting that
Desai knowingly misled people “because it went on for such a long time. It wasn’t one or two
incidents . . . . He repeatedly misled people that appeared to be unsophisticated and vulnerable
investors who trusted him” and concluded that his conduct was “repetitive and excessive.” Ex.
M at 27-28.
Moreover, to cover up his misappropriation of funds and market losses, Desai
compounded his initial fraud by co-mingling investor funds and creating and mailing to investors
false account statements that showed inflated values on which he charged commissions. Ex. D at
2-3.
Desai’s conduct was particularly egregious because he acted as an investment adviser and
thus violated the fiduciary duty he owed to his clients. E.g., SEC v. Capital Gains Research
Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 191, 194 (1963). The Commission considers fraudulent conduct to
be “especially serious and subject to the severest of sanctions.” E.g., Peter Siris, Exchange Act
Release No. 71068, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3924, at *23 (Dec. 12, 2013) (internal quotation marks
omitted), pet. denied, 773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir. 2014). The egregious nature of Desai’s conduct is
underscored by the $121,260 in criminal restitution, $167,229.39 in civil disgorgement plus
prejudgment interest, and $167,229.39 in civil penalties that he was ordered to pay. Ex. F at 4;
Ex. N at 6.
There is a great deal of evidence that shows Desai acted with a high degree of scienter, “a
mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680,
686 n.5 (1980) (citation omitted). He knowingly lied to investors to induce them to invest with
him, as well as continue their investments. Ex. D at 9. The injunction was issued because the
court found that Desai violated provisions of the securities statutes that require a showing of
scienter: Securities Act Section 17(a)(1), Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and
Advisers Act Section 206(1). See id. at 6-7. The district court found that Desai’s attempts to
conceal the actual value of the investors’ accounts “to mask his violations of federal securities
law demonstrates a high degree of scienter.” Id. at 9. It also found that “based on the evidence,
Desai acted with a high degree of scienter, as he repeatedly engaged in fraudulent conduct with
multiple investors.” Id. at 11.
7

None of the many filings Desai has made in this administrative proceeding acknowledge
wrongful conduct or offer assurance that he will not commit similar acts in the future. 6 At the
sentencing hearing on his plea agreement in the criminal case, Desai admitted that his actions
were done knowingly and willfully. Ex. L at 14-15. The judge in the criminal action, before
whom Desai appeared on two occasions, was not sure “that Mr. Desai is fully deterred from
future conduct without a custodial sentence,” found that Desai “appears to be somewhat
manipulative,” and did not “get a genuine sense of his full remorsefulness,” even though Desai
begged the court and investors for forgiveness and “promise[d] to be a better person and a
humble, responsible person.” Ex. M at 19-21, 28-29. The district court in the civil matter
similarly noted that “Desai’s appeal of his previously agreed upon guilty plea evidences a failure
to recognize the wrongfulness of his conduct, and leads the [c]ourt to conclude that there is a
substantial likelihood that Desai will engage in future violations of the federal securities laws if
not enjoined.” Ex. D at 9. There are no credible assurances in this record that Desai will not
commit future violations and no indication that he recognizes the wrongful nature of his conduct.
Although Desai’s current occupational status is unknown, absent a bar, he would not be
prevented from rejoining the securities industry and committing fraud again.
Each public interest factor supports imposing a permanent industry bar to “prevent
[Desai] from putting investors at further risk and serve as a deterrent to others from engaging in
similar misconduct.” Montford & Co., Advisers Act Release No. 3829, 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529,
at *86-87 (May 2, 2014), pet. denied, 793 F.3d 76 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see also, e.g., Guy P.
Riordan, Securities Act Release No. 9085, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4166, at *81 & n.107 (Dec. 11,
2009) (collecting cases), pet. denied, 627 F.3d 1230 (D.C. Cir. 2010); Gary M. Kornman, 2009
SEC LEXIS 367, at *23 (the securities industry “presents a great many opportunities for abuse”
and depends heavily “on the integrity of its participants” such that the Commission has “barred
individuals even [for] . . . dishonest conduct unrelated to securities transactions”). Where a
respondent has been enjoined from violating antifraud provisions of the securities laws, the
Commission “typically” imposes a permanent bar because “such injunctions have especially
serious implications for the public interest.” Toby G. Scammell, Advisers Act Release No. 3961,
2014 SEC LEXIS 4193, at *37 (Oct. 29, 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).
In addition, “absent ‘extraordinary mitigating circumstances,’ an individual who has been
convicted cannot be permitted to remain in the securities industry.” Frederick W. Wall,
Exchange Act Release No. 52467, 2005 SEC LEXIS 2380, at *14 (Sept. 19, 2005) (citation
omitted).

There are no mitigating circumstances present here. For all the reasons stated, the
statutory requirements have been met and it is in the public interest to bar Desai from
participation in the securities industry to the broadest extent possible.
VI. ORDER
Under Commission Rule of Practice 250(b), I GRANT the Division of Enforcement’s
motion for summary disposition and ORDER, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, that Shreyans
Desai is BARRED from association with an investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal
securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating
organization.
I FURTHER ORDER that, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, Shreyans Desai is BARRED from participating in an offering of penny stock, including
acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a
broker, dealer, or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or
attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Commission Rule of Practice 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of
the initial decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a
manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition
for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest
error of fact.
The initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of
finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review
or motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative
to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occurs, the initial decision shall
not become final as to that party.
