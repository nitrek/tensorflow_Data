III. Facts

6

A. Teo and the Trust that he controlled misrepresented Teo’s beneficial
ownership of the Trust’s shares.

6

1. As Teo and the Trust were acquiring less than 17.5% of Musicland’s
shares, Teo and the Trust disclosed that Teo was the beneficial owner
of these shares.

8

2. Teo paused buying Musicland shares after he and the Trust
approached combined holdings of 17.5%, because this was the
poison pill threshold that Teo saw as a cap on the number of shares
he could acquire.

9

3. On July 30, 1998, Teo publicly disclaimed beneficial ownership of
the Trust’s Musicland shares.

10

4. After July 30, 1998, Teo resumed purchasing Musicland shares in the
Trust’s and his other accounts, but neither Teo nor the Trust
accurately disclosed their holdings.
11
B. Teo and the Trust misrepresented Teo’s plans and proposals to change
Musicland’s board of directors.
i

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS (CONTINUED)

C. Teo and the Trust misrepresented Teo’s plans and proposals to take
Musicland private.

d. Teo testified that he received this document.

ii

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS (CONTINUED)
2. Even if exhibit PX103 were improperly admitted, the district court
acted within its discretion in denying a new trial.

31

a. Other abundant evidence establishes that Teo reviewed this
amendment before it was filed, and that Teo knew he was
disclaiming beneficial ownership.

31

b. The jury weighed the objections to this document.

33

c. Finding waiver was within the district court’s discretion.

34

B. The district court had discretion to admit Teo’s allocution.

35

1. Under Rule 404(b), the district court had discretion to admit Teo’s
allocution to show Teo’s intent.

35

2. The district court had discretion to admit Teo’s allocution under
Rule 609(a) as “evidence of a criminal conviction.”

43

3. The district court had discretion to admit details of the allocution
because Teo tried to explain away his conviction.

43

4. Any error in admitting the allocution was harmless.

45

C. Sufficient evidence supports the jury verdict that Teo and the Trust violated
Section 13(d).
45
1. The jury’s Section 13(d) verdict can be sustained based solely on
appellants’ undisputed misrepresentation of Teo’s beneficial
ownership.

iii

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS (CONTINUED)

2. A reasonable jury could also conclude that appellants misrepresented
Teo’s plans and proposals.
48
a. A reasonable jury could conclude that appellants misrepresented
proposals to change Musicland’s board of directors.

48

b. A reasonable jury could conclude that appellants misrepresented
proposals to take Musicland private.

49

c. The jury was instructed that Teo’s plans and proposals had to be
sufficiently definite before their disclosure was required.

51

II. The district court acted within its discretion in ordering disgorgement
and prejudgment interest.

53

A. The district court had discretion to require the appellants to disgorge
their profits from selling the shares they acquired after July 30, 1998.

53

1. The connection between appellants’ violations and profit is not
“speculative.”

55

2. The Best Buy tender offer was not an intervening event that severed
the connection between appellants’ violations and their
$17.4 million in profits.
59
B. Awarding prejudgment interest was within the district court’s
discretion.

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
_________________________________________________
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
ALFRED S. TEO, SR. AND MAAA TRUST,
Defendants-Appellants.
_________________________________________________
On Appeal from the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey
_________________________________________________
BRIEF OF THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
APPELLEE
_________________________________________________

COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES
This is an appeal in a civil law enforcement action brought by the Securities
and Exchange Commission for violations of the antifraud and shareholder reporting
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A jury found that defendants
Alfred Sunghia Teo, Sr. and the MAAA Trust (“the Trust”), the accounts of which
Teo controlled, made material misrepresentations in public filings concerning the
extent and purpose of Teo’s beneficial ownership of shares in Musicland Stores
Corporation, and that Teo did so fraudulently.

-1-

The issues in this appeal are:
1. Did the Commission engage in misconduct by introducing at trial a
document that the district court determined was authentic, where the jury weighed
Teo’s and the Trust’s belated objections to the document’s authenticity as well as
other evidence?
2. Did the district court abuse its discretion in admitting Teo’s allocution
testimony that he intentionally committed criminal securities fraud, as probative of
Teo’s intent to commit a contemporaneous civil fraud, and/or to rebut Teo’s
testimony that he had broken the law without intent?
3. Was there sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Teo
and the Trust violated shareholder reporting provisions where one of the three
factual bases for liability was undisputed, and evidence supported the other factual
bases for liability?
4. Did the district court abuse its discretion in ordering Teo and the Trust to
disgorge the profits they obtained from selling shares Teo acquired and beneficially
owned, where appellants materially misstated that Teo did not beneficially own
those shares and omitted the requisite disclosure of the extent of Teo’s beneficial
ownership? Also, did the district court abuse its discretion in ordering Teo and the
Trust to pay prejudgment interest on those ill-gotten gains?
-2-

STATEMENT OF RELATED CASES AND PROCEEDINGS
This case has not previously been before this Court. The only related case,
United States v. Teo et al., Crim. No. 04-583 (D.N.J.) (“Crim.Dkt.”), was terminated
after Teo completed his sentence for criminal securities fraud. See Crim.Dkt.212.

COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE
I.

Nature of the Case
A jury found that both Teo and the Trust violated shareholder reporting

provisions of the Exchange Act, and that Teo violated the Exchange Act’s antifraud
provisions. JA1921-1922. 1 The district court enjoined Teo and the Trust from
committing further violations, ordered them jointly and severally liable for the
disgorgement of their illegally obtained profits plus prejudgment interest, and
imposed civil penalties. JA3-8.
II.

Statutory Framework
Section 13(d), 15 U.S.C. 78m(d), and Section 16(a), 15 U.S.C. 78p(a), are

shareholder reporting provisions that require a person, or persons acting as a group,
who “beneficially own” a substantial amount of securities issued by a
company—meaning they have the power to buy, sell, or vote those securities

1

“JA” refers to the Joint Appendix. “SA” refers to the Supplemental Appendix.
-3-

(17 C.F.R. 240.13d–3)—to disclose the extent of their beneficial ownership, plans or
proposals they have for the company, and material changes to either. These
“disclosure provisions are intended to protect investors, and to enable them to
receive the facts necessary for informed investment decisions.” Chromalloy Am.
Corp. v. Sun Chem. Corp., 611 F.2d 240, 248 (8th Cir. 1979). For example, the
Section 13(d) provisions “alert the marketplace to every large, rapid aggregation or
accumulation of securities, regardless of technique employed.” IBS Fin. Corp. v.
Seidman & Assocs., L.L.C., 136 F.3d 940, 945-46 (3d Cir. 1998).
Under Section 13(d), a person who beneficially owns more than 5% of a class
of a company’s equity securities must publicly file a disclosure statement disclosing
the “identity” of the shares’ beneficial owner and the “number of shares” he
beneficially owns. These disclosures are required by Rule 13d-1(a), 17 C.F.R.
240.13d-1(a), to be made on Schedule 13D, 17 C.F.R. 240.13d-101. A person who
beneficially owns more than 10% of a company is required under Section 16(a) to
make similar disclosures. See Form 3, 17 C.F.R. 249.103; Form 4, 17 C.F.R.
249.104.
Also, a person who beneficially own more than 5% must disclose “any plans
or proposals” that “relate to or would result in”: “any change in the present board of
directors,” “[a]n extraordinary corporate transaction” (Schedule 13D Item 4(b), (d)),
-4-

or “any other major change in its business or corporate structure” (Section
13(d)(1)(C), Schedule 13D Item 4(f)).
Any “material change” to prior disclosures must appear in an amended
disclosure statement. Section13(d)(2), infra at 52n.8. See, e.g., Rule 13d-2,
17 C.F.R. 240.13d-2(a) (each 1% increase in beneficial ownership is “deemed
‘material’”); Arnold S. Jacobs, The Williams Act - Tender Offers and Stock
Accumulations § 2:82 (Jan. 2012) (“[s]mall additions” to beneficial ownership
“also could be material when a reporting person crosses a threshold, such as buying
sufficient shares to activate a poison pill”).
“[T]he SEC need not prove scienter to establish a violation” of these
provisions. SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1978). But
a violation made with scienter may also violate the antifraud provisions of Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R.240.10b-5.
See SEC v. Bilzerian, 29 F.3d 689, 693-94 (D.C. Cir. 1994).

III.

Facts
A.

Teo and the Trust that he controlled misrepresented Teo’s
beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares.

Teo, a senior officer and member of the board of directors of several
companies (JA857-860), over a three-year period amassed millions of shares of the
publicly traded common stock of Musicland, a retailer that sold prerecorded music
(JA184:5-15). As Teo accumulated close to 17.5% of Musicland’s outstanding
shares in the 28 accounts he controlled (JA1790-1791, JA447:7-449:15), including
the Trust’s accounts (JA527:7-528:15), Teo and the Trust properly disclosed that
Teo was the beneficial owner of all these shares. But Teo believed that disclosing
additional purchases would trigger Musicland’s shareholder rights plan—known as
a “poison pill”—and dilute his holdings. So on July 30, 1998, Teo publicly
disclaimed his beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares, giving the false
appearance that the percentage of shares under his control had been reduced.
The public disclaimer was a ruse. Teo resumed making large acquisitions of
Musicland stock in the Trust’s accounts, which neither Teo nor the Trust disclosed.
Teo also resumed buying shares in his other accounts, but failed to disclose these

-6-

additional purchases. Teo’s publicly reported percentage of beneficial ownership
of Musicland’s total shares thus diverged from Teo’s actual beneficial ownership:
40%

(This chart is derived from spreadsheets at JA1667-1707 and SA12, and charts at
SA11 and JA1767.) Teo and the Trust always publicly reported that Teo
beneficially owned less than 17.5% of Musicland’s shares (the chart’s green line),
thereby avoiding the poison pill, even as Teo’s actual beneficial ownership
exceeded 35% (the red line).

1.

As Teo and the Trust were acquiring less than 17.5% of
Musicland’s shares, Teo and the Trust disclosed that Teo
was the beneficial owner of these shares.

Teo began amassing Musicland shares in September 1996 (JA1667),
believing they were “undervalued.” JA539:24-540:6, JA181:15-21. By
November 1997, Teo beneficially owned over 16% of Musicland’s common stock.
JA1105-1121. By July 30, 1998, Teo acquired 5.9 million Musicland shares at a
cost of over $25 million. JA1938. In their initial Schedule 13D (JA851-868), and
six successive amendments filed during this time (JA869-897, JA898-922,
JA980-1004, JA1025-1054, JA1055-1076, JA1105-1121), Teo and the Trust
properly disclosed that Teo was the beneficial owner of the Trust’s Musicland
shares: “Teo holds an authorization to trade securities on behalf of MAAA Trust and
may therefore direct the disposition of the shares of the issuer held by this Trust.”
JA863; see also JA953-956 (Form 3), JA1015-1024 (Form 4).
Teo testified that at the time he authorized these filings, he understood that he
had beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares. SA61:23-62:11, SA60:5-22.
Although Teo “arrived in the United States over forty years ago with $70 in his
pocket and unable to speak a word of English” (Br.6), Teo’s colleague testified that
Teo has since become a “very savvy businessman” who understands English and
legal documents. SA30:14-32:14.

2.

Teo paused buying Musicland shares after he and the Trust
approached combined holdings of 17.5%, because this was
the poison pill threshold that Teo saw as a cap on the
number of shares he could acquire.

The combined, disclosed purchases of Musicland shares by Teo and the Trust
leveled-off before they reached 17.5% (SA11, JA1673-1675), because Musicland
had a poison pill that triggered when any shareholder or shareholders acting as a
group announced that they had acquired more than that amount. JA793-850;
JA189:8-190:10. If Teo crossed the 17.5% threshold, Musicland had the option of
authorizing all other shareholders to buy additional shares at a discounted price,
diluting Teo’s holdings. JA793-850. If the poison pill was triggered, Musicland
had options other than dilution (id.), but Musicland adopted the poison pill “to act as
a deterrent” to exceeding the 17.5% threshold (JA191:21-192:18). As Teo
testified, he was repeatedly warned by his attorney, James McKeon, and by
Musicland, that the poison pill acted as a barrier to his acquiring more than 17.5% of
Musicland’s shares. See SA79:10-80:18, JA590:13-592:17 (Teo); JA385:5-386:23
(McKeon); JA947, JA1088-91, SA7-8 (“the [Rights] Agreement will be triggered if
you purchase any additional shares after your percentage has reached 17.5%”)
(Musicland). And in a letter Teo wrote in a failed attempt to get Musicland to raise
the threshold (JA296:11-297:15), Teo stated that he understood that when he was

-9-

“very close” to “the cap set by the ‘Poison Pill’” he was “unable to acquire”
additional stock. JA1436; see also JA717:11-23.2
3.

On July 30, 1998, Teo publicly disclaimed beneficial
ownership of the Trust’s Musicland shares.

In order to circumvent what he saw as a cap on his Musicland holdings, Teo
devised a scheme to publicly disclaim his beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares
to make it appear that he no longer beneficially owned them. As explained by
McKeon, “if the MAAA Trust shares were not included on the [Schedule] 13D, then
that would reduce the total holdings below the 17 and a half percent,” and Teo could
resume purchasing shares in the other accounts he controlled while avoiding the
poison pill. SA50:6-51:12, JA422:13-19, SA49:15-18; see also JA533:12-21 (Teo
admitting that the poison pill was “one of the consideration[s]” for his disclaimer).
To disclaim beneficial ownership, Teo first purportedly revoked his authority
to buy or sell any securities on behalf on the Trust. JA1153-1157. Then, on July
30, 1998, Teo authorized the filing of Amendment #7 to the Schedule 13D
(JA1280-1294), which stated that “Teo ceased to have investment powers with
respect to the Trust,” and thereby “disclaim[s] beneficial ownership of shares of the
Issuer held by the Trust.” JA1289. Teo and McKeon both testified that Teo
authorized and understood these documents. Infra at 32-33. Indeed, McKeon
2

All emphasis is added unless otherwise noted.
- 10 -

instructed Teo that, with regard to the Trust’s shares, Teo “couldn’t vote them, he
can’t buy them, he can’t sell them.” SA52:21-53:24, SA54:9-14.
4.

After July 30, 1998, Teo resumed purchasing Musicland
shares in the Trust’s and his other accounts, but neither
Teo nor the Trust accurately disclosed their holdings.

Despite his public disclaimer of beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares,
Teo admitted that he never stopped trading for the Trust. JA523:13-524:9,
JA527:7-528:15, JA536:10-13 (“I always buy and sell securities for the Trust.”).
Indeed, after July 30, 1998, Teo made millions of dollars of purchases in the Trust’s
accounts. The Trust’s holdings soared from under 2% of Musicland’s total shares
before July 30, 1998, to over 5% of Musicland’s total shares by January 1999, and
over 11% by April 2000. JA1730-1749. The Trust filed two Schedule 13Ds that
falsely reported that its trustee, Teo’s sister-in-law, had the sole power to buy and
sell these shares. JA1491, JA1488, JA1514. The Trust also failed to ever disclose
that it had obtained over 10% of Musicland’s outstanding stock. JA1792.
Aside from the Trust’s accounts, during this same period Teo resumed buying
shares in the other accounts he controlled. In September 1998, Teo filed an
amendment reporting that he beneficially owned 16.9% of Musicland (JA13051327), and in May 1999, he filed an amendment reporting 15.5% (JA1411-1433),
but, as he was aware, he failed to report that he also beneficially owned the Trust’s
- 11 -

Musicland holdings (SA78:16-22). Furthermore, after May 1999, Teo stopped
making filings altogether, even though Teo’s holdings in accounts he controlled
other than the Trust rose to over 18% by August 1999, over 19% by October 1999,
and over 22% by May 2000. JA1719-1724. Teo admitted that he knew that he
was obligated to file an amendment every time his ownership changed 1% or more.
JA586:21-587:23; SA76:22-77:5. 3
After July 30, 1998, neither Teo nor the Trust publicly reported the total
number of shares Teo beneficially owned through the Trust’s accounts that he
controlled plus Teo’s other accounts. Teo’s total beneficial ownership exceeded
17.5% after August 1998. JA1675, SA11. Insofar as investors knew, Teo’s
beneficial ownership remained unchanged from the 15.5% he publicly reported in
May 1999 (JA1411-1433)—below the poison pill threshold—but after July 1998,
Teo’s actual beneficial ownership reached over 35% (JA1675-1706).

3

Teo also misrepresented his beneficial ownership in communications with
Musicland. Teo sent Musicland both the revocation of his authority over the
Trust’s shares, and his public disclaimer of beneficial ownership. JA1280-1299.
Teo admitted that he “never told” Musicland that these documents were false.
JA535:18-24, SA56:11-67:6. Musicland’s CEO/Chairman testified that Teo told
him that “he did not have control” of the Trust’s shares. SA36:7-38:14;
SA34:11-19. See also SA1, SA2-6, SA29:3-17 (Musicland outside counsel
concluded that Teo had not exceeded 17.5% beneficial ownership); SA7-8
(Musicland letter to Teo requesting notification if he exceeded 17.5%).
- 12 -

B.

Teo and the Trust misrepresented Teo’s plans and proposals to
change Musicland’s board of directors.

Teo’s and the Trust’s public filings repeatedly stated that they “have no plans
or proposals which relate to or would result in any change in the present board of
directors,” and these disclosures were never amended. JA861, JA1314, JA1420.
However, Teo testified that “I have asked to be placed on Musicland’s board since
the beginning of 2000,” and “I continue to ask every month.” JA641:11-642:14,
JA621:1-16. In December 1998, Teo wrote to Musicland proposing that he be
given a position on Musicland’s board. JA1328. When the board did not invite
him to become a member, he again proposed being added to the board in spring
2000. JA303:10-305:13. And in September 2000, Teo called Musicland’s
CEO/Chairman and said that “he wants a board seat.” JA720:13-22; JA771.
Indeed, Teo testified that he had a “slate of directors for nomination” to the
board. JA718:14-719:2, JA769. On February 3, 2000, Teo wrote the
CEO/Chairman a letter attaching the résumés of Robert H. Smith and Larry Rosen,
proposing that Musicland “add these two fine gentlemen to your board of directors.”
JA1476-1483. On February 7, 2000, Teo proposed the same for John Tugwell.
JA1484-1485. The board ultimately did not invite them to become members, in
part because “they would be there representing [Teo’s] interests,” and directors were

- 13 -

expected “to represent the best interests of each and every shareholder.”
JA304:4-9.
C.

Teo and the Trust misrepresented Teo’s plans and proposals to
take Musicland private.

Teo and the Trust repeatedly stated in public filings that they had “no plans or
proposals which relate to or would result in” an “extraordinary corporate
transaction,” or “any other material change in the issuer’s business or corporate
structure”; and these disclosures were never amended. E.g., JA861-62; JA1314,
JA1420. However, Teo repeatedly proposed taking Musicland private through a
leveraged buy-out of its outstanding publicly traded shares. As Teo testified,
“I tried to convince them to take the company private for two years.” JA594:8595:14. Teo believed that a going-private transaction would permit him to “cash
out” his Musicland shares at a substantial “30 percent or 40 percent premium,” and
margin calls on his investments had made him “beyond desperate” to liquidate his
Musicland holdings. SA63:20-65:23.
Teo fashioned proposals to take Musicland private with three different
investment banks. In January 2000, Goldsmith-Agio-Helms “provid[ed] him a
proposal” to “take Musicland private” at a “57% premium” over the existing stock
price. JA1434, JA1437-1471. Teo presented this proposal to Musicland’s
CEO/Chairman. JA596:7-597:11.
- 14 -

When Musicland did not accept this proposal, Trivest Capital in February
2000 proposed “Project Tune,” a “management led buyout” of Musicland at a
premium, with Teo on the resulting board of directors. JA1496-1498,
JA1499-1508. Teo signed a term sheet for this proposal (JA1496-1498), and in
March 2000 he presented it to Musicland’s CEO/Chairman (JA609:9-23).
Although Musicland did not accept this iteration, Teo still persisted with his plans
and proposals.
In September 2000, Teo obtained from Financo another going-private
proposal (JA1612-1653) as part of Teo’s “efforts to effect an advantageous sale of
Musicland” at a premium (SA9-10). Teo scheduled a meeting to present this
proposal to Musicland’s CEO/Chairman, who agreed to attend. JA614:1-615:6.
Even after Musicland’s CEO/Chairman cancelled his attendance the day before the
meeting (id.), Teo attended the meeting with Financo to discuss the proposal
(JA611:21-614:8). Teo suspended the meeting when he was informed by
Musicland that they were in negotiations to sell the company to a third party
(JA614:1-616:22), which turned out to be Best Buy Company, Inc. Teo
subsequently retained Financo to represent his interests if Best Buy’s tender offer
did not succeed, to “seek other alternatives for the maximization of the value of
[Teo’s] shares,” including “the sale of the Company.” JA1655.
- 15 -

D.

When Teo and the Trust sold the shares they had acquired after
July 30, 1998, they realized $17.4 million in profits.

When Teo and the Trust sold all of the 6.7 million shares acquired after July
30, 1998, they obtained over $17.4 million in profits. JA4; JA1938; JA1706-1707.
They sold over 1.2 million of these shares in the market, and sold over 5.5 million of
these shares to Best Buy as part of Best Buy’s December 2000-January 2001 tender
offer for Musicland. JA1938.
IV.

Proceedings Below
The Commission’s complaint charged Teo and the Trust with violating the

shareholder reporting provisions of Section 13(d) and Section 16(a), and Rule
12b-20, 17 C.F.R. 240.12b-20, Rule 13d-1, Rule 13d-2, and Rule 16a-3, 17 C.F.R.
240.16a-3. The complaint further alleged that Teo and the Trust violated the
antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by intentionally engaging in
conduct that violated the reporting provisions, and that Teo also violated these
antifraud provisions and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78n(e), and
Rule 14e-3, 17 C.F.R. 240.14e-3, by engaging in insider trading of Musicland’s and
C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.’s stock. JA1805-1844.
Before trial, the district court granted the Commission’s motion for summary
judgment against Teo on its Section 16(a) and Rule 12b-20 and Rule 16a-3 claims.

- 16 -

JA1883-84, JA1890. Appellants do not challenge this ruling. Also prior to the
trial, Teo settled the insider trading charges. SA119-128.
After a two-week trial, a jury found that Teo violated Section 10(b) and Rule
10b-5. JA1921-22. The jury also found that both defendants violated Section
13(d), and Rule 12b-20, Rule13d-1, and Rule 13d-2, and that the Trust violated
Section 16(a) and Rule 16a-3. Id.
After the trial, the district court denied Teo’s and the Trust’s motion for a new
trial and judgment as a matter of law. JA9-31. The district court enjoined Teo and
the Trust from future violations of the relevant securities law provisions, and held
Teo and the Trust jointly and severally liable for paying a $17.4 million civil
penalty. JA3-8. The district court also held Teo and the Trust jointly and severally
liable for the disgorgement of their illegally obtained profits of $17.4 million ($21
million in profits, minus $182,000 already disgorged as profits on Teo’s insider
trading, minus $3.5 million in margin interest on defendants’ trades), and $14.6
million in prejudgment interest on those profits. JA4. On appeal, Teo and the
Trust, although challenging the jury verdict, do not otherwise challenge the
injunction, the civil penalty, or the district court’s decision to hold Teo and the Trust
jointly and severally liable because of “the history of entanglement of transactions
and funds between the two.” JA21.
- 17 -

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
After a jury verdict finding that both Teo and the Trust made materially false
statements in publicly filed shareholder reports regarding Teo’s beneficial
ownership of the Trust’s Musicland shares, and that Teo’s misstatements were
fraudulent, the district court ordered disgorgement of their ill-gotten profits. All of
appellants’ challenges to the jury verdict and disgorgement order are without merit.
1. The Commission did not engage in misconduct by introducing a certain
fax as a trial exhibit. The Commission did not create this fax, alter it, or omit any of
its pages. Before it was shown to the jury, the district court heard appellants’
objections to the fax’s authenticity, but determined that it was prima facie authentic,
and that the jury would ultimately decide its authenticity. Teo then testified that he
received this fax. In any event, nothing turns on whether Teo received this
particular fax, which was introduced as evidence of Teo’s scienter, because
abundant other evidence establishes his scienter.
2. The district court acted within its discretion in admitting Teo’s allocution
to criminal securities fraud. Teo’s allocution testimony that he intentionally
committed a contemporaneous criminal securities fraud was probative here of his
intent to commit civil securities fraud. The allocution was also properly admitted to
refute Teo’s statement that he had never broken any law intentionally.
- 18 -

3. The district court did not err in determining that there was sufficient
evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Teo and the Trust violated
shareholder reporting provisions. Appellants do not dispute that they
misrepresented the extent of Teo’s beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares, and
the verdict can be sustained on that basis alone. Based on the record, a reasonable
jury could also conclude that appellants misrepresented Teo’s plans and proposals to
change Musicland’s board of directors and to take Musicland private.
4. The district court acted within its discretion in ordering Teo and the Trust
to disgorge the profits they made from selling the 6.7 million Musicland shares they
acquired after July 30, 1998, the start of their continuous and never corrected
material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the extent of their share
holdings. Disgorgement is not punitive, but rather restores appellants to the status
quo that existed prior to their violations. The $17.4 million in profits appellants
obtained from selling these shares is not a matter of speculation; it is the actual
amount of profit they obtained from selling these shares. That appellants sold 5.5
million of those shares to Best Buy in a tender offer does not sever the connection
between appellants’ violations and their profits because Teo acquired and
beneficially owned these shares after appellants falsely stated that Teo did not
beneficially own these shares and then omitted the requisite disclosure of the extent
- 19 -

of Teo’s beneficial ownership.

Furthermore, Teo expected to profit by selling

these shares in a corporate control transaction. Finally, awarding prejudgment
interest was within the district court’s discretion because it likewise restores
appellants to the status quo that existed before their violations.

STANDARD OF REVIEW
A jury verdict will be upheld where there was evidence upon which a
reasonable jury could find the defendant liable, even if it is possible that “conflicting
evidence” could lead to a different finding. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Videfreeze
Corp., 540 F.2d 1171, 1178 (3d Cir. 1976). The denial of a motion for a new trial is
reviewed for abuse of discretion, and granted only where the jury’s verdict was
“against the great weight of the evidence.” Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &
Co., 100 F.3d 1061, 1076 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc). A district court’s determination
to admit evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and reversed only where “no
reasonable person would adopt the district court’s view,” and the error was not
harmless. United States v. Green, 617 F.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir. 2010). This Court
reviews de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, but “must
expose the evidence to the strongest light favorable to the party against whom the
motion is made and give him the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference.”

- 20 -

Fireman’s Fund, 540 F.2d at 1178. Disgorgement is reviewed for abuse of
discretion. SEC v. Hughes Capital Corp., 124 F.3d 449, 455 (3d Cir. 1997).

ARGUMENT
I.

The district court acted within its discretion in denying appellants’
motion for a new trial and properly denied appellants’ motion for
judgment as a matter of law.
A.

There was no misconduct relating to the introduction of trial
exhibit PX103.

There is no merit to appellants’ charge that the Commission’s trial counsel
“knowingly used false evidence” by introducing trial exhibit PX103 (JA1254-1271)
as evidence supporting Teo’s knowledge that he had disclaimed beneficial
ownership of the Trust’s Musicland shares. Br.11-14, 43-51. This document
consists of (i) the fax cover sheet of a fax sent from McKeon to Teo regarding
proposed “Amendment #7 to Schedule 13D,” instructing Teo to “[p]lease review
and approve before I file this,” and (ii) the body of a fax, which is a draft of this
amendment containing handwritten revisions that disclaim Teo’s beneficial
ownership of the Trust’s Musicland shares. JA1254-71. Appellants contend
(Br.12-13, 44) that a new trial is warranted because, they claim, Commission
counsel knew that the body of the fax was not appended to the preceding fax cover
page.
- 21 -

Appellants fail to show that Commission counsel presented “known false
evidence.” Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 153-54 (1972); accord United
States ex rel. Dale v. Williams, 459 F.2d 763, 763-64 (3d Cir. 1972). Appellants
make no claim that Commission counsel fabricated or altered this document. They
point to an omitted page, but fail to tell this Court that they were responsible for this
omission. Moreover, Teo testified at trial that he received this document.
Appellants do not dispute that Teo received both the fax cover sheet (Br.12, JA1926)
and the typed version of the amendment that incorporated all of the handwritten
revisions indicated in the body of the fax (JA1280-94).
In any event, even if this document were improperly admitted, no new trial is
warranted because there is no “reasonable likelihood” that the document “affected
the judgment of the jury.” Giglio, 405 U.S. at 153-54; accord Dale, 459 F.2d at
763-66. Whether the cover sheet matches the body of this particular fax was not
determinative of Teo’s scienter because other abundant evidence showed that Teo
knew that he had disclaimed beneficial ownership of the Trust’s Musicland shares.
Also, the appellants’ contention that the cover sheet did not match the body of the
fax was fully aired before the jury. Finally, appellants waived their objections to
this document by never suggesting that the document was false prior to trial or
during the first six days of trial. See JA15-17, JA28-29.
- 22 -

1.

Appellants fail to show that Commission counsel presented
known false evidence.
a.

The Commission did not create or alter the document
that was introduced below as exhibit PX103.

The Commission did not generate this document. As part of Teo’s
prosecution for criminal securities fraud that occurred prior to this civil proceeding
(supra at 3), the U.S. Attorney’s office subpoenaed McKeon’s correspondence with
Teo, McKeon provided such correspondence to Teo’s criminal defense counsel, and
then Teo’s lawyers produced such correspondence to the U.S. Attorney’s office.
See Crim.Dkt.163 at 5&n.1 (letter brief from USAO, attaching PX103 at
Crim.Dkt.163-3 (SA221-238)); Crim.Dkt.170 at 2-3&n.1 (letter brief from Teo’s
counsel); Crim.Dkt.173 at 3&n.2 (letter brief from USAO). (These letter briefs
were made part of the record below. See SA140-176.)
Based on this production, in June 2006 the U.S. Attorney’s office
electronically filed in the criminal case a document that was identical to the one the
Commission introduced below as PX103. Compare SA221-238 (Crim.Dkt.163-3)
with JA1254-71 (PX103). The U.S. Attorney’s office described this document in
the same manner the Commission did at trial, as “a July 23, 1998 fax from McKeon
to Teo specifically indicating the key changes to be made to the upcoming
Amendment No. 7 to his Musicland Schedule 13D in which Teo’s beneficial
- 23 -

ownership of the MAAA Trust was to be disclaimed.” Crim.Dkt.163 at 5n.1
(SA144). At no point in the criminal proceeding did Teo challenge this
characterization, or the authenticity of the document.
The Commission obtained this document from the electronic docket in the
criminal proceedings and made it part of this case without any alteration. The
Commission explained where it had obtained the document, and attached the
document as part of an affidavit to its opposition to defendants’ motion to quash the
use of certain documents produced by McKeon, including this document. See
SA92-93 (attaching JA1254-71 (PX103) as a “Fax from James McKeon to Teo filed
on PACER as DE 163 by USAO”).
b.

Teo and the Trust omitted a page from the document.

Appellants note that the document submitted to the jury “omits” a page that
is Bates-stamped “DAT 42” (JA1929). Br.12-13. (The fax cover sheet is page
DAT 41, and the body of the fax spans pages DAT 43-59.) However, Teo’s
attorneys had possession of page DAT 42 throughout these proceedings, yet they did
not provide this page to the Commission until after the trial.
Appellants contend that this omitted page was the “most telling of all”
discrepancies with this document for two reasons. Br.12-13. They argue that this
page includes a note written by McKeon to his secretary instructing her to “type &
- 24 -

fax draft to Al Teo for his approval before filing” (JA1929)—but the body of the fax
includes handwritten notes that were not yet typed. In addition, they argue that the
note from McKeon to his secretary says “fax him Form 4” (JA1929)—but the body
of the fax does not include a Form 4. SA209, SA216:15-217:5 (in camera hearing
redacted in part after trial).
However, as noted, Teo’s attorneys—not the Commission—had possession
of page DAT 42 throughout these proceedings. Page DAT 42 was not included on
the electronic docket in the criminal proceedings, from which the Commission
obtained the document. See Crim.Dkt.163-3 (SA221-238). Appellants
successfully shielded this page from production during the civil proceedings below
based on the attorney-client privilege. Page DAT 42 remained in appellants’
possession, but they re-stamped it as “PJMCK0372” and listed it on their privilege
log. SA94-96, SA101-102. After conducting an in camera hearing outside the
presence of Commission counsel, Magistrate Judge Arleo accepted appellants’
assertion of the attorney-client privilege. See SA104-105 (redacted magistrate
opinion); SA209-220 (in camera hearing unredacted in part after trial); JA91-92
(magistrate opinion unredacted after trial). The Commission cannot be charged
with knowledge of a withheld page.

- 25 -

In addition to McKeon’s “most telling of all” note to his secretary regarding
the amendment, page DAT 42 also includes another note—written by McKeon’s
secretary—about electronically filing documents that has no bearing on the contents
of the fax. See JA1929, SA216:15-218:25; JA91-92. After the in camera hearing,
appellants produced to the Commission a page that had the “DAT 42” stamp
removed, omitted the “most telling of all” note that had been written by McKeon,
and included only the secretary’s irrelevant note. See SA215:25-219:15.
Later, on the seventh day of trial, appellants’ counsel challenged the PX103
document for the first time before District Judge Wigenton—who did not preside
over the in camera hearing about the privileged nature of page DAT 42—and
emphasized that “it’s even missing a page, as far as I can tell.” JA503:8-19. This
statement by appellants’ counsel to the court was disingenuous because they failed
to tell Judge Wigenton that appellants were the cause of that omission. Not until
after the trial did the Commission receive page DAT 42. The Commission did not
receive this page, and McKeon’s “most telling of all” note, until Teo and the Trust
attached the unredacted page, labeled “DAT 42,” to their motion for a new trial.
JA1927-1929.

c.

Before this document was introduced, the district
court determined that it was prima facie authentic.

Contrary to appellants’ repeated assertion that both the district court and the
Commission could not account for the authenticity of this document (Br.13, 27, 51),
before this document was introduced, the district court determined that it was prima
facie authentic. See Threadgill v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 928 F.2d 1366,
1375-76 (3d Cir. 1991) (prima facie showing of authenticity is made to the judge,
then the jury ultimately decides authenticity and weight of the evidence). At the
start of the trial, the district court found the document admissible as a statement by
Teo’s agent (McKeon), and determined with regard to this document that “there’s no
issue as to [its] authenticity.” SA22:23-27:12. Later, before the document was
introduced, the district court conducted what appellants agree was “an extensive
colloquy” regarding all of their objections to this document (Br.47), at the end of
which the district court reiterated that the document was prima facie authentic. See
JA33:1-39:24. The district court gave two independent bases for its determination.
First, the district court found the document prima facie authentic because it
was “received in response to a [criminal] subpoena, and obviously kept in the
ordinary course of [ ] Mr. McKeon’s business.” JA505:7-506:20. This circuit
agrees that the fact that a document is produced “pursuant to discovery requests” is a
“sufficient foundation for a jury to determine that this document is what it is
- 27 -

purported to be.” Lexington Ins. Co. v. W. Pennsylvania Hosp., 423 F.3d 318,
328-330 (3d Cir. 2005) (collecting cases). Specifically, the production of
documents to the government in a related proceeding supports the conclusion that
the documents “are what the government claims they are.” United States v. Reilly,
33 F.3d 1396, 1405 (3d Cir. 1994).
Second, the district court concluded that appellants waived their objections to
this document because “this is not the first time you [have] seen these documents,”
rather they “were produced for some time during the course of this litigation.”
JA506:13-24. Waiver is amply supported by appellants’ failure, despite
opportunities to do so over many years, to point out any purported inconsistencies in
the document until the seventh day of trial. 4
Appellants fail to grapple with either basis for the district court’s authenticity
determination. They challenge the court’s merits determination (that the document

4

Appellants did not question the integrity of this document when it was attached to
the Commission’s affidavit in support of its opposition to defendants’ motion to
quash the use of this document based on the attorney-client privilege (SA92-93, July
9, 2008); or in the final pretrial order which states that “unless set forth herein,
objections to authenticity are deemed waived” (SA132, SA135, January 18, 2011);
or when it was listed in proposed stipulations on admissibility (SA208, April 3,
2011); or at the hearing where appellants’ counsel stated with regard to this
document and others that, subject to privilege concerns, “we don’t take issue of the
fact that they’re admissible” (JA60:14-61:20, April 5, 2011); or when at the outset of
the trial the district court determined that “there’s no issue as to [its] authenticity”
(SA24:16-27:12, May 11, 2011).
- 28 -

was prima facie authentic) only by groundlessly asserting that this determination
was somehow “disavowed” when the district court’s denial of their motion for a new
trial emphasized waiver. Br.19, 48. Appellants challenge the district court’s
finding of waiver only by making the inconsistent assertion that the district court
could “not reverse course” once “the court itself had previously resolved” the
authenticity of the document “on the merits.” Br.47; see also Br.20, 27. Both
bases were sound exercises of the district court’s discretion, and this Court “can
affirm on any basis appearing in the record.” Curay-Cramer v. Ursuline Acad. of
Wilmington, 450 F.3d 130, 133 (3d Cir. 2006).
Whatever the basis for the district court’s authenticity determination, it is
absurd to maintain that the Commission knowingly presented a false document
where, prior to its introduction, the district court heard all of appellants’ objections
to the document, and then determined that the document was prima facie authentic.
See United States v. Mojica, 746 F.2d 242, 245 (5th Cir. 1984). The cases
appellants cite (Br.43-51) do not involve such a prior authenticity determination.
d.

Teo testified that he received this document.

Before the document was admitted, the district court invited appellants’
counsel to obtain testimony from Teo, such as “he never received” the document, or
he “do[es]n’t know what this pertains to and what it relates to, you can do that.”
- 29 -

JA505:19-22. Indeed, appellants’ counsel had vowed to “have Mr. Teo identify
with each document whether or not he received it.” SA25:8-20. The Commission
did not object to this course.
When the document was placed in front of Teo at trial, Teo did not testify that
he could not identify the document, or that he never received it, or that he had not
received the body of the fax. JA558:23-562:16. Rather, when Commission
counsel asked Teo if this document was sent to him, Teo replied “That’s what it say
is what it is, yeah.” JA558:23-562:16. And when asked if he had reviewed and
approved the body of the fax as requested in the fax cover sheet, Teo answered “I
don’t recall at this time” but “I must have, yes.” JA562:11-16. Teo’s testimony
independently established the document’s authenticity. See Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(1).
The cases appellants cite (Br.43-51) do not involve such authenticating testimony.
See, e.g., United States v. Weinstein, 762 F.2d 1522, 1534-35 (11th Cir. 1985) (“no
testimony or other evidence” linked a letter to an envelope). Notably, in their
subsequent examination of Teo, appellants’ counsel did not ask him any questions
about the authenticity of this document, or about Teo’s above testimony.
Appellants assert that “the SEC did not even attempt to lay a proper
foundation for the authenticity of PX103” (Br.44), but neglect to mention Teo’s
testimony. They also complain that McKeon did not testify about the document at
- 30 -

trial (Br.13, 44), but McKeon was unavailable to testify at trial because he asserted
the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (SA17:24-21:2). While
McKeon’s prior testimony from Teo’s criminal trial was read into the trial record,
during his civil deposition McKeon invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked any
question of substance (SA177-191), including with regard to Teo’s disclaiming of
beneficial ownership (SA185-186 at 32:4-33:7).
In any event, where a defendant’s sworn testimony confirms, and certainly
does not refute, that the document is what it says it is, it is preposterous to conclude
that the Commission knew that the document was false, or was barred from
submitting it to the jury.
2.

Even if exhibit PX103 were improperly admitted, the district
court acted within its discretion in denying a new trial.
a.

Other abundant evidence establishes that Teo
reviewed this amendment before it was filed, and that
Teo knew he was disclaiming beneficial ownership.

A new trial is not warranted where there is no reasonable likelihood that the
document affected the verdict. See Dale, 459 F.2d at 763-67. Even if the body of
this fax were inadmissible because it did not match the fax cover sheet, the body of
this fax “was merely corroborative, and not essential to the government’s case.”
Dale, 459 F.2d at 768, compare with Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154 (“the Government’s
case depended almost entirely” on the false evidence; “without it” there would have
- 31 -

been “no evidence to carry the case to the jury”). This document was only one of
many examples of evidence that Teo knew he had publicly disclaimed beneficial
ownership of the shares held by the Trust. Supra at 6-12. Indeed, appellants make
no challenge to the sufficiency of this evidence. Br.51-57.
For example, the revocation of Teo’s trading authority over the Trust’s shares
(JA1153-1157, supra at 10) is a document that Teo testified he “[m]ust have” seen
and he understood “[w]hen this document was filed,” which independently
establishes that Teo knew he was disclaiming beneficial ownership. SA67:18-72:8;
SA58:11-59:5. McKeon likewise testified that Teo told him to prepare the
revocation, and that he explained the revocation to Teo. SA39:9-46:6, JA420:10421:2, SA52:21-53:24, SA54:9-14.
More specifically, evidence other than the body of this fax demonstrates that
Teo reviewed this particular amendment before it was filed. The fax cover sheet
alone demonstrates that McKeon sent “Amendment #7” to Teo, instructing Teo to
“[p]lease review and approve before I file this.” JA1254. Appellants admit that
this fax cover sheet was sent to Teo. See Br.12; JA1926; see also SA73:7-9 (Teo
testifying that the fax number on the cover sheet is “my personal fax”). McKeon
also testified that “we decoupled Musicland”: “I prepared the 13D and then, you
know, Mr. Teo reviewed it.” JA389:9-25. And had the jury seen DAT 42, that
- 32 -

page would confirm that McKeon had his secretary “type & fax draft to Al Teo for
his approval before filing.” JA1929.
Indeed, it is beyond dispute that Teo received the typed version of this
document for Teo’s review and approval, and the typed version incorporated all of
the handwritten edits that appear in the challenged version of the document. See
JA1280-1294 (typed version, copying Teo at JA1281) compare with PX103
(JA1254-71, handwritten edits). When McKeon was asked if he had sent the typed
version of Amendment 7 “to Mr. Teo for his review before he filed it?” McKeon
answered, “Amendment 7, yes, I did.” JA403:19-404:4; see also SA47:24-48:24
(McKeon testified that “of course, yes” he advised Teo about filing Amendment 7,
and that Teo authorized him to make that filing). Teo also testified that he
“understood” at the time the typed version of this amendment was filed that he was
thereby disclaiming his beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares. SA85:4-86:18;
see also JA712:10-12.
b.

The jury weighed the objections to this document.

No new trial is warranted, even if this document were improperly admitted,
because Teo and the Trust availed themselves of the opportunity to argue to the jury,
as discussed in McQueeney v. Wilmington Trust Co., 779 F.2d 916, 930 (3d Cir.
1985), that “the documents are not genuine, or that they are somehow not worthy of
- 33 -

great weight in the jury’s deliberations.” See also Threadgill, 928 F.2d at 1376
(factfinder ultimately resolves issues regarding a document’s “completeness” and
genuineness). At the start of their closing argument, Teo and the Trust distributed a
copy of this document to each juror, asked them “to look at this document carefully,”
extensively outlined to the jury their contentions that this document was a “trick”
and lacked “integrity,” invited the jury “to be like a forensic document specialist like
you sometimes see on television,” and told them “you’re going to conclude pretty
easily that there’s something wrong with this document.” JA733:9-735:24.
c.

Finding waiver was within the district court’s
discretion.

In any event, the district court acted within its discretion in denying a new trial
based on its determination that appellants had waived their objections to this
document. See JA16, JA28-29. The district court supported this determination by
cataloging the numerous occasions prior to the trial when appellants could have
objected to this document, but failed to do so. See JA16; see also supra at 28n.4.

- 34 -

B.

The district court had discretion to admit Teo’s allocution.

In June 2006, Teo pleaded guilty to a criminal violation of Section 10(b) for
engaging in insider trading. In this civil action alleging another violation of Section
10(b), the district court admitted, under Rule 404(b) and Rule 609(a) of the Federal
Rules of Evidence, the judgment of conviction against Teo (JA1784-1788) and
Teo’s redacted allocution (JA1771-1783). See JA57:25-60:9, JA642:18-643:9.5
Below, appellants challenged the admission of both the judgment and the
allocution. SA137-139. Appellants now concede that admitting Teo’s judgment
of conviction was a proper exercise of the district court’s discretion. Br.32, 39.
But they contend that the district court was without discretion to admit Teo’s
allocution. Br.29-43. As discussed below, also admitting the allocution was
permissible.
1.

Under Rule 404(b), the district court had discretion to admit
Teo’s allocution to show Teo’s intent.

The district court acted within its discretion in concluding that Teo’s
allocution to intentionally committing criminal securities fraud was properly
admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). See JA58:25-60:9, JA498:3-499:1.

5

The allocution is admissible if it satisfies any grounds for admission, and is not
rendered inadmissible if it fails to satisfy another. See Paoletto v. Beech Aircraft
Corp., 464 F.2d 976, 982&n.16 (3d Cir. 1972).
- 35 -

Courts of appeals affirm the admission under Rule 404(b) of a defendant’s
allocution to similar acts. In United States v. Pettiford, 517 F.3d 584, 588-91 (D.C.
Cir. 2008), the court of appeals affirmed the admission under Rule 404(b) of the
defendant’s allocution to an intentional narcotics felony as evidence of his intent to
commit another narcotics felony. United States v. Kalish, 403 Fed.Appx. 541,
546-47 (2d Cir. 2010), concluded that the defendant’s allocution to mail fraud was
admissible under Rule 404(b) to show his intent to commit another mail fraud, and
explained that “[t]he broad discretion we afford trial judges on evidentiary rulings
makes what was a relatively close call at trial an easy affirmance on appeal.”
Here, the allocution was evidence of Teo’s similar acts that was (i) permitted
to show Teo’s intent; (ii) relevant to rebut Teo’s testimony that he never knowingly
violated the securities laws; (iii) probative of Teo’s intent beyond the probity of the
judgment of conviction to an extent that was not substantially outweighed by any
prejudicial effect exceeding any prejudicial effect of the judgment of conviction; and
(iv) accompanied by a limiting instruction that appellants did not contest below.
See Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 691-92 (1988); Green, 617 F.3d at
249-50.
Permitted use and relevance. The district court acted within its discretion in
concluding (JA58:25-60:9) that the allocution was admissible for the expressly
- 36 -

“permitted uses” of showing Teo’s “knowledge,” “intent,” and “absence of
mistake.” Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(2). A district court has discretion to admit evidence
that a defendant engaged in similar deceptive conduct because that “suggest[s]
intent,” and “tends to undermine defendant’s innocent explanation for his or her
act.” 2 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 404.22[1][a] (2d ed. 2012). This Court in
Saada held that “the evidence of [defendant]’s involvement in another fraud was
admissible because it showed his intent to defraud, knowledge of the fraudulent
nature of the water damage claim, and financial motive to commit insurance fraud.”
United States v. Saada, 212 F.3d 210, 223-24 (3d Cir. 2000); accord United States v.
Console, 13 F.3d 641, 659 (3d Cir. 1993); United States v. Kellogg, 510 F.3d 188,
197-202 (3d Cir. 2007); SEC v. Happ, 392 F.3d 12, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2004) (securities
fraud).
The district court here found the allocution was “clearly relevant”
(JA59:25-60:1) because Teo’s intent was a contested issue. Before the allocution
was introduced, Teo testified: “I would never file any *** incorrect 13D
knowingly.” SA74:14-18. He also testified: “I never intentionally break the law,
any law,” “[i]ncluding 13D law.” SA75:5-17. Appellants’ opening statement
asserted that there were mere “mistakes” in their filings that were not intended to
“trick or mislead anyone.” SA14:14-17, SA15:1-15. However, Teo’s
- 37 -

allocution—his prior sworn testimony (Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 64-65
(2004))—rebutted these assertions because in it Teo admitted that he acted
“willfully, knowingly, and with the intent to defraud.” JA1782:7-12. Teo also
allocuted to “know[ing]” that his “actions were in violation of the federal securities
laws.” JA1782:17-19.
Teo’s criminal insider trading and his misconduct here were similar. See
JA49:18-50:18; SA193-196; SA198-199. The allocution relates that in violation of
Teo’s duty to keep confidential the information Musicland provided to him
regarding Best Buy’s tender offer, Teo knowingly traded on the information.
Appellants recognize that the “connection” between Teo’s insider trading and his
misconduct here is that “they both implicated the securities laws and involved
Musicland.” Br.35. Moreover, Teo allocuted to intentionally violating his duty to
disclose his trading on material, nonpublic information or abstain from trading. See
JA1777:7-1778:17; United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 660-62 (1997). In
this case, Teo likewise intentionally violated his duty to disclose his trading that
materially changed his beneficial ownership.
Also, Teo’s insider trading in Musicland stock was contemporaneous with his
violations here, contrary to appellants’ assertion that it occurred “nearly three years”
afterward. Br.14-16, 33-35. Teo engaged in insider trading in Musicland stock
- 38 -

between September and December 2000 (JA1784-1788, JA1771-1783), and
appellants made false filings beginning in July 1998, which they never amended as
required, even after December 2000. Supra at 11-12. In any event, as appellants
concede (Br.33-34), this Court recently confirmed that “subsequent act evidence
may be properly admitted under Rule 404(b).” United States v. Bergrin, 682 F.3d
261, 281n.25 (3d Cir. 2012). 6
Probative value outweighed prejudice. The district court’s determination in
both its in limine ruling and trial ruling that “I don’t believe that the prejudicial effect
substantially outweighs the probative value” (JA59:25-60:9, see also JA499:17-21),
is afforded “great deference” (Bergrin, 682 F.3d at 279-80). Appellants criticize
the district court’s determination as “conclusory” (Br.36), but extensive briefing
apprised the district court regarding this balance. In any event, this Court can
“undertake to perform the balance” (Ansell v. Green Acres Contracting Co., Inc.,
347 F.3d 515, 525 (3d Cir. 2003)), especially because the balance has changed given
that appellants no longer challenge admission of the judgment of conviction.
With regard to prejudice, appellants suggest that the allocution “branded
[Teo] as a bad actor with a propensity to violate the securities laws” (Br.39), but the

6

Teo’s allocution to intentionally engaging in insider trading in C-Cube stock
(JA1771-1783) subsequent to his insider trading in Musicland stock (Br.14-15) was
also properly admitted.
- 39 -

judgment of conviction—whose admission they no longer contest—informed the
jury that Teo is a “convicted criminal” (Br.36-37). According to appellants, the
judgment of conviction includes a “description of the five counts of insider trading
(including the names of the companies at issue) and the details of his criminal
sentence: a 30-month prison term, a $1 million fine, and a two-year term of
supervised release” (Br.15). See JA1784-1788. As the court of appeals similarly
noted in United States v. Rodriguez, “any prejudicial effect” from additional
testimony about Rodriguez’s conviction was “minimal because the jury was already
aware of Rodriguez’s burglary conviction.” 43 F.3d 117, 125 (5th Cir. 1995); see
also United States v. Hearn, 549 F.3d 680, 683 (7th Cir. 2008).
There is no support for appellants’ assertion that the allocution created some
special, unfair prejudice. Br.37-38. In Pettiford, the court of appeals affirmed the
admission of an allocution over the defendant’s objection that it was “particularly
prejudicial.” 517 F.3d at 588-91; accord Kalish, 403 Fed.Appx. at 546-47. It is
unexceptional for this Court to affirm the admission under Rule 404(b) of a
defendant’s confession or admission to similar criminal activity. See, e.g.,
Bronshtein v. Horn, 404 F.3d 700, 703, 730-31 (3d Cir. 2005); United States v. Pitt,
193 F.3d 751, 762 (3d Cir. 1999). Furthermore, Teo’s insider trading was not a

- 40 -

violent crime, and evidence of a similar fraud is not “inflammatory.” United States
v. Johnson, 463 F.3d 803, 809 (8th Cir. 2006).
On the other side of the balance, the allocution is probative of Teo’s intent
beyond the probity of the judgment of conviction. As the appellants point out, only
the allocution contained admissions “addressing every element of Mr. Teo’s insider
trading offenses,” including that he acted “knowingly” and in “violation of a duty of
trust and confidence” to shareholders. Br.15. Accordingly, this is part of the
“chain of logical inferences” (Br.33) between Teo’s insider trading and his
misrepresentation of beneficial ownership. See Green, 617 F.3d at 247.
Limiting instruction. Before this evidence was introduced, and also before
their deliberations, jurors were instructed that they “may not use this evidence to
conclude that because Mr. Teo was convicted of insider trading, he must have also
committed the acts charged in this case,” or as “proof that Mr. Teo has a criminal
personality or bad character.” JA642:18-643:9, JA1798. “[A]ny risk of unfair
prejudice was minimized” by these instructions. Green, 617 F.3d at 252; accord
United States v. Givan, 320 F.3d 452, 462 (3d Cir. 2003). Appellants agreed to
these instructions, and cannot explain how the instructions, although minimizing
unfair prejudice flowing from the judgment of conviction, did not also do so for the
allocution.
- 41 -

*

The cases on which appellants primarily rely are inapposite. Br.32-39. In
United States v. Cook, 538 F.2d 1000 (3d Cir. 1976), the defendant’s sodomy
conviction obviously had no bearing on his trial for bank robbery. In United States
v. Morley, 199 F.3d 129, 130-34 (3d Cir. 1999), an uncharged forgery was
inadmissible to suggest intent because there was no evidence the defendant knew
about the forgery. In United States v. Sampson, 980 F.2d 883, 886-89&n.1 (3d Cir.
1992), the district court did not delineate which use under Rule 404(b) was
applicable, or conduct any Rule 403 balancing, and the prosecutor impugned the
defendant’s character by telling the jury he was the “type of man” to possess drugs.
In Becker v. ARCO Chem. Co., 207 F.3d 176 (3d Cir. 2000), the district court did not
perform any balancing before admitting an employer’s fabrication of customer
complaints about one employee to suggest its discriminatory intent to fire another.
In United States v. Murray, 103 F.3d 310, 317-18 (3d Cir. 1997), testimony about an
uncharged murder had no bearing on the defendant’s alleged involvement in a
continuing criminal enterprise. Finally, unlike the prosecutors in Murray, 103 F.3d
at 320, and Sampson, 980 F.2d at 886n.1, the Commission did not refer to Teo’s
allocution or conviction in its closing arguments.

- 42 -

2.

The district court had discretion to admit Teo’s allocution
under Rule 609(a) as “evidence of a criminal conviction.”

The district court also had discretion to admit Teo’s allocution under
Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(2) as “evidence of a criminal conviction.” JA57:25-58:24,
JA642:18-643:9. See United States v. Bogers, 635 F.2d 749, 749-51 (8th Cir. 1980)
(affirming admission under Rule 609(a) of defendant’s testimony concerning a prior
conviction); United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 187, 192-94 (1st Cir. 1994) (same).
Although they assert that the district court lacked discretion to admit under Rule 609
any “details” of the crime (Br.31-32), appellants concede that the judgment of
conviction’s detailed “description of the five counts of insider trading” (Br.15) was
properly admitted. See JA1784-88. Moreover, Bogers affirmed the admissibility
under Rule 609(a) of defendant’s testimony “delving into specific facts about the
underlying crime,” including “the fact that a shotgun was involved in the assault.”
635 F.2d at 749-51.
3.

The district court had discretion to admit details of the
allocution because Teo tried to explain away his conviction.

Because Teo attempted to “explain away” his prior conviction by giving his
own version of events, Teo “open[ed] the door” for the Commission “to inquire
extensively concerning some details of the prior conviction[].” United States v.

- 43 -

Amahia, 825 F.2d 177, 179-80 (8th Cir. 1987); see also United States v. Eaton, 808
F.2d 72, 75-76 (D.C. Cir. 1987).
During the Commission’s direct examination—and before the Commission
offered the allocution—Teo’s testimony included the statement: “I never
intentionally break the law, any law.” SA75:5-17. At the close of the
Commission’s direct examination, the district court permitted, with a cautionary
instruction, the introduction of the judgment of conviction and the allocution.
JA642:15-653:12.7
Teo then attempted to explain away his insider trading conviction during his
attorney’s questioning. Teo testified that he did not buy Musicland stock based on
inside information about a tender offer for Musicland. JA699:12-701:3. The
Commission told the court that Teo “seemed to be retracting part of his plea
allocution, or trying to get around it, and I’m going to have to cross him on that.”
SA83:17-20. The district court agreed (SA83:17-22), and appellants did not object.
When the Commission then re-examined Teo regarding his allocution, Teo
continued to maintain that he had not traded on inside information. JA722:4-728:4.
Teo contended that the details in his allocution supported his version of the facts.
7

Introducing the allocution at the “end of the SEC’s direct examination of Mr. Teo”
(Br.40) was proper (see United States v. Chrzanowski, 502 F.2d 573, 576 (3d Cir.
1974)), and Teo and the Trust never objected below to the timing of the allocution’s
introduction.
- 44 -

Referring to his allocution as his “plea,” Teo repeatedly invited the jury to “read the
plea carefully,” “read the plea yourself,” “read it, let the jury see them.”
JA723:1-724:4. Teo should not now be heard to complain that the jury saw this
evidence.
4.

Any error in admitting the allocution was harmless.

Any error in admitting the allocution was harmless given other overwhelming
evidence of Teo’s scienter. See supra at 6-15; United States v. Gricco, 277 F.3d
339, 353-54 (3d Cir. 2002). Appellants have it backward: if the plea allocution was
“needlessly cumulative” (Br.38), that would indicate that its admission, if erroneous,
was harmless. See United States v. Casoni, 950 F.2d 893, 915-18 (3d Cir. 1991);
Pettiford, 517 F.3d at 588-89. Appellants’ other arguments do no more than
recapitulate their erroneous contentions regarding prejudice. Br.39-43.
C.

Sufficient evidence supports the jury verdict that Teo and the
Trust violated Section 13(d).

The jury answered “Yes” when asked, did Teo and the Trust “violate Section
13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13d-1, Rule 13d-2,
and/or Rule 12b-20?” JA1921. Appellants do not dispute (see Br.51-57) that
there is a “sufficient evidentiary basis” (Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)) that they materially
misrepresented Teo’s beneficial ownership, and this Court can affirm on that basis
alone. In any event, a jury could find that appellants also made material
- 45 -

misrepresentations and omitted material facts about Teo’s proposals to change
Musicland’s board of directors and to take Musicland private. See JA24-27, JA29
(district court denying motion for judgment as a matter of law).
1.

The jury’s Section 13(d) verdict can be sustained based
solely on appellants’ undisputed misrepresentation of Teo’s
beneficial ownership.

Appellants do not dispute that a reasonable jury could conclude that they
violated Section 13(d) and the rules thereunder by making material
misrepresentations and omissions regarding Teo’s beneficial ownership of
Musicland shares. Appellants likewise did not dispute the sufficiency of this
evidence in the motion for a judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence
(SA87:10-89:9), or in their post-trial motion (SA201-207). Indeed, as described
supra at 6-12, the jury’s conclusion is supported by overwhelming evidence.
A judgment as a matter of law “must be denied if there is evidence reasonably
tending to support the recovery by plaintiff as to any of its theories of liability.”
Hofkin v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 365, 369 (3d Cir. 1996);
accord Tait v. Armor Elevator Co., 958 F.2d 563, 569 (3d Cir. 1992). Furthermore,
because the “weight of evidence and argument” supports this basis for the verdict,
the verdict should be upheld even if it were “factually impossible that liability could

- 46 -

appropriately be found” on another basis. Hurley v. Atl. City Police Dept., 174 F.3d
95, 120-22 (3d Cir. 1999).
Appellants cite cases (Br.57) where a verdict was set aside because one of
several bases was tainted by an erroneous legal standard that the jury was required to
accept. See Wilburn v. Maritrans GP Inc., 139 F.3d 350, 360-61 (3d Cir. 1998)
(one basis was not “legally sound”); Carden v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 850 F.2d
996, 1001-02 (3d Cir. 1988) (one basis was established by double hearsay). Such
cases are inapposite here because appellants challenge only the sufficiency of
evidence regarding the bases for the jury’s Section 13(d) verdict. Because the jury
is competent to find facts, this Court presumes that the jury decided on a factually
supported basis, and that any factually unsupported basis was “discounted” by the
jury such that “any error was harmless.” Hurley, 174 F.3d at 120-22; see also
Sandberg v. Va. Bankshares, Inc., 891 F.2d 1112, 1122 (4th Cir. 1989), rev’d on
other grounds, 501 U.S. 1083 (1991).
Appellants contend that a special verdict form should have been used (Br.57,
20n.3), but appellants agreed to the general verdict form after the Commission’s
complaint (JA1824-28) and summary judgment motion (SA107-108, SA113-118)
put them on notice of three bases for their liability. See SA129-130 (“Parties’
Proposed Verdict Form”); JA1892-93 (pretrial order). Accordingly, appellants not
- 47 -

only waived their special verdict request (see Ely v. Reading Co., 424 F.2d 758, 763
(3d Cir. 1970)), but also waived any argument about the purported indeterminacy of
the general verdict (see McCord v. Maguire, 873 F.2d 1271, 1274 (9th Cir. 1989),
amended, 885 F.2d 650 (9th Cir. 1989)). When the appellants attempted to “take
back [their] agreement” midway through the trial (JA636:15-637:9), the district
court exercised its broad discretion to use the previously agreed-upon general
verdict (JA627:9-25, JA729:10-731:12). See Kazan v. Wolinski, 721 F.2d 911, 915
(3d Cir. 1983).
2.

A reasonable jury could also conclude that appellants
misrepresented Teo’s plans and proposals.
a.

A reasonable jury could conclude that appellants
misrepresented proposals to change Musicland’s
board of directors.

The district court correctly concluded that there was “sufficient evidence” for
the jury to conclude that “Teo’s plans would have resulted in a change to the board
of directors, thus requiring that they be disclosed.” JA27. Without fail,
appellants’ public filings stated that they “have no plans or proposals which relate to
or would result in any change in the present board of directors.” JA861, JA1314,
JA1420. A reasonable jury could find that these statements were false because Teo
waged a two-year campaign to place himself, as well as three other persons
representing Teo’s interests, on Musicland’s board. As explained supra at 13-14,
- 48 -

Teo’s proposals to change the board were evidenced not by Teo’s “thoughts”
(Br.55-56), but by Teo’s letters and testimony, including his testimony that “I have
asked to be placed on Musicland’s board since the beginning of 2000,” and
“I continue to ask every month.” JA641:11-642:14.
There is no support for appellants’ position that Schedule 13D requires
disclosure only where there is (i) a formal proxy to nominate a candidate for the
board, and (ii) a vacancy on the board. Br.55-56, 22. Schedule 13D requires
disclosure of “any plans or proposals” which “relate to or would result in any change
in the present board of directors or management of the issuer, including”—but not
limited to—plans or proposals to “fill any existing vacancies on the board,” or to
nominate a director. 17 C.F.R. 240.13d-101, Item 4(d). Chevron Corp. v.
Pennzoil Co., 974 F.2d 1156, 1158, 1161 (9th Cir. 1992), held that Schedule 13D
“expressly require[s] the statement of purpose to include any plans for any change in
the Board of Directors.” Cf. Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Madison Fund, Inc., 547
F.Supp. 1383, 1386, 1390 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (reporting person properly disclosed
intent to seek representation on the board).
b.

A reasonable jury could conclude that appellants
misrepresented proposals to take Musicland private.

The district court correctly concluded that there was “sufficient evidence” for
the jury to conclude that “Teo’s plans and proposals regarding Musicland would
- 49 -

have resulted in an extraordinary corporate transaction requiring disclosure.”
JA26. Appellants were obligated to amend their disclosure regarding “any plans or
proposals” which “relate to or would result in [a]n extraordinary corporate
transaction” (17 C.F.R. 240.13d-101 Item 4(b), (f)), or “any other major change in
its business or corporate structure.” (15 U.S.C. 78m(d)(1)(C)). In their public
filings, appellants steadfastly stated that they had “no plans or proposals which relate
to or would result in” an “extraordinary corporate transaction,” or “any other
material change in the issuer’s business or corporate structure.” JA861-62, JA314,
JA1420.
A reasonable jury could find these statements false because, as Teo
acknowledged, “I tried to convince” Musicland’s management “to take the company
private for two years.” JA594:8-21. As explained supra at 14-15, Teo repeatedly
proposed taking Musicland private with three different investment banks. This
“unswerving” pursuit of a transaction indicates an “intention to achieve a plan.”
Otis Elevator Co. v. United Tech. Corp., 405 F.Supp. 960, 965-66 (S.D.N.Y. 1975),
compare with Susquehanna Corp. v. Pan Am. Sulphur Co., 423 F.2d 1075,
1084-1085 (5th Cir. 1970) (there may be no duty to disclose a plan that “subsisted
for a mere two days”). The proposals included a detailed term sheet that Teo
approved and signed (JA1497-98), GE Capital’s “buyout financing proposal” of
- 50 -

$300 million (JA1467-68), and detailed acquisition and price models (JA1499-1508,
JA1448-1465); such documentation supports a finding of a plan or proposal. See
Chromalloy, 611 F.2d at 246; Dan River, Inc. v. Unitex Ltd., 624 F.2d 1216, 1226
(4th Cir. 1980). Appellants’ brief (at 21-22, 53-56) does no more than point to
purportedly “conflicting evidence,” which is insufficient to overturn the jury’s
verdict. Fireman’s Fund, 540 F.2d at 1178.
c.

The jury was instructed that Teo’s plans and
proposals had to be sufficiently definite before their
disclosure was required.

Pointing to Azurite Corp. Ltd. v. Amster & Co., 52 F.3d 15, 18 (2d Cir. 1995),
as the standard for how definite a proposal must be before its disclosure is required,
appellants assert that Teo’s proposals were too “preliminary” and “tentative” to be
disclosed. Br.51-55, 20-22. However, the jury found appellants liable after being
instructed that “Section 13(d) does not require the disclosure of preliminary
considerations, exploratory work, or tentative plans or proposals.” JA1801-02.
This instruction was fashioned to track the standard articulated in Azurite (see
JA622:10-634:24, JA25-26), and appellants agreed to this instruction.
JA632:12-634:24 (appellants’ attorney stating that this instruction is “Beautiful”).

- 51 -

A reasonable jury could find that Teo’s proposals to change the board and his
proposals to take Musicland private were sufficiently definite and documented.8
Contrary to appellants’ contention (Br.56-57), it was proper for the jury and
the district court to analyze whether Teo had plans or proposals which “would result
in” an extraordinary corporate transaction or change in the board of directors
(JA1801, JA26-27), because that is the very language of Schedule 13D. 17 C.F.R.
240.13d-101 Item 4. Requiring disclosure of plans only after they are
accomplished, or proposals only after they are accepted, would defeat the purpose of
informing investors about “any plans or proposals,” and nullify those statutory
terms. 15 U.S.C. 78m(d). “[A] present inability to accomplish a plan is no
defense to concealing it.” Jacobs, The Williams Act - Tender Offers and Stock
8

While the jury found appellants liable under the standard articulated in Azurite, to
the extent Azurite requires a plan to be “fixed” (52 F.3d at 18), it overstates how
definite plans and proposals need be before their disclosure is required. The Eighth
and Fourth circuits are correct that an intended plan must be disclosed “even though
this intention has not taken shape as a fixed plan.” Chromalloy, 611 F.2d at 247;
Dan River, 624 F.2d at 1226n.9; see also Loss, Seligman and Paredes, The Williams
Act and Other Federal Securities Laws, Chapter 2.b.iii (2011). The proper standard
is that any “material” plan or proposal must be disclosed. United States v.
Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1298-99 (2d Cir. 1991) (applying TSC Indus., Inc. v.
Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976)); SEC v. Savoy, 587 F.2d at 1165-67
(D.C.) (same). But see Azurite, 52 F.3d at 18. Moreover, by statute and rule,
appellants were required to disclose “any material change” to their initial Schedule
13D disclosures (15 U.S.C. 78m(d)(2), 17 C.F.R. 240.13d-2, 17 C.F.R. 240.12b-20),
and “material” is defined as information “to which there is a substantial likelihood
that a reasonable investor would attach importance” (17 C.F.R. 240.12b-2, see also
Rule 12b-1, 17 C.F.R. 240.12b-1).
- 52 -

Accumulations § 2:47; see, e.g., Chromalloy, 611 F.2d at 243-46 (proper disclosure
of “unsuccessful attempt to gain representation” on the board); Elec. Specialty Co. v.
Int’l Controls Corp., 409 F.2d 937, 942-43 (2d Cir. 1969) (properly disclosing: “will
give consideration to a merger”).
II.

The district court acted within its discretion in ordering disgorgement
and prejudgment interest.
The district court acted within its discretion in ordering appellants to disgorge

the $17.4 million in profits they made from selling the Musicland shares that they
acquired after July 30, 1998, as well as the prejudgment interest on those profits.
See JA10-12, 17-22 (district court opinion); 3-4 (final judgment); JA1930-1938
(accountant’s declaration); SEC v. Hughes, 124 F.3d at 455. Disgorgement is not
“punitive,” as appellants claim. Br.28, 71. Rather, disgorgement deprives
appellants of their unjust enrichment and restores the status quo that existed before
their violations. See Zacharias v. SEC, 569 F.3d 458, 471 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (per
curiam).
A.

The district court had discretion to require the appellants to
disgorge their profits from selling the shares they acquired after
July 30, 1998.

Appellants concede that they “made substantial profits” (Br.11), and as they
correctly explain, the $17.4 million amount “represented the total profit that
Appellants earned on all shares of Musicland purchased subsequent to the first
- 53 -

disclosure violation in July 1998.” Br.23&n.4. After July 30, 1998, appellants
continuously made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding Teo’s
beneficial ownership which were never corrected. The red line in the following
chart illustrates the Musicland shares that Teo acquired and beneficially owned,
where appellants falsely stated that Teo did not beneficially own these shares and
failed to disclose the extent of Teo’s beneficial ownership and Teo’s proposals:

(This chart is derived from spreadsheets at JA1667-1707 and JA1938, except shares
purchased based on inside information were removed as per the final judgment, see
JA4 and JA1816-17 ¶¶56-57.) These are the shares that appellants sold for the
$17.4 million in profits. JA3-4, JA10-12, JA20.

- 54 -

The appellants also acquired millions of Musicland shares for which they
properly disclosed that Teo was the beneficial owner (the chart’s green line), and the
district court permitted appellants to keep any profits they obtained from selling
these shares, thereby properly “distinguish[ing] between legally and illegally
obtained profits.” SEC v. First City Fin. Corp., Ltd., 890 F.2d 1215, 1231 (D.C.
Cir. 1989). In addition, the district court reduced the disgorgement amount by the
margin interest appellants paid, and by the profits from their insider trading in
Musicland shares during this period that were disgorged before trial. JA4.
Appellants nonetheless contend that “the district court could not award even a
single dollar of disgorgement.” Br.61. But $0 is not a reasonable approximation
of appellants’ illegal profits. Rather, a reasonable approximation is the $17.4
million profit actually made by appellants. Contrary to appellants’ two main
arguments, the connection between appellants’ violations and such profits is not
“speculative” (Br.58-61), and they cannot escape disgorgement on the ground that
they sold most of the shares they acquired after July 30, 1998 to Best Buy as part of
a tender offer “unrelated” to their violations (Br.61-66).
1.

The connection between appellants’ violations and profit is
not “speculative.”

The district court found that the appellants’ profit on selling shares they
acquired after July 30, 1998 was a “reasonable approximation of profits causally
- 55 -

connected to the violation.” JA17-20, JA10-12. The profit appellants obtained
from selling these shares is not “speculative” (Br.58-61), as there is no dispute that
$17.4 million “represented the total profit that Appellants earned on all shares of
Musicland purchased subsequent to the first disclosure violation in July 1998.”
Br.23&n.4.
Disgorgement is not restricted “to the precise impact of the illegal trading on
the market price.” SEC v. First City, 890 F.2d at 1231-32. Rather, “the
government’s showing of appellants’ actual profits on the tainted transactions at
least presumptively satisfied [its] burden” to establish “a reasonable approximation
of profits causally connected to the violation.” Id. at 1231-32; accord SEC v.
Platforms Wireless Int’l Corp., 617 F.3d 1072, 1096 (9th Cir. 2010).9
Contrary to appellants’ contention, the district court never said that the nexus
between the violations and profits was “speculat[ive].” Br.6, brackets in brief,
purportedly quoting JA19; see also Br.60, 23. Rather, the district court
appropriately refused to speculate about what would have happened if appellants
had made proper disclosures: “This court cannot speculate as to how disclosure
would have affected the market for Musicland stock or the poison pill *** [or] as to
9

For example, where defendants purchase shares based on favorable, material
nonpublic information and later sell those shares at a higher price, the defendants are
required to disgorge all gains from the sales. E.g., SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42,
45-50 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Tome, 833 F.2d 1086, 1087-90, 1096 (2d Cir. 1987).
- 56 -

the effect the disclosure would have had on the prices of shares.” JA19. Likewise,
SEC v. First City affirmed disgorgement of all of the violators’ profits because their
“efforts to hypothesize” about disclosures that would have “complied with section
13(d) and the market reaction to that are impossibly speculative.” 890 F.2d at
1231-32.
Generally, any “risk of uncertainty” about the market effect of a hypothesized
proper disclosure is resolved against the “wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created
that uncertainty.” First City, 890 F.2d at 1232; accord Hughes, 124 F.3d at 455.
Here, appellants thwarted an analysis of the market effect of disclosure because they
never disclosed their true beneficial ownership or proposals, and Teo’s true
beneficial ownership and proposals were not revealed until after the violations were
complete and the Commission brought this action.
Appellants’ violations thereby contrast with those in the cases they cite
(Br.64-66):
● In SEC v. First City, the defendant filed a disclosure statement in a
Schedule 13D that accurately disclosed the extent of defendants’ beneficial
ownership, but filed it twelve days later than required. 890 F.2d at 1217-1221.

- 57 -

● In SEC v. Bilzerian, the defendant likewise accurately “disclosed his
accumulations” of stock, albeit belatedly. 29 F.3d at 692&n.3. Moreover,
Bilzerian violated Section 14, 15 U.S.C. 78n, by affirmatively misrepresenting the
funding for those purchases, which is a different type of violation than the ones here.
Id. at 692&n.4. And unlike appellants, Bilzerian “did not purchase any stock after
his alleged misrepresentations.” Id. at 696-97.
● In SEC v. UNIOIL, 951 F.2d 1304, 1307 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (per curiam), the
court did not require disgorgement of profits obtained “after the fraudulent nature of
the [representation] was discovered.”
● Similarly, the court in SEC v. MacDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 53-55 (1st Cir. 1983)
(en banc), did not require disgorgement of profits obtained “after the time when all
material facts became generally available.”
Finally, appellants’ reliance on Wellman v. Dickinson, 682 F.2d 355 (2d Cir.
1982), is misplaced. Br.58, 61-63. It may be that private plaintiffs seeking
damages must show that their “injury” was caused by a securities law violation.
Wellman, 682 F.2d at 368. But as the district court concluded (JA20), the Wellman
standard is inapplicable to the Commission’s enforcement actions for disgorgement.
“Unlike private litigants seeking damages,” the Commission is “not required to
prove” injury or loss causation, i.e., that “the misrepresentations caused any investor
- 58 -

to lose money.” SEC v. Blavin, 760 F.2d 706, 711 (6th Cir.1985); accord SEC v.
Pirate Investor LLC, 580 F.3d 233, 239n.10 (4th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unlike
private litigants, the SEC need not prove loss causation). Rather, in Commission
actions, “the purpose of disgorgement is not to compensate for losses but to deprive
the wrongdoer of his ill-gotten gain.” SEC v. Whittemore, 659 F.3d 1, 11n.2 (D.C.
Cir. 2011).
2.

The Best Buy tender offer was not an intervening event that
severed the connection between appellants’ violations and
their $17.4 million in profits.

Appellants assert that none of their profit from selling shares to Best Buy as
part of a tender offer can be disgorged because that tender offer was “unrelated” to
their violations. Br.61-66. As an initial matter, this ignores the profits appellants
made prior to Best Buy’s tender offer by selling in the open market over 1.2 million
of the Musicland shares they had acquired after July 30, 1998. Supra at 16,
JA1938. Appellants’ profits on these 1.2 million shares must be disgorged
irrespective of their arguments regarding Best Buy.
With regard to the 5.5 million shares they tendered to Best Buy (JA1938), the
district court properly rejected the contention that the Best Buy tender offer was an
“intervening event that broke any causal connection.” JA19. Appellants must
disgorge their profits on the shares they tendered to Best Buy—and indeed all the
- 59 -

shares they acquired after July 30, 1998—because Teo acquired and beneficially
owned these shares while appellants falsely told the market that Teo did not
beneficially own them, and failed to tell the market the true extent and purpose of
Teo’s beneficial ownership. See SEC v. Sierra Brokerage Servs., Inc., 608
F.Supp.2d 923, 969 (S.D. Ohio 2009) (awarding disgorgement of profits made
during Section 13(d) violations), appeal docketed, No. 10-3546 (6th Cir. April 30,
2010) (disgorgement not challenged on appeal).
Thus, it does not matter to whom appellants sold these shares, or the reason
why the resale price was higher, such as a boost from a tender offer, technological
advance, or a bull market. Similarly, “a person who fraudulently acquired a house
worth $100,000 in 2000 that appreciates to $200,000 by 2010 because of a strong
real estate market can’t complain when the rightful owner takes the benefit of the
$100,000 increase,” because “it is simple equity that a wrongdoer should disgorge
his fraudulent enrichment.” Mattel, Inc. v. MGA Entm’t, Inc., 616 F.3d 904, 910
(9th Cir. 2010). Consistent with this rationale, the district court’s order permits
appellants to keep the profits they obtained from selling the shares they acquired
before July 30, 1998, irrespective of when or to whom these shares were sold,
because appellants properly disclosed that Teo was the beneficial owner of these
shares. See JA1938; supra at 54 (chart’s green line).
- 60 -

Furthermore, as explained supra 6-12, Teo did not fail to make the required
Section 13(d) disclosures and deceptively conceal his true beneficial ownership for
no reason. Teo desired to amass and profit from Musicland shares, but he saw the
17.5% poison pill threshold as a cap on the number of Musicland shares he could
purchase.10 Teo fraudulently disclaimed beneficial ownership of the Trust’s shares
beginning on July 30, 1998 in order to conceal his total holdings while purchasing
shares above this threshold. Appellants engaged in this scheme based on their own
calculation that they could not obtain such profits on additional shares if they made
the disclosure required by the securities laws. Now that appellants’ scheme has
borne fruit, the district court had discretion to require disgorgement of the profits
made by appellants from selling the shares they acquired in Teo’s scheme.
Disgorgement of appellants’ profits on all their post-July 1998 acquisitions would
properly restore appellants to the status quo that existed before their violations,
where appellants’ pre-July 30, 1998 holdings amounted to less than 17.5% of
Musicland’s shares, and appellants believed that they could acquire no more.

10

And while Musicland may not have been “required” to activate the poison pill
(Br.9n.1), even if the poison pill threshold “does not work an immediate dilution,” it
“acts as an inhibition on alienation or additional purchases.” Hollinger Int’l, Inc. v.
Black, 844 A.2d 1022, 1088 (Del. Ch. 2004), aff’d, 872 A.2d 559 (Del. 2005); see
also Heil v. Morrison Knudsen Corp., 863 F.2d 546, 550-51 (7th Cir. 1988)
(describing poison pill as a “ceiling” on holdings).
- 61 -

In any event, to the extent it matters that the shares increased in value due to a
corporate control transaction, the district court correctly found that the Best Buy
tender offer constituted the kind of “market correction that Teo anticipated when he
bought what he considered to be undervalued shares.” JA20. Teo amassed
Musicland shares because he believed they were undervalued, and he expected to
profit from selling all of his shares at a premium in a corporate control transaction.
Supra at 8, 14-15. And in fact, that is exactly what happened here. It makes no
difference that the takeover premium was derived from Best Buy rather than from
going private, because the district court had discretion to require disgorgement of
Teo’s profits where the “purpose and effect of the scheme” was to obtain such
profits. SEC v. Lorin, 76 F.3d 458, 462 (2d Cir. 1996) (per curiam).
Moreover, appellants cannot maintain that the tender offer premium paid by
Best Buy was attributable to their efforts, and that they are entitled to keep it, given
their concession that “Teo played absolutely no role in bringing about the Best Buy
tender offer.” Br.65. Appellants assert that tendering their shares “help[ed]
ensure that the offer was consummated” (Br.62, 10), but Best Buy offered a 60%
takeover premium above the price of Musicland shares. Compare JA1663 (Best
Buy offered $12.55 per share) with SA110-111 (pre-tender price of $8.00). A 50%
premium is generally sufficient to induce a successful tender offer. See Litton
- 62 -

Indus., Inc. v. Lehman Bros., 967 F.2d 742, 749 (2d Cir. 1992). In any event,
wielding a block of shares one fraudulently says one does not beneficially own does
not constitute a legitimately compensable effort.
Finally, it makes no difference that the Best Buy tender offer occurred 2½
years after appellants’ violations began. Br.59, 65-66. Appellants must surrender
all of the accretion in value of these shares through the date that the true information
reaches the market and the violations are complete. Here, the true information
regarding Teo’s beneficial ownership and proposals was not revealed until after the
Best Buy tender offer was complete, given that appellants never made a proper
disclosure regarding their holdings.
B.

Awarding prejudgment interest was within the district court’s
discretion.

“The decision whether to grant prejudgment interest and the rate used” are
“matters confided to the district court’s broad discretion.” SEC v. First Jersey Sec.,
Inc., 101 F.3d 1450, 1476-77 (2d Cir. 1996); see also SEC v. Platforms, 617 F.3d at
1099-1100. Appellants’ challenges (Br.67-71) to the district court’s conclusion
(JA4, 21-22) that they are liable for $14.6 million in prejudgment interest on the
disgorgement award are without merit.
The district court had discretion to measure the prejudgment period from
when appellants received their ill-gotten gains by selling shares, rather than from the
- 63 -

filing of the complaint (Br.67-68), to prevent appellants from benefitting from the
time value inherent in the use of their ill-gotten gains. See First Jersey, 101 F.3d at
1461, 476-77 (over $50 million in prejudgment interest measured from “dates of the
gains through the entry of judgment—a period of up to 12+ years”).
Any delay in reaching the final judgment (Br.67) was the result of appellants’
self-concealing violations. And appellants did not oppose the stays of the case to
which they refer. Br.68. In any event, “[e]ven if defendants were correct that the
present litigation was protracted through some fault of the SEC, defendants plainly
had the use of their unlawful profits for the entire period.” First Jersey, 101 F.3d at
1477; accord SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 50 (2d Cir. 1998).
Finally, it was within the district court’s discretion to calculate interest
(Br.68-71) based on the underpayment rate used by the Internal Revenue
Service—which approximates the rate appellants would have to pay as
borrowers—rather than the Treasury bill rate—which reflects the rate for lending
money to the government. Platforms, 617 F.3d at 1099; First Jersey, 101 F.3d at
1476-77.
