SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

ASTRAZENECA PLC
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against AstraZeneca PLC (“AZN” or “Respondent”).

II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:

SUMMARY
These proceedings arise out of violations of the internal controls and recordkeeping
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) by AZN and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries in China and Russia. Through at least 2010, AZN failed to devise and maintain a
sufficient system of internal accounting controls relating to the interactions of its China and Russia
subsidiaries with government officials, the vast majority of whom were health care providers
(“HCPs”), at state-owned and state-controlled entities in China and Russia. Sales and marketing
staff, along with multiple levels of management at the two AZN subsidiaries, designed and
authorized several schemes to make improper payments of gifts, conference support, travel, cash
and other benefits to HCPs to reward or influence their purchases of AZN pharmaceuticals. In
addition, employees in the China subsidiary made cash payments to local officials to reduce or
avoid fines that were levied against the China subsidiary. AZN falsely recorded all of the improper
payments by its China and Russia subsidiaries as bona fide business expenses in its consolidated
financial statements.

FACTS
Improper Conduct at AZ China
5.
From 2007 until 2010, AZ China sales staff made numerous improper payments in
cash, gifts and other items to HCPs as incentives to purchase or prescribe AZN pharmaceuticals.
Sales and marketing team members, including managers within various business units at AZ
China, designed and implemented the improper payment schemes. The HCPs who received the
improper incentives worked for various government entities in several regions throughout China.
6.
Between at least 2006 and 2009, certain AZ China sales staff and their managers
maintained written charts and schedules that recorded the amount of forecasted or actual payments
of maintenance fees, gifts, entertainment and other expenses that AZ China would make per month
or year in numerous regions throughout China. In some cases, the payments referenced gifts,
entertainment and other expenses to individual physicians, and in other cases, maintenance fees to
a particular hospital or medical department, as designated by an individual physician. AZ China
sales staff management approved these payments with the expectation that the HCPs would
increase purchases of AZN products during the corresponding period, or favorably influence the
inclusion of AZN products on formulary or reimbursement drug listings.
7.
In numerous instances, AZ China sales staff submitted, and managerial employees
knowingly approved, fake fa piao (tax receipts) for fraudulent reimbursements to generate cash
that was used to make improper payments to HCPs.
8.
Other methods were also used, such as establishing bank accounts in doctors’
names as part of an improper payment scheme, or engaging a collusive travel vendor who
submitted fake or inflated invoices to generate cash that could be used to funnel money to HCPs.
9.
As a result of the deficient controls, AZ China employees were regularly
reimbursed for submitted expenses despite inadequate supporting documentation.
10.
Similarly, AZ China paid speaker fees to HCPs despite AZ China service contracts
that were incomplete, containing no meeting date, venue, subject or fees associated with the
particular speaker event. In some instances, the related speaker engagement was totally fabricated
and never occurred. Additionally, sales and marketing team members were able to bypass formal
approval procedures that required validation by a designated signatory in the company’s electronic
approval system.
11.
In addition, in connection with inquiries by local Chinese government officials in
2008, AZ China employees made payments in cash to the local officials to get reductions or
dismissals of proposed financial sanctions against the subsidiary.
3

Improper Conduct at AZ Russia
12.
From at least 2005 until 2010, AZ Russia employees provided improper incentives
to government-employed HCPs in connection with sales of AZN pharmaceutical products.
13.
As was done by AZ China employees, AZ Russia employees created and
maintained charts tracking the names of HCPs, the regions in which they practiced, their level of
influence in making purchasing decisions for the respective entities where they worked and the
manner in which they could be motivated to purchase AZN products through gifts, conference
support and other means.
14.
Employees at several levels of AZ Russia management directed or condoned their
subordinates’ practices of providing improper benefits to government-employed HCPs, which
occurred in multiple regions where AZ Russia operates.
COOPERATION AND REMEDIAL EFFORTS
15.
AZN did not self-report its violations; nevertheless, the company provided
significant cooperation to the Commission during the entire course of its investigation. AZN
immediately took a cooperative posture and ensured that it consistently provided complete
information in a timely manner. AZN voluntarily and timely disclosed information obtained
during its own internal investigation, provided translations of key documents, and disclosed facts
that the Commission would not have been able to readily and independently discover. AZN also
kept the staff regularly informed of its ongoing remedial efforts throughout the course of the
investigation.
16.
AZN had begun independently remediating deficiencies in its compliance program
prior to the Commission’s investigation. The company incorporated information developed in the
course of the Commission’s investigation to further enhance its controls and compliance program.
AZN made significant increases to both capital and human resources available to compliance at the
corporate level and in the local markets. It has developed a centralized compliance program,
revamped its internal controls and procedures, and placed key compliance personnel in high-risk
local markets. Among the other improvements made are enhancements to AZN’s policies
governing interactions with HCPs and government officials, gifts, travel and entertainment, thirdparty engagements, meetings, congresses, and contributions. AZN also enhanced its anticorruption training and audits. Additionally, AZN has taken various steps with regard to involved
employees, including targeted training, reassignment to lower-risk areas of responsibility,
voluntary separations, and dismissals.
LEGAL STANDARDS
17.
Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a ceaseand-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated or is about to violate any provision
of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder or any other person that is, was or would
4

be a cause of the violation due to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would
contribute to such violation.
Violations of the Books and Records and Internal Controls Provisions of the FCPA
18.
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, the books and records provision of the
FCPA, requires every issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act “to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.” 15 U.S.C.
§ 78m(b)(2)(A). As described above, AZN violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) when its subsidiaries
mischaracterized improper payments as legitimate expenses in AZN’s books and records.
19.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the internal controls provision of the
FCPA, requires every issuer with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act to “devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or
any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.” 15 U.S.C.
§ 78m(b)(2)(B).
20.
As described above, AZN violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by
failing to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls relating to
employee reimbursements, third-party vendors, speaker fees, conferences, gifts, travel and
entertainment. AZN did not adequately enforce its corporate policy against making improper
payments to government officials with respect to its subsidiaries in Russia and China. Although
the company had a written policy that prohibited these unauthorized transactions, AZN did not
employ reasonable controls to detect and prevent such improper payments. AZN failed to ensure
that its Russia and China subsidiaries maintained accurate and complete recording of financial
transactions referencing payments to government officials. These records never appropriately
described the transactions, and were always inaccurate or incomplete, when the purpose of the
payment involved an improper incentive to the government official. The company also did not
employ reasonable measures to ensure that sponsorship activities involving government officials in
China were appropriately approved through the company’s established electronic system by a predesignated official in the country. Additionally, AZN did not provide adequate FCPA training to
its sales and marketing employees in China and Russia who had routine interactions with
government officials in the healthcare industry that posed a high risk for bribery and corruption.
Furthermore, AZN did not employ reasonable due diligence and monitoring of third-party
contractors engaged by its China and Russia subsidiaries, such as travel vendors who provided
false invoices to the subsidiaries’ employees that facilitated the unauthorized use of corporate
funds to improperly incentivize HCPs.
5

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent AZN’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent AstraZeneca PLC cease
and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)].
B.
Respondent shall, within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Order, pay
disgorgement of $4,325,000, which represents profits gained as a result of the conduct described
herein, prejudgment interest of $822,000, and a civil money penalty of $375,000 to the Securities
and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to
Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest is
not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600, and if timely
payment of a civil money penalty is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31
U.S.C. § 3717. Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:
Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
AstraZeneca PLC as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings;
a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Charles E. Cain, Deputy Chief,
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-5648.

C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
D.
Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in
excess of $375,000 based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation and related
enforcement action. If at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement
(“Division”) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided materially false
or misleading information or materials to the Commission, or in a related proceeding, the Division
may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to the Respondent, petition the Commission to
reopen this matter and seek an order directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil money
penalty. Respondent may contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding
whether it knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1) contest
the findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy, including, but not limited
to, any statute of limitations defense.

By the Commission.
