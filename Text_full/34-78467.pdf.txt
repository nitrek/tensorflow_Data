In the Matter of
MICHAEL ANTONIO ZURITA

ORDER VACATING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING
ORGANIZATION AND MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BARS
Michael Antonio Zurita seeks to vacate an administrative bar order dated October 31,
2011 (the "bar order") to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally
recognized statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") and municipal advisor.1 The NRSRO and
municipal advisor bars imposed on Zurita were based solely on conduct occurring prior to July
22, 2010, the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act.2 Accordingly, in our discretion, we vacate the bar order to the extent that it prohibits
Michael Antonio Zurita from associating with any NRSRO and municipal advisor, but otherwise
leave the bar unchanged.
By the Commission.
