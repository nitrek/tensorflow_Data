In the Matter of

ORDER GRANTING
EXTENSION

PAUL LEON WHITE, II
On May 13, 2016, I set a motions schedule. Paul Leon White, II, Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3841, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1732. Under that schedule, the Division of Enforcement
was given until June 10, 2016, to file a motion for summary disposition and Respondent Paul
Leon White, II, was given until July 8, 2016, to file an opposition. The Division timely filed its
motion, which, owing to White’s default, I have construed as a motion for sanctions.1
On July 18, 2016, White filed a motion for an extension of time to respond to the
Division’s motion. He asserts that his time in the prison law library is limited, that he is
currently unable to make photocopies of exhibits, and that he requires additional evidence to
oppose the Division’s motion. Though his motion references subpoenas duces tecum “submitted
herewith,” no such subpoenas are attached.
White’s motion was not filed in a timely manner, and he has not explained the substance,
relevance, or scope of the additional evidence he claims is required to respond to the Division’s
motion. Cf. Paul Leon White, II, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3894, 2016 SEC LEXIS
1990, at *8 (ALJ June 6, 2016). However, because he is incarcerated, in order to ensure he has
adequate time to respond to the Division’s motion, I will grant his request for an extension. See
17 C.F.R. § 201.161(a)-(b). White’s opposition to the Division’s motion for sanctions is due
August 8, 2016.2 Given White’s limited resources, he need file only the original version of his
opposition, but he still must serve a copy of his opposition on the Division. If White files an
opposition, the Division’s reply will be due August 18, 2016.

White’s request that his opposition be due thirty days from the receipt of unspecified
“relevant discovery material” is denied.
