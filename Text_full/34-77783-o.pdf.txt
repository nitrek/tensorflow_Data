In the Matter of
Midwest Oil and Gas, Inc.,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the public interest and the
protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of Midwest Oil and Gas,
Inc. (CIK No. 1486315) because of recent, unusual and unexplained market activity in the
company’s stock taking place during a suspicious promotional campaign. Midwest Oil and Gas,
Inc. is a Nevada corporation with its principal executive offices in Payson, Arizona, with stock
quoted on OTC Link (previously “Pinks Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under
the ticker symbol MWOG.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on May 9, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 20, 2016.
By the Commission.
