LAWRENCE R. LUX

ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

Yesterday, I held a telephonic prehearing conference in this matter concerning a number
of requests made by Luigi Agostini, which are detailed in prior orders. See Edward M. Daspin,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4107, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3156 (ALJ Aug. 31, 2016); Edward
M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4067, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2806 (ALJ Aug. 16,
2016). For reasons stated during the conference, Agostini’s requests are DENIED except as
detailed below.
Agostini requested access to the Division of Enforcement’s notes from the interview its
attorneys conducted with Beryl Wolk, who is now deceased. See Edward M. Daspin, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 3156, at *2-3. During yesterday’s conference, I directed the Division to submit its
interview notes for in camera review.
The Division submitted four pages of handwritten notes and two typed pages compiling
the handwritten notes. Having reviewed these materials, I reach the following conclusions. The
Division’s interview notes were prepared in anticipation of litigation. As a result, they constitute
attorney work-product. See United States v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1197-1203 (2d Cir. 1998);
SEC v. Goldstone, 301 F.R.D. 593, 665 (D.N.M. 2014). Because Mr. Wolk passed away in
2014, and because of the passage of time since the events about which he would testify were he
alive, Agostini has shown a substantial need for the Division’s interview notes and an inability,
without undue hardship, to obtain the substantial equivalent of the notes elsewhere. See In re
Grand Jury Investigation, 599 F.2d 1224, 1231-32 (3d Cir. 1979); Hamilton v. Canal Barge Co.,
395 F.Supp. 975, 976-78 (E.D. La. 1974); see also Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1197 (enunciating the
standard for requiring disclosure of work product). I further conclude that the withheld notes
related to Wolk’s interview do not contain exculpatory evidence or Jencks Act material, and
therefore the Division complied with its disclosure obligations under 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.230(b)(2)
and 201.231(a).

Accordingly, the Division shall disclose to Agostini the last two paragraphs on the first
page of its typed notes and everything on the second page. In other words, it should disclose the
six paragraphs of its typed summary that are not in italics.
