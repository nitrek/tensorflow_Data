COMMISSION’S RULES OF
PRACTICE, MAKING FINDINGS,
AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL
SANCTIONS

In the Matter of
David S. Lee , Esq., CPA
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice 1 against David S. Lee, Esq., CPA (“Respondent”).

1

Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:

The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary
hearing, may, by order, ... suspend from appearing or practicing before it any attorney,
accountant, … or other professional or expert who has been by name … permanently enjoined by
any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by
the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the
Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.

II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (“Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose
of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to
the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and over the subject matter of these proceedings, and the
findings contained in Section III.2 below, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
Respondent, age 58, is a resident of Los Altos, California and is a member of the
California State Bar. Respondent was President and a 50% owner of Jim Ward & Associates
(“JWA”) from 2001 until early 2006. Respondent was responsible for, among other duties at JWA,
legal compliance matters, preparing offering materials, property acquisitions, project management,
and overseeing bookkeeping and accounting personnel. From 2002 until at least early 2006, JWA
was investment adviser to Blue Chip Realty Fund LLC (“Blue Chip”) and Respondent was
associated with JWA. During the same period, Respondent held an inactive California CPA license.
2.
On March 22, 2011, the Commission filed a complaint against Respondent and
others in Securities and Exchange Commission v. JSW Financial Inc., et al. (Civil Action No.
11-cv-01356 SC), in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On
January 20, 2016, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Respondent, by consent,
from future violations of Sections 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of
the Advisers Act.
3.
The complaint in the District Court action alleged, inter alia, that Respondent,
together with the other officers of JWA, made materially false and misleading statements to
investors and potential investors in Blue Chip by misrepresenting that investors’ money would be
and was being used to make loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on real estate to a
maximum 65% loan-to-value ratio, and that loans by Blue Chip to affiliates of JWA would not
exceed 25% of Blue Chip’s total assets. The complaint alleged that Respondent and the other
officers knew at least by 2003, or were reckless in not knowing, that the Blue Chip offering
materials were materially false and misleading because investor money was used primarily to make
loans to various entities owned and controlled by the officers on an unsecured basis and in excess of
the maximum 65% loan-to-value ratio. The complaint further alleged that Respondent and the other
officers knew at least by 2004, or were reckless in not knowing, that the Blue Chip offering
materials were materially false and misleading because nearly 90% of Blue Chip’s total assets by
that time were loans to borrowers controlled by the JWA officers.

4.
The conduct that is the basis of Respondent’s permanent injunction arises out of the
conduct of the business of an investment adviser and occurred while Respondent was associated
with an investment adviser.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:
A.

Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, Respondent be, and hereby is:
barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal
securities dealer, or transfer agent.

Any reapplication for association by Respondent will be subject to the applicable laws and
regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned upon a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the following: (a) any
disgorgement ordered against Respondent, whether or not the Commission has fully or partially
waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to the conduct that served
as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-regulatory organization arbitration award to a
customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order;
and (d) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization, whether or not related to the conduct
that served as the basis for the Commission order.
B.
Pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Respondent be,
and hereby is:
suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney or
accountant.
By the Commission.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
