ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding on September 10,
2015, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as a follow-on
proceeding based on SEC v. Kara, No. 3:09-cv-1880 (N.D. Cal.), in which Maher F. Kara was
enjoined against violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act, and United States v.
Kara, No. 3:09-cr-417 (N.D. Cal.), in which Kara was convicted of securities fraud and
conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The parties’ request to file cross-motions for summary
disposition was granted. Maher F. Kara, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3171, 2015 SEC
LEXIS 3950 (A.L.J. Sept. 28, 2015). Briefing is now complete, with the filing of Kara’s reply
brief on January 22, 2016.
Under consideration is Kara’s January 27, 2016, Motion to Postpone Administrative
Proceeding. Kara notes that the United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in a case
arising out of the facts underlying SEC v. Kara and United States v. Kara. Salman v. United
States, No. 15-628, 2016 WL 207256 (U.S. Jan. 19, 2016). Kara urges that a Supreme Court
decision favorable to the petitioner would eliminate the basis of Kara’s conviction and injunction,
and thus, this administrative proceeding. Kara’s motion is, in essence, a request for an indefinite
stay, and will be denied. The Commission’s rules do not authorize the undersigned to grant such
a stay at the request of a party. See 17 C.F.R.§§ 201.161, 360(a)(2).1
IT IS SO ORDERED.

same or similar facts that are at issue in the pending Commission [administrative] proceeding.”
