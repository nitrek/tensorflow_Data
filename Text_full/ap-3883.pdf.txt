ORDER DENYING RESPONDENT
BEDWELL’S MOTION FOR
SUMMARY DISPOSITION

On February 5, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act
of 1933, Sections 4C, 15(b), and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 102(e) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
On May 27, 2016, Respondent Robert P. Bedwell, CPA, filed a motion for summary
disposition. Because dismissal of this proceeding as to Bedwell is squarely foreclosed by
Timbervest, LLC, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 4197, 2015 WL 5472520 (Sept.
17, 2015), appeal pending, No. 15-1416 (D.C. Cir.), the motion is DENIED and the Division of
Enforcement need not respond to it.
Bedwell presents two principal arguments. First, he argues that because the claims
against him first accrued more than five years before issuance of the OIP, the statute of
limitations bars this proceeding as to him. See Motion at 3-9 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2462).
Assuming that Bedwell’s alleged violation occurred more than five years prior to issuance of the
OIP, and further assuming that censure or denial of the privilege of practicing or appearing
before the Commission as an accountant (the only forms of relief authorized by Section 4C and
Rule 102(e)) are equivalent to an associational bar for purposes of Section 2462, Timbervest
holds that Section 2462 is not a barrier to imposing the requested relief. See OIP at 11; 2015 WL
5472520, at *15-16 & n.71. Bedwell also contends that he has suffered evidentiary prejudice
from the passage of time. See Motion at 9-10. Construed as purely an evidentiary issue, this
contention may be raised in post-hearing briefing; construed as alleging the affirmative defense
of laches, it is not cognizable in Commission administrative proceedings. See Robert W.
Armstrong, III, 58 S.E.C. 542, 578 n.74 (2005).

Second, Bedwell argues that Commission administrative law judges are not properly
appointed and are subject to two layers of for-cause removal, in violation of Article II of the U.S.
Constitution. See Motion at 12-15. Timbervest is to the contrary, a point Bedwell candidly
concedes. See 2015 WL 5472520, at *23-28; Motion at 14 n.6 (noting that he “must preserve his
record”). Although it is presently pending on appeal, Timbervest is binding in this proceeding
and squarely forecloses Bedwell’s argument.
Bedwell raises a few other points regarding the propriety of remedial sanctions, which are
best raised in post-hearing briefing and are in any event not amenable to resolution by summary
disposition. See Motion at 10-11.
SO ORDERED.
