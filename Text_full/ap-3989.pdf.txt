ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On June 21, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled for July 18, 2016.
The Division of Enforcement has informed my office, and we have confirmed on
www.usps.com tracking, that Respondents Galileo Petroleum Ltd. and Satori Beverages
International, Ltd., were served with the OIP by June 28, 2016, in accordance with Rule of
Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), (iv), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv). As such, these Respondents’
answers were due by July 11, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). To date, these
Respondents have not filed answers.
I POSTPONE the hearing currently scheduled for July 18, 2016, and schedule a
telephonic prehearing conference for 10:00 a.m. EDT on July 22, 2016. Respondents are on
notice that if they fail to file answers, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend
the proceeding, I will deem them in default, determine that the allegations in the OIP are true,
and revoke the registrations of their securities. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f),
.221(f).
It would be helpful if the Division filed a declaration of service as to all Respondents so
that the record contains evidence on the service issue.
