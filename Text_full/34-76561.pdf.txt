ORDER INSTITUTING
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS
AND NOTICE OF HEARING
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934

Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary
and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be,
and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Respondents Fox Energy Corp.
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A. RESPONDENT
1. Fox Energy Corp. (CIK No. 141166) is a void Delaware corporation located
in St. Joseph, Missouri with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Exchange Act Section 12(g). Fox Energy Corp. is delinquent in its periodic filings
with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended September 30, 2008, which reported a net loss of $3,134 from the
company’s January 11, 2008 inception through September 30, 2008.
B. DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS
2. As discussed in more detail above, the Respondent is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet its obligations to file timely

periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency letters sent to it by the Division of
Corporation Finance requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations or,
through its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by
Commission rules, did not receive such letters.
3. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the
Commission current and accurate information in periodic reports, even if the registration
is voluntary under Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual
reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports.
4. As a result of the foregoing, Respondent failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission
deems it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public
administrative proceedings be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations contained in Section II hereof are true and, in
connection therewith, to afford the Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses
to such allegations; and,
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to
suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each
class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the
Respondent identified in Section II hereof, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules
12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of the Respondent.
IV.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking
evidence on the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and
place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further
order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §
201.110].
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to
the allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as
provided by Rule 220(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].
If Respondent fails to file the directed Answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after
being duly notified, the Respondent, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2
or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any Respondent, may be deemed in default
and the proceedings may be determined against it upon consideration of this Order, the
allegations of which may be deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f),
2

221(f), and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a),
201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 201.310].
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified,
registered, or Express Mail, or by other means permitted by the Commission’s Rules of
Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an
initial decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to
Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the
Commission engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this
or any factually related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the
decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to
notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of
the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section
553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
