Introduction
Regulation S-K was adopted to foster uniform and integrated disclosure for registration

statements under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), registration statements under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and other Exchange Act filings, including
periodic and current reports. 1 Over thirty years ago, the Commission expanded and reorganized
Regulation S-K to be the central repository for its non-financial statement disclosure
requirements. 2 When adopting the integrated disclosure system, the Commission’s goals were to
reduce the costs to registrants and eliminate duplicative disclosures while continuing to provide
material information. 3 In this concept release, we revisit the business and financial disclosure
requirements in Regulation S-K. We seek to assess whether they continue to provide the
information that investors need to make informed investment and voting decisions and whether
any of our rules have become outdated or unnecessary.
We focus this release on business and financial disclosures that registrants provide in
their periodic reports, which are a subset of the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. 4 We
focus on these requirements because many of them have changed little since they were first
adopted. We are not at this time revisiting other disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K, such
as executive compensation and governance, or the required disclosures for foreign private
issuers, business development companies, or other categories of registrants. Although the

The scope of this release does not include certain disclosure requirements for information other than business
and financial disclosures, such as Subpart 400, which requires disclosure about management and certain
security holders as well as corporate governance matters. We also have not included offering-specific
disclosure requirements under Subpart 500, which generally apply to registration statements and prospectuses
but not periodic reports.

6

specific scope of this concept release is as indicated, we welcome and encourage comments on
any other disclosure topics not specifically addressed in this concept release.
This release begins with a discussion of the regulatory history of the integrated disclosure
system and Regulation S-K as well as an overview of prior initiatives to review and modernize
our disclosure requirements. We then present the framework for our current disclosure regime
and explore potential alternative approaches. We proceed to review the business and financial
disclosure requirements that apply to periodic reports. We first consider what financial and
business information should be required and whether any of these requirements are appropriate
to scale for smaller registrants. We then explore how registrants can most effectively present this
information to improve its usefulness to investors. In this release, we consider input we have
received from letters submitted in response to disclosure modernization efforts 5 as well as the
staff’s experience with particular disclosure requirements, regulatory history and changes in the
regulatory and business landscape since the rule’s adoption.
Through this release, we are reviewing and seeking public comment on whether our
business and financial disclosure requirements continue to elicit important information for
investors and how registrants can most effectively present this information. We are specifically
seeking comment on:
•

whether, and if so, how specific disclosures are important or useful to making investment
and voting decisions and whether more, less or different information might be needed;

5

See infra notes 9 to 10 and accompanying text.

7

•

whether, and if so how, we could revise our current requirements to enhance the
information provided to investors while considering whether the action will promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation; 6

•

whether, and if so how, we could revise our requirements to enhance the protection of
investors;

•

whether our current requirements appropriately balance the costs of disclosure with the
benefits;

•

whether, and if so how, we could lower the cost to registrants of providing information to
investors, including considerations such as advancements in technology and
communications;

•

whether and if so, how we could increase the benefits to investors and facilitate investor
access to disclosure by modernizing the methods used to present, aggregate and
disseminate disclosure; and

•

any challenges of our current disclosure requirements and those that may result from
possible regulatory responses explored in this release or suggested by commenters.

While we set forth a number of general and specific questions, we welcome comments from
investors, registrants and other market participants on any other concerns related to our
disclosure requirements. In addition to comments received on this release, we will consider any
input from investor focus group studies or surveys, the Investor Advisory Committee and the
Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies.
6

Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(f)] requires that, whenever the Commission is engaged in
rulemaking under the Exchange Act and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall also consider, in addition to the protection of investors,
whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and capital formation. Section 2(b) of the Securities
Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] sets forth this same requirement. See also Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C 78w(a)(2)].

This concept release is part of a comprehensive evaluation of the Commission’s
disclosure requirements recommended in the staff’s Report on Review of Disclosure
Requirements in Regulation S-K (“S-K Study”), which was mandated by Section 108 of the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). 7 Based on the S-K Study’s recommendation
and at the request of Commission Chair Mary Jo White, 8 Commission staff initiated a
comprehensive evaluation of the type of information our rules require registrants to disclose,
how this information is presented, where and how this information is disclosed and how we can
leverage technology as part of these efforts (collectively, “Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative”).
The overall objective of the Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative is to improve our disclosure
regime for both investors and registrants.
In connection with the S-K Study9 and the subsequent launch of the Disclosure
Effectiveness Initiative, 10 we received public comments on various topics discussed in this
release. Below and elsewhere throughout this release, we discuss these comments as further
context for the topics under consideration. Comments received in connection with the
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative that are outside the scope of this release are not discussed
here. These comment letters are being considered as part of the staff’s continued evaluation of
7

Pub. L. No. 112-106, Sec. 108, 126 Stat. 306 (2012). Section 108 of the JOBS Act required the Commission to
conduct a review of Regulation S-K to determine how such requirements can be updated to modernize and
simplify the registration process for emerging growth companies (“EGCs”). For a further discussion of the S-K
Study, see Section II.C.

Regulation S-K from which the staff expects to make further recommendations to the
Commission for consideration.
The staff is also working on recommendations for our consideration to propose specific
revisions to update or simplify certain of our business and financial disclosure requirements, as
required by the recently enacted Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015 (“FAST
Act”). 11 Those recommendations relate to specific proposals to help address “duplicative,
overlapping, outdated or unnecessary” disclosure and are not specifically addressed in this
concept release, which seeks to explore both general considerations and specific questions that
we believe would benefit from further evaluation and input before proposing any changes to the
related rules. 12
II.

Relevant History and Background
A.

History of Regulation S-K

Regulation S-K
Enactment of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act resulted in the creation of two
separate disclosure regimes. These disclosure regimes remained distinct for approximately thirty
years and often resulted in overlapping and duplicative disclosure requirements. Regulation S-K
reflects the Commission’s efforts to harmonize disclosure required under both the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act by creating a single repository for disclosure regulation that applies to
filings by registrants under both statutes.

The current integrated disclosure system resulted from a series of efforts triggered by a
1964 amendment to the Exchange Act, 13 which added Section 12(g) to the Exchange Act and
extended the Exchange Act’s reporting requirements to companies meeting specified thresholds,
including those that were not exchange listed. 14 In light of the Exchange Act’s broadened
reporting requirements, Professor Milton Cohen suggested in a seminal 1966 law review article
greater coordination between the Securities Act and Exchange Act. 15 He recommended that the
continuous reporting obligations under the Exchange Act serve as the foundation for corporate
disclosure while relaxing or eliminating overlapping Securities Act disclosure requirements. 16
Subsequent to the publication of this article, the Commission initiated several studies that
advanced efforts to integrate the Securities Act and Exchange Act disclosure regimes. These

Acts, Policy Study, Mar. 27, 1969, available at http://www.sechistorical.org/museum/galleries/tbi/gogo_d.php
(“Wheat Report”) (stating that one of the reasons for a broad re-examination of disclosure policy was the 1964
amendment to the Exchange Act). See also infra note 15.

14

15 U.S.C. 781(g). Congress enacted Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act in 1964, which required an issuer to
register a class of securities under Section 12(g) if the securities were “held of record” by 500 or more persons
and the issuer had total assets exceeding $1 million. Prior to the enactment of Section 12(g), the Exchange Act
reporting requirements were applicable only to listed companies. The Commission used its authority under
Section 12(h) to raise the asset threshold for Section 12(g) registration from $1 million to $3 million in 1982, $5
million in 1986 and $10 million in 1996.
As a result of amendments made by the JOBS Act and the FAST Act, Section 12(g)(1) of the Exchange Act
now requires an issuer that is not a bank, bank holding company, or savings and loan holding company to
register a class of equity securities if the securities are held of record by either (i) 2,000 persons, or (ii) 500
persons who are not accredited investors and the issuer has total assets exceeding $10 million. Banks, bank
holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with total assets exceeding $10 million must
register a class of equity securities if the securities are held of record by 2,000 or more persons. Pub. L. No.
112-106, Sec. 501, 126 Stat. 306 (2012) and Pub. L. No. 114-94, Sec. 85001, 129 Stat. 1312 (2015).

15

See Milton H. Cohen, “Truth in Securities” Revisited, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1340, 1350 (1966) (“With the 1934 Act
now extended to thousands of additional companies by the 1964 Amendments, the need of a reexamination with
an eye to coordination of the 1934 Act with the earlier one is all the greater”).

16

See id. at 1341-42, stating “[i]t is my thesis that the combined disclosure requirement of these statutes would
have been quite different if the 1933 and 1934 Acts (the latter as extended in 1964) had been enacted in
opposite order, or had been enacted as a single, integrated statute—that is, if the starting point had been a
statutory scheme of continuous disclosures covering issuers of actively traded securities and the question of
special disclosures in connection with public offerings had been faced in this setting. Accordingly, it is my plea
that there now be created a new coordinated disclosure system having as its basis the continuous disclosure
system of the 1934 Act and treating “1933 Act” disclosure needs on this foundation.”

11

efforts included the Disclosure Policy Study led by Commissioner Francis Wheat 17 and the
report issued by the Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure led by former Commissioner
A. A. Sommer, Jr. (“Sommer Report”). 18 In 1969, the Wheat Report concurred with Cohen’s
proposal for a coordinated disclosure system. It recommended an enhanced degree of
coordination between the disclosures required by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
formulated specific proposals for integrating disclosure between the two Acts. 19 In 1977, the
Sommer Report suggested adopting a single, integrated disclosure system and recommended
developing one coordinated disclosure form. 20
Following the Sommer Report, the Commission adopted the first version of Regulation
S-K, which included only two disclosure requirements — a description of business and a
description of properties. 21 While additional disclosure requirements were added in 1978 and
1980, 22 Regulation S-K was significantly expanded and reorganized in 1982 as the repository
for the uniform non-financial statement disclosure requirements under both the Securities Act
and Exchange Act. 23 With this expansion and reorganization, the Commission moved much of

the guidance in the prior Industry Guides into Regulation S-K and amended the forms and
schedules to reference requirements in Regulation S-K. 24
Many of the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K originated in Schedule A of the
Securities Act, which lists 27 items that must be disclosed in a registration statement and
prospectus. 25 Section 7 of the Securities Act provides that the registration statement shall
contain the information and be accompanied by the documents specified in Schedule A, except
the Commission may exercise its rulemaking authority to prescribe additional information or
may permit prescribed information to be omitted as it deems necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. 26 Over the years, the Commission has exercised
this authority to adopt various registration forms and disclosure requirements. While many of
the disclosure requirements currently in Regulation S-K originated in Schedule A, the
Commission has amended Regulation S-K numerous times since its adoption. 27
B.

Broad Economic Considerations

The purpose of corporate disclosure is to provide investors with information they need to
make informed investment and voting decisions. Lowering information asymmetries between
managers of companies and investors may enhance capital formation and the allocative
efficiency of the capital markets. In particular, disclosure of information that is important for

24

For a discussion of the Industry Guides, see infra notes 639 to 644 and accompanying text.

25

15 U.S.C. 77aa. Schedule A requires companies to provide information such as: general information about the
company, its business and capital structure; information about the directors, principal officers, promoters and
ten percent stockholders and remuneration of officers and directors; information about the offering; financial
statements of the company and of any business to be acquired through the proceeds of the issue; and copies of
agreements made with underwriters, opinions of counsel on legality of the issue, material contracts, the
company’s organizational documents and agreements or indentures affecting any securities offered.

Study at 8-92.

13

investment and voting decisions may lead to more accurate share prices, discourage fraud,
heighten monitoring of the managers of companies, and increase liquidity. Effective disclosure
requirements also should increase the integrity of securities markets, build investor confidence,
and support the provision of capital to the market. In addition, such requirements can facilitate
the coordination of registrants around consistent disclosure standards, increasing the efficiency
with which investors can process the information.
There are potential drawbacks associated with disclosure requirements. Disclosure can
be costly for registrants to produce and disseminate, and disclosure of certain sensitive
information can result in competitive disadvantages. There is also a possibility that high levels
of immaterial disclosure can obscure important information or reduce incentives for certain
market participants to trade or create markets for securities. The appropriate choice of disclosure
requirements therefore involves certain tradeoffs. These tradeoffs may depend on the nature of
the audience for disclosure and the characteristics of registrants.
Markets are composed of a broad spectrum of investors with different information needs.
Some investors may be highly sophisticated and have access to substantial resources to process
and interpret data, while others may lack sophistication or have fewer resources to process and
interpret data. Investors also may differ in their reliance on disclosure or on third-party analyses
of disclosure. The breadth of the audience for disclosure may inform choices about what
information is important to investment and voting decisions and should therefore be disclosed.
The diversity of the audience for disclosure, and how different subsets of this audience access
and digest information about registrants, will also affect decisions about how best to format and
disseminate disclosure.

14

The trade-off between the benefits and costs of disclosure requirements may vary across
different types of registrants. For example, to the extent that our disclosure requirements impose
fixed costs, they may impose a disproportionate burden on smaller registrants. At the same time,
these registrants may have relatively simple operations and thus be able to promote an
understanding of their business and financial condition with less disclosure than larger, more
complex registrants. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to provide disclosure accommodations
for certain types of registrants, while remaining cognizant of the potential adverse impacts that
reduced disclosure may have on capital formation and the allocative efficiency of the capital
markets.
The benefits associated with disclosing certain items of information may be greater in
some cases than in others, such as when an item of disclosure reflects an important part of one
registrant’s operations but an immaterial part of another’s. In this context, it may be important to
consider various approaches to trigger disclosure where it is more likely to be important, rather
than in all cases. It may also be useful to have disclosure requirements, or guidance in fulfilling
these requirements, that are specific to certain industries or other subsets of registrants. We seek
to understand if disclosure requirements can be more appropriately tailored to registrants given
the likely variation across registrants in the benefits and the costs of disclosing certain types of
information. We discuss specific economic considerations in more detail below.
C.

Prior Regulation S-K Modernization Initiatives and Studies

From time to time, the Commission has assessed its disclosure requirements. Several of
these studies focused on modernizing or simplifying disclosure requirements. Other initiatives
focused on different aspects of the regulatory framework, such as the securities offering process
or the financial reporting system, but had the effect of raising disclosure issues for further

15

consideration or shaping current disclosure requirements. The Disclosure Effectiveness
Initiative builds upon these prior studies and initiatives.
Task Force on Disclosure Simplification
The Task Force on Disclosure Simplification (“Task Force”), comprising staff from
across the Commission, was formed in 1995 to review regulations affecting capital formation
with a view towards “streamlining, simplifying, and modernizing the overall regulatory scheme
without compromising or diminishing important investor protections.” 28 In its report to the
Commission in 1996, the Task Force recommended the Commission “eliminate or modify many
rules and forms, and simplify several key aspects of securities offerings.” 29 Based on the Task
Force’s recommendations, the Commission rescinded forty-five rules and six forms and adopted
other minor or technical rule changes to eliminate unnecessary requirements and to streamline
the disclosure process. 30
The Task Force also made the following recommendations on Regulation S-K:

28

See Report of the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification, available at www.sec.gov/news/studies/smpl.htm
(Mar. 5, 1996) (“Task Force Report”). To facilitate its review, the Task Force met with issuers, investor groups,
underwriters, accounting firms, law firms and other active participants in the capital markets.

29

See id. stating “…recommendations [of the task force] roughly fall into three categories: 1) Weeding out forms
and regulations that are duplicative of other requirements or have outlived their usefulness; 2) Requiring more
readable and informative disclosure documents; and 3) Reducing the cost of securities offerings and increasing
access of smaller companies to the securities markets.”

30

See Phase One Recommendations of Task Force on Disclosure Simplification, Release No. 33-7300 (May 31,
1996) [61 FR 30397 (June 14, 1996)] (“Phase One Recommendations of Task Force on Disclosure
Simplification Release”). For example, changes to Regulation S-K included eliminating four infrequently used
(or otherwise already available) items from the list of required exhibits in Item 601(b) (opinion regarding
discount on capital shares, opinion regarding liquidation preference, material foreign patents, and information
from reports furnished to state insurance regulatory authorities).
See also Phase Two Recommendations of Task Force on Disclosure Simplification, Release No. 33-7431 (July
18, 1997) [62 FR 43581 (Aug. 14, 1997)] (“Phase Two Recommendations of Task Force on Disclosure
Simplification Release”) (rescinding two forms and one rule and amending a number of rules and forms). The
Commission further implemented certain of the recommendations in the Task Force Report relating to
accounting disclosure rules that were identified as being largely duplicative of U.S. GAAP or other Commission
rules.

16

•

streamline Item 101’s description of business disclosure by eliminating duplication of
quantitative information about business segments and foreign operations provided in the
financial statements;

•

revise Item 102’s description of property disclosure to elicit “more meaningful and
material disclosure;” and

•

eliminate Item 103’s instruction to replace the $100,000 standard with a general
materiality standard for certain environmental legal proceedings to ensure registrants will
not be required to disclose non-material information. 31

While the Commission made a number of changes in response to the Task Force
recommendations, the three items identified above were not adopted by the Commission. We
revisit some of these issues in the questions presented below.
Report of the Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Process
Also in 1995, the Commission established the Advisory Committee on the Capital
Formation and Regulatory Processes (“1995 Advisory Committee”) to advise on, among other
things, the regulatory process and disclosure requirements for public offerings. The 1995
Advisory Committee’s primary recommendation was implementing a system of “company
registration.” 32

31

The Task Force also generally recommended adjusting certain dollar thresholds in Regulation S-K and
Regulation S-X for inflation since the time of their adoption. The Task Force cited, among other items, the
$50,000 threshold in Item 509 of Regulation S-K (relating to disclosure of payments to experts and counsel) [17
CFR 229.509] and the $100,000 threshold in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X (relating to the definition of an
inactive registrant) [17 CFR 210.3-11]. See Task Force Report.

32

Under a “company registration” system, a company would, on a one-time basis, file a registration statement
(deemed effective immediately) that includes information similar to that currently provided in an initial shortform shelf registration statement. This registration statement could then be used for all types of securities and
all types of offerings. All current and future Exchange Act reports would be incorporated by reference into that
registration statement, and around the time of an offering, transactional and updating disclosures would be filed
with the Commission and incorporated into the registration statement. As part of this “company registration”
system, companies would be required to adopt certain disclosure enhancements (and encouraged to adopt

17

Noting the Task Force Report, the 1995 Advisory Committee did not focus on specific
line-item disclosure requirements but suggested disclosure enhancements as part of its
recommendations for a system of “company registration.” These enhancements included a
management certification to the Commission for all periodic and current reports, a
management’s report to the audit committee to be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K,
expansion of current reporting obligations on Form 8-K and a risk factor disclosure requirement
in Form 10-K. 33
After receiving reports from both the Task Force and the 1995 Advisory Committee, the
Commission issued a concept release on regulation of the securities offering process and also
sought input on the 1995 Advisory Committee’s proposed disclosure enhancements. 34
Plain English
In 1998, the Commission adopted rules intended to improve the readability of
prospectuses by promoting clear, concise and understandable disclosure (“Plain English

others) that seek to improve the quality and timeliness of disclosure provided to investors and the markets. See
Securities Act Concepts and Their Effects on Capital Formation, Release No. 33-7314 (July 25, 1996) [61 FR
40044 (July 31, 1996)] (“Securities Act Concept Release”).

See Report of The Advisory Committee on the Capital Formation and Regulatory Processes (July 24, 1996),
available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/capform.htm.

34

See the Securities Act Concept Release. Many of the issues raised in the concept release were revisited in the
Commission’s 1998 proposal to modernize the securities offering process (known as the “Aircraft Carrier”
release), and in the Commission’s 2005 Securities Offering Reform rulemaking. Some of the proposals from
the Aircraft Carrier release were later adopted. For example, the Aircraft Carrier release recommended
inclusion of risk factor disclosure in Exchange Act registration statements and annual reports. This
recommendation was adopted as part of Securities Offering Reform. See The Regulation of Securities
Offerings, Release No. 33-7606A (Nov. 17, 1998) [63 FR 67174 (Dec. 4, 1998)] (“Aircraft Carrier Release”)

Rules”). 35 These rules required registrants to write the cover page, summary and risk factors
section of prospectuses in plain English 36 and were extended to Exchange Act reports in 2005. 37
Advisory Committee on Improvements to Financial Reporting
In 2007, the Commission chartered the Advisory Committee on Improvements to
Financial Reporting (“CIFiR Advisory Committee”) to examine the U.S. financial reporting
system. 38 While the CIFiR Advisory Committee did not recommend specific changes to
Regulation S-K, several of its suggestions sought to improve the usefulness of information in
periodic reports. 39 The Commission adopted some of these suggestions, which included
updating the Commission’s interpretive guidance on use of electronic media for disseminating
information on a registrant’s financial performance 40 and adopting rules to require filing of
interactive data-tagged financial statements. 41

35

See Plain English Disclosure, Release No. 33-7497 (Jan. 28, 1998) [63 FR 6370 (Feb. 6, 1998)] (“Plain English
Disclosure Adopting Release”).

36

Id.

37

See Securities Offering Reform Release. As part of the Securities Offering Reform Release, Form 10-K was
amended to require risk factor disclosure to be written in accordance with the same Plain English Rules that
apply to risk factor disclosure in Securities Act registration statements. See also Part I, Item 1A of Form 10-K.

38

The dual goals of the CIFiR Advisory Committee were “to examine the U.S. financial reporting system in order
to make recommendations intended to increase the usefulness of financial information to investors, while
reducing the complexity of the financial reporting system to investors, preparers, and auditors.” See Final
Report of the Advisory Committee on Improvements to Financial Reporting to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (Aug. 1, 2008), (“CIFiR Advisory Committee Report”), available at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oca/acifr/acifr-finalreport.pdf.

39

See CIFiR Advisory Committee Report (stating that “[i]ncreasing the usefulness of information in SEC reports”
was one of five themes underlying the CIFiR Advisory Committee’s recommendations).

40

In 2008, the Commission published interpretive guidance on the use of company websites as a means for
companies to communicate and provide information to investors in compliance with the federal securities laws
and, in particular, the Exchange Act. See Commission Guidance on the Use of Company Web Sites, Release
No. 34-58288 (Aug. 1, 2008) [73 FR 45862 (Aug. 7, 2008)] (“2008 Website Guidance”). When it published the
2008 Website Guidance, the Commission noted that the guidance was prompted, in part, by the CIFiR Advisory
Committee’s efforts.

41

In 2008, the Commission announced the 21st Century Disclosure Initiative, with the goal of preparing a plan for
future action to modernize the Commission’s disclosure system. The Initiative’s report, issued in 2009,
recommended a new disclosure system in which interactive data would replace plain-text disclosure documents
while retaining the substantive content and filing schedule of the current system. See 21st Century Disclosure

JOBS Act Report on Review of Disclosure Requirements in Regulation S-K
The JOBS Act required the Commission to review Regulation S-K to determine how its
disclosure requirements can be updated to modernize and simplify the registration process for
EGCs. 42 In response to this mandate, Commission staff published the S-K Study in December
2013. Although the Congressional mandate focused on EGCs, the report was intended to
facilitate the improvement of disclosure requirements applicable to companies at all stages of
development. 43
The S-K Study recommended a comprehensive review of disclosure requirements in the
Commission’s rules and forms, including Regulations S-K and S-X, and identified specific areas
for further review. 44 It also recommended the Commission consider the following principles
when reviewing and evaluating changes to disclosure requirements:
•

improving and maintaining the informativeness of disclosure;

Initiative: Staff Report, Toward Greater Transparency: Modernizing the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Disclosure System (Jan. 2009), available at
http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/disclosureinitiative/report.pdf.
The Commission adopted rules in 2009 requiring companies to provide financial statement information in
interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”) format. See Interactive
Data to Improve Financial Reporting, Release No. 33-9002 (Jan. 20, 2009) [74 FR 6776 (Feb. 10, 2009)]

require filing of interactive data-tagged financial statements.

43

See S-K Study at 4.

44

See id at 92-104. The S-K Study identified four issues for further study: (1) generally, any recommended
revisions should emphasize a principles-based approach as an overarching component of the disclosure
framework while preserving the benefits of a rules-based system; (2) any review of the disclosure requirements
should evaluate the appropriateness of current scaled disclosure requirements and consider whether further
scaling is appropriate for EGCs or other categories of companies; (3) any review of the disclosure requirements
should evaluate methods of information delivery and presentation, both through EDGAR and other means; and
(4) any review of disclosure requirements should consider ways to present information to improve the
readability and navigability of disclosure and explore methods for discouraging repetition and disclosure of
immaterial information. As to this fourth issue, the S-K Study suggested reevaluating quantitative thresholds
and other materiality standards in Regulation S-K as well as reassessing requirements for information that is
readily accessible, such as historical stock price information. Id. at 97-98.

•

historical objectives of the rule and their continued or recurring relevance;

•

whether the required information is available on a non-discriminatory basis from reliable
sources and, if so, any costs or benefits from obtaining the information other than from
the registrant;

•

administrative and compliance costs of the requirements;

•

any competitive or economic costs of disclosing proprietary information;

•

maintenance of the Commission’s ability to conduct an effective enforcement program
and deter fraud; and

•

importance of maintaining investor confidence in the reliability of registrant information,
in order to, among other things, encourage capital formation. 45
FAST Act Disclosure Modernization and Simplification
Under the FAST Act, 46 the Commission is required to carry out a study to determine how

best to modernize and simplify the disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K and to propose
revisions to those requirements. 47 The FAST Act requires that the study of Regulation S-K:
•

emphasize a company-by-company approach that allows relevant and material
information to be disseminated to investors without boilerplate language or static
requirements while preserving completeness and comparability of information across
registrants; and

•

evaluate methods of information delivery and presentation and explore methods for
discouraging repetition and the disclosure of immaterial information.

21

In conducting this study, the Commission is required to consult with the Investor Advisory
Committee and the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies and to issue a
report of findings and recommendations to Congress. 48 The FAST Act also requires the
Commission to revise Regulation S-K to further scale or eliminate requirements to reduce the
burden on EGCs, accelerated filers, smaller reporting companies (“SRCs”), and other smaller
issuers, while still providing all material information to investors, and to eliminate duplicative,
overlapping, outdated or superseded provisions. 49
Consistent with the S-K Study’s recommendations and the FAST Act mandates, and in
furtherance of the Commission’s prior modernization studies and initiatives, we seek to evaluate
components of our disclosure framework and revisit certain of our business and financial
disclosure requirements to assess whether they continue to provide investors with information
that is important to making informed investment and voting decisions. We also seek to evaluate
whether current disclosure requirements should be revised to include different formats to
facilitate the readability and navigability of disclosure, which we discuss in Section V of the
release.

22

investors. 50 The Commission has used this authority to require disclosure of information it
believes is important to investors in both registration statements for public offerings and in
ongoing reports.
1.

Statutory Mandates

The Securities Act and Exchange Act
A central goal of the federal securities laws is full and fair disclosure. 51 In enacting these
laws, Congress recognized that investors must have access to accurate information important to
making investment and voting decisions in order for the financial markets to function effectively.
Thus, our disclosure rules are intended not only to protect investors but also to facilitate capital
formation and maintain fair, orderly and efficient capital markets.
Schedule A of the Securities Act sets forth certain items of disclosure to be included in
registration statements filed in public offerings and provides the basis for many of the disclosure
requirements currently in Regulation S-K. Items in Schedule A are largely financial in nature
and were intended to help investors assess a security’s value. According to the House Report
that preceded the Securities Act:
The items required to be disclosed…are items indispensable to any accurate judgment
upon the value of a security…The type of information required to be disclosed is of a
50

See generally, Sections 7, 10, and 19(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77g(a)(10, 77j; and 77s(a)]; and
Sections 3(b), 12, 13, 14, 15(d), and 23(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(b), 78l, 78m(a), 78n(a), 78o(d),
and 78w(a)].

51

See Preamble of the Securities Act (stating it is an Act to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of
securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and to prevent frauds in the sale
thereof, and for other purposes.). In enacting the mandatory disclosure system under the Exchange Act,
Congress sought to promote complete and accurate information in the secondary trading markets. See S. Rep.
No. 73-1455, 73rd Cong., 2nd Sess., 1934 at 68 (stating “[o]ne of the prime concerns of the exchanges should
be to make available to the public, honest, complete, and correct information regarding the securities listed”)
and H.R. Rep. No. 73-1383, 73rd Cong., 2nd Sess., 1934 at 11 (stating “[t]here cannot be honest markets
without honest publicity. Manipulation and dishonest practices of the market place thrive upon mystery and
secrecy.”).

23

character comparable to that demanded by competent bankers from their borrowers, and
has been worked out in light of these and other requirements. They are…adequate to
bring into full glare of publicity those elements of real and unreal values which may lie
behind a security. 52
The Exchange Act requires similar business and financial information to be disclosed in
Exchange Act registration statements and periodic reports. 53
In addition to mandating certain disclosure requirements, the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act grant the Commission authority to modify and supplement these requirements as
necessary or appropriate to implement the purpose of the statutes. 54 Moreover, whenever it is
engaged in rulemaking and is required to consider whether the action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, the Commission must consider whether the action will promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 55
Business and Financial Legislation
From time to time, Congress has introduced additional disclosure requirements through
other statutory mandates. Recent mandates have focused on corporate responsibility, corporate

See Section 12(b)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78l].

See, e.g., Sections 19(a) and 28 of the Securities Act and Sections 3(b), 23(a)(1) and 36(a)(1) of the Exchange
Act. [15 U.S.C. 77s(a), 15 U.S.C. 77z-3] and [15 U.S.C. 78c(b), 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. 78mm(a)(1)].
Section 19(a) of the Securities Act and Section 23(a)(1) of the Exchange Act grant the Commission authority to
make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of each title; Section 3(b) of the
Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall have power to define technical, trade, accounting, and other
terms used in the Exchange Act, consistently with the provisions and purposes of the Exchange Act; Section 28
of the Securities Act and Section 36(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provide that the Commission may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or
transactions, from any provision or provisions of each title or of any rule or regulation thereunder, to the extent
that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of
investors.

governance and providing enhanced business and financial information to investors. The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) 56 mandated numerous changes to
strengthen the accountability of public companies for their financial disclosure and required
substantial Commission rulemaking to implement its provisions, many of which resulted in
additions to Regulation S-K. 57 In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) 58 required the Commission to adopt an array of disclosure
provisions on corporate governance, executive compensation and specialized disclosure. 59
Other Legislation
In some instances, Congress has mandated disclosure that is not necessarily financial in
nature. These mandates have ranged from broad policy considerations to prescriptive directives.
For example, under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”), 60 Congress
required all federal agencies to include consideration of the environment in regulatory action. In
response to this mandate, the Commission adopted environmental compliance and litigation
disclosure requirements. 61 Similarly, Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act required registrants to

61

As a result of NEPA, the Commission issued an interpretive release in 1971 alerting companies to potential
disclosure obligations that could arise from material environmental litigation and the material effects of
compliance with environmental laws. The Commission later adopted more specific disclosure requirements
relating to these matters and, in 1976, the Commission amended its forms to require disclosure of any material
estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

include information about mine safety and health in their periodic reports. Although the
disclosure requirements in Section 1503 were self-executing, 62 the Act authorized the
Commission to issue such rules or regulations as necessary for the protection of investors and to
carry out the purposes of Section 1503. 63 To facilitate consistent compliance, the Commission
adopted rules to codify the statutory disclosure requirements. 64 More recently, the Iran Threat
Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRSHRA”) requires registrants to disclose
certain business activities relating to Iran in their periodic reports. 65
2.

Commission Responses to Market Developments

Our disclosure regime includes requirements that we have adopted in response to market
developments or advancements in technology. In response to the disorderly markets and damage
to investors caused by the hot issue securities markets between 1967 and 1971, the Commission
initiated hearings to determine the adequacy of existing disclosure requirements 66 and adopted

and Final Action on Rulemaking Proposals Relating to Environmental Disclosure, Release No. 33-5704 (May 6,
1976) [41 FR 21632 (May 27, 1976)] (“1976 Environmental Release”), Natural Resources Defense Council et
al., v. SEC, 389 F. Supp. 689 (D.D.C. 1974) (“Natural Resources Defense Council”).
62

See Section 1503(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The disclosure requirements took effect 30 days after enactment of
the Act.

63

Id. at Section 1503(d)(2).

64

See Mine Safety Disclosure, Release No. 33-9286 (Dec. 21, 2011) [76 FR 81762 (Dec. 28, 2011)] (“Mine
Safety Disclosure Release”).

65

Pub. L. No. 112-158, 126 Stat. 1214 (2012). Section 219 of ITRSHRA amended Section 13 of the Exchange
Act to add subsection (r). This subsection requires a company that files annual and quarterly reports under
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act to provide disclosure if, during the reporting period, it or any of its affiliates
knowingly engaged in certain specified activities involving contacts with or support for Iran or other identified
persons involved in terrorism or the creation of weapons of mass destruction. ITRSHRA was self-executing
and required no substantive rulemaking by the Commission.

66

Hot issues result when the price of a new issuance of securities rises to a substantial premium over the initial
offering price immediately or soon after the securities are first distributed to the public. In 1967-1971, the new
issues markets experienced a resurgence. See Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission Concerning
the Hot Issues Markets, August 1984, available at http://3197d6d14b5f19f2f4405e13d29c4c016cf96cbbfd197c579b45.r81.cf1.rackcdn.com/collection/papers/1980/1984_0801_SECHotIssuesT
.pdf. Between 1968 and 1970, the value of stocks traded on national securities exchanges fell a total of $78.8
billion, from $759.5 billion to $680.7 billion. See Securities and Exchange Commission, Thirty-Seventh
Annual Report, appendix Table 5 at 221 (1971) available at https://www.sec.gov/about/annual_report/1971.pdf.

new disclosure requirements to elicit more meaningful information concerning all registrants and
to communicate more effectively the economic realities of new registrants. 67 Similarly, in 1994
in response to significant and sometimes unexpected losses in market risk sensitive instruments
due to, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices, the Commission adopted Item 305 (quantitative and qualitative disclosures
about market risk). 68
Significant advancements in technology have also prompted some of our disclosure
requirements. The Commission’s efforts in Securities Offering Reform recognized the impact of
technology on market demand for more timely corporate disclosure and the ability of issuers to
capture, process, and disseminate this information. 69 Similarly, modernization of our oil and gas
rules was intended to update oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current
practices and changes in technology. 70
We are considering changes to our disclosure requirements and seeking public input on
how our disclosure requirements could be improved for the benefit of investors and registrants
and whether the requirements could be revised to adapt to future changes in market conditions
and advancements in technology. We also are seeking input on the utility of mechanisms such as
sunset provisions or temporary rules.

Comments Received

S-K Study. One commenter stated that a sunset provision would require the Commission
to consider changes in the economic, business and regulatory landscape in assessing whether
new disclosure requirements should be made permanent. 71 For significant new disclosure
requirements, this commenter suggested a sunset provision of five or ten years and that formal
Commission action should be required to indefinitely extend or modify any significant new
disclosure requirement.
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. We received a few comment letters that discussed
potential regulatory mechanisms to review and update our disclosure requirements. 72 To
determine the continuing need for disclosures in light of the then current economic, business and
regulatory landscape, one commenter suggested a formal, post-adoption review process for
significant new disclosure requirements. 73 This review process, or “sunset review,” would
require formal Commission action to make a new disclosure requirement permanent. Another
commenter recommended that the Commission develop a mechanism to timely update disclosure
requirements to address new topical issues and to delete existing disclosure when the
informational value for investors is diminished. 74 One commenter generally recommended

Discussion

When adopting disclosure requirements that have departed from traditional disclosure
concepts, the Commission has historically taken an incremental approach to change by first
adopting modest revisions and then expanding their application after observing and evaluating
the rules’ effectiveness. For example, the initial adoption of simplified registration and reporting
requirements for smaller businesses on Form S-18 were “in the nature of an experiment” 76 and a
departure from traditional disclosure concepts. 77 After observing relative, widespread
acceptance of Form S-18 and the absence of significant disclosure or enforcement problems, the
Commission expanded the form’s availability, 78 and it eventually served as a model for our
current system of scaled disclosure for SRCs. 79
The Commission has, on occasion, adopted temporary rules or rules with automatic
sunset provisions to better assess the effect of or necessity for a particular rule before adopting
the rule on a permanent basis. For example, Securities Act Rule 415, which permits delayed and

Commission stated “[t]he amendments that we are adopting address the need to revisit and adjust the
Commission’s small company policies to reflect changes in our securities markets as well as changes to the
regulatory landscape since 1992, when the Commission first adopted an integrated scaled disclosure system for
small business in Regulation S-B. The Commission adopted Regulation S-B and its associated Forms SB-1 and
SB-2 based upon the success of Form S-18…”

a period of nine months during which the Commission monitored the operation and impact of the
new rule. 80 Following public hearings and comment on Rule 415, the Commission determined
additional experience with the rule was necessary to study its operation and impact 81 and
extended the temporary nature of this rule. 82 The Commission permanently adopted Rule 415
following 18 months of monitoring the operation and impact of the rule. 83
While the Commission acted to permanently adopt Rule 415, it has allowed other
temporary rules to expire. The Commission adopted on a temporary basis Securities Act Rules
702 and 703. Rule 702 required the filing of a Form 701 after sales under Rule 701 exceeded a
particular threshold. Rule 703 disqualified registrants from relying on the Rule 701 exemption
from registration where the registrant failed to make the filing required by Rule 702. 84 In
adopting Rules 702 and 703, the Commission noted the importance of monitoring new
exemptive provisions and stated that it would use Form 701 to “assess the utility of the
exemption and, oversee any abuses.” 85 The Commission did not extend Rules 702 and 703

based on its belief that the sunset of these rules had not compromised investor interests and that
their reinstitution of the rules would serve little purpose. 86
Even in the absence of a temporary rule or sunset provision, the Commission has
undertaken efforts to study the effects of new rules or amendments. The Commission uses these
studies to guide future amendments or rulemaking. For example, our staff has examined the
effects on capital formation through private placements after adoption of amendments to
Regulation D in accordance with the JOBS Act. 87 In adopting amendments to Rule 506 of
Regulation D 88 to eliminate the prohibition against general solicitation for a subset of Rule 506
offerings, the Commission stated that the staff will monitor developments in the market for these
offerings. 89 In addition, in connection with recently adopted amendments to Regulation A, an
exemption from registration for smaller issues of securities, and the adoption of Regulation
Crowdfunding, a new exemption for smaller securities offerings using the Internet through
crowdfunding, the Commission stated, in each case, that the staff will study and submit a report
to the Commission on the impact of the regulation on capital formation and investor protection. 90

requirements, the utility of which may change over time, could require us to more frequently

types of issuers using the exemption, level of compliance by issuers and intermediaries, and whether the
exemption is promoting new capital formation while providing key protections for investors. See

consider the effectiveness of our requirements. Alternatively, the Commission could commit to
studying the impact of certain rule changes on a specified schedule, without making the rules
temporary or applying automatic sunset provisions. Any such review would be in addition to the
periodic review currently required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”), 91 under which the
Commission reviews its rules that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities within ten years of their publication as final rules. 92 These approaches would,
however, require significant Commission resources and could compete with other Commission
priorities.
c.

Request for Comment

1.

Should the Commission consider including automatic sunset provisions in new
disclosure requirements? If so, what types of disclosure requirements should
include these provisions? What factors should we consider in identifying them?
What would be an appropriate length of time for any sunset provisions? Would this
length of time vary with the nature of the rule in question?

2.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of automatic sunset provisions? Would
automatic sunset provisions result in unnecessary regulatory uncertainty for
investors or registrants?

91

[5 U.S.C. 610(a)].

92

Each year, since 1981, the Commission provides the public with notice that these rules are scheduled for review
and invites public comment on whether the rules should be continued without change, or should be amended or
rescinded to minimize any significant economic impact of the rules upon a substantial number of such small
entities. As a matter of policy, the Commission reviews all final rules that are published for notice and
comment to assess not only their continued compliance with the RFA, but also to assess generally their
continued utility. See, e.g., List of Rules to be Reviewed Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Release
No. 33-9965 (Oct. 22, 2015) [80 FR 65973 (Oct. 28, 2015)]. In the past, the Commission has received little or
no comment on the rules that it publishes for review.

32

3.

How would the use of automatic sunset provisions affect registrants, investors and
other users of disclosure? Would registrants, investors or other users incur
increased costs associated with the use of automatic sunset provisions?

4.

Should we consider requiring the staff to study and report to the Commission on the
impact of new disclosure requirements when adopting them, in addition to the
review the Commission performs under the RFA? For what type of disclosure
requirements would such an approach be appropriate? What are the advantages and
disadvantages of such a study and report on a new rule?

5.

Are there other ways our disclosure requirements could be revised to adapt more
easily to future market changes and technological advancements?

B.

Nature of our Disclosure Requirements

The concept of materiality has been described as “the cornerstone” of the disclosure
system established by the federal securities laws. 93 Schedule A to the Securities Act identifies
certain categories of information that are generally viewed as material to investors. 94 Those
categories are incorporated and expanded upon in the categories of information that registrants
are required to disclose under Regulation S-K.
In creating and implementing our system of integrated disclosure, identification of
material information was one of two principal objectives. In the 1982 Integrated Disclosure
Adopting Release, the Commission stated:
The Commission’s program to integrate the disclosure systems has focused on two
principal objectives: first, a comprehensive evaluation of the disclosure policies and

93

See Sommer Report at 320.

94

See id. at 324.

33

procedures under both Acts to identify the information which is material to security
holders and investors in both the distribution process and the trading markets…and,
second, a determination of the circumstances under which information should be
disseminated to security holders, investors and the marketplace. 95
The Commission adopted line-item requirements in Regulation S-K and its predecessors
to provide investors with specific disclosure within broad categories of material information. 96
Through its disclosure requirements, the Commission has adopted different approaches to guide
registrants in evaluating materiality for purposes of disclosure, including in some cases using
quantitative thresholds to address uncertainty in the application of materiality.
1.

Principles-Based and Prescriptive Disclosure Requirements

Principles-based disclosure requirements. Many of our rules require disclosure when
information is material to investors. 97 These rules rely on a registrant’s management to evaluate
95

See 1982 Integrated Disclosure Adopting Release at 11382. See also Proposed Comprehensive Revision to
System for Registration of Securities of Securities Offerings, Rel. No. 33-6235 (Sept. 2, 1980) [45 FR 63693
(Sept. 25, 1980)] (“1980 Proposed Revisions”) at 63694. This proposing release states “[t]he shape of the
[Commission’s integrated disclosure] program will be influenced by the answer to two fundamental questions:
(1) What information is material to investment decisions in the context of public offerings of securities; and (2)
Under what circumstances and in what form should such material information be disseminated and made
available by companies making public offerings of securities to the various participants in the capital market
system? The task of identifying what information is material to investment and voting decisions is a continuing
one in the field of securities regulation.”

96

See Sommer Report at 324.

97

On several occasions, the Commission has reiterated that its requirements seek disclosure of material
information. See, e.g., Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change, Release No.
33-9106 (Feb. 8, 2010) [75 FR 6290 (Feb. 8, 2010)] (“Climate Change Release”) at 6292-6293 (stating “During
the 1970s and 1980s, materiality standards for disclosure under the federal securities laws also were more fully
articulated. Those standards provide that information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a
reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding how to vote or make an investment decision, or, put
another way, if the information would alter the total mix of available information.”); Statement of the
Commission Regarding Disclosure of Year 2000 Issues and Consequences by Public Companies, Investment
Advisers, Investment Companies, and Municipal Securities Issuers, Release No. 33-7558 (Jul. 29, 1998) [63 FR
41394 (Aug. 4, 1998)] ( “Year 2000 Release”) at 41395 (stating “Our disclosure framework requires companies
to disclose material information that enables investors to make informed investment decisions.”); Timely
Disclosure of Material Corporate Events, Release No. 33-5092 (Oct. 15, 1970) [35 FR 16733 (Oct. 29, 1970)]

current] reporting requirements, it still has an obligation to make full and prompt announcements of material

34

the significance of information in the context of the registrant’s overall business and financial
circumstances and determine whether disclosure is necessary. 98 The requirements are often
referred to as “principles-based” because they articulate a disclosure objective and look to
management to exercise judgment in satisfying that objective. 99
For example, Item 303(a)(2) requires registrants to disclose material commitments for
capital expenditures, known material trends in the registrant’s capital resources, and expected
material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. 100 Similarly, Item 101(c)(1)(xi)
requires registrants to disclose the estimated amount spent during each of the last three fiscal
years on company-sponsored research and development activities, if material. 101
Prescriptive disclosure requirements. Some of our rules employ objective, quantitative
thresholds to identify when disclosure is required, or require registrants to disclose information
in all cases. These requirements are sometimes referred to as “prescriptive” or “rules-based”
because they rely on bright-line tests rather than management’s judgment to determine when
disclosure is required.
For example, disclosure requirements specific to environmental proceedings in Item 103
enumerate thresholds for disclosure based on a percentage of current assets (10%) or a specified

facts regarding the company’s financial condition… Corporate managements are urged to review their policies
with respect to corporate disclosure and endeavor to set up procedures which will insure that prompt disclosure
be made of material corporate developments…”). See also infra note 107.

See Sommer Report at 322 (“Although the initial materiality determination is management’s, this judgment is,
of course, subject to challenge or question by the Commission or in the courts.”).

dollar amount ($100,000). 102 Meeting or exceeding the applicable thresholds necessitates
disclosure. Similarly, Item 101(c)(1)(i), requires registrants to disclose for each of the last three
fiscal years the amount or percentage of total revenue contributed by any class of similar
products or services which accounted for ten percent or more of consolidated revenue in any of
the last three fiscal years or fifteen percent or more of consolidated revenue, if total revenue did
not exceed $50 million during any of such fiscal years. 103 As another example, Item 703
establishes a requirement for registrants to disclose all repurchases of equity securities by issuers
and affiliated purchasers. 104
Materiality. The concept of materiality is used throughout the federal securities laws.
The Commission has used a definition of materiality since at least 1937. Previously, the
Commission defined “material,” when used to qualify a requirement for the furnishing of
information, as “those matters as to which an average prudent investor ought reasonably to be
informed before buying or selling the security registered.” 105 In 1982, the Commission revised
Rule 12b-2, which defines “material” when used to qualify a requirement for the furnishing of
information, to adopt the Supreme Court’s definition of materiality. 106

33-6333 (August 6, 1981) [46 FR 41971 (Aug. 18, 1981)] (“1981 Proposed Revisions”). The proposing release
notes that, prior to proposing this definition, the definition of “material” was the same as adopted in 1937. This
definition provided “[t]he term ‘material’, when used to qualify a requirement for the furnishing of information
as to any subject, limits the information required to those matters as to which an average prudent investor ought
reasonably to be informed before buying or selling the security registered.” See, e.g., Adoption of Amendments
to General Rules and Regulations, Release No. 34-4194 (Dec. 17, 1948) [not published in the Federal Register]
(“1948 Adoption of Amendments to General Rules and Regulations Release”).

106

See 1982 Integrated Disclosure Adopting Release. Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act provides that the term
“material,” when used to qualify a requirement for the furnishing of information as to any subject, limits the
information required to those matters to which there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would
attach importance in determining whether to buy or sell the securities registered. [17 CFR 240.12b-2].

36

The Court has held that information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a
reasonable investor would consider the information important in deciding how to vote or make
an investment decision. 107 The Court further explained that information is material if there is a
substantial likelihood that disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the
reasonable investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of information available. 108
In proposing to revise Rule 12b-2 to adopt the Court’s definition of “material,” the
Commission noted the trend to apply the Court’s definition in every type of federal securities law
violation and concluded that the same test would be applied for any purpose under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act. 109 Although some commenters recommended retaining the current
definition or modifying the proposed one, the Commission adopted the definition as proposed
because it was based on the definition set forth by the Court. 110

In addition to the information required to be disclosed, Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires registrants to
disclose such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act [17
CFR 240.12b-20].

See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988) (“Basic” or “Basic v. Levinson”) at 231, quoting TSC
Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976) (“TSC Industries”) at 449. In TSC Industries, the
Supreme Court adopted a standard for materiality in connection with proxy statement disclosure under Schedule
14A and Rule 14a-9 of the Exchange Act. This standard was supported by the Commission. See TSC
Industries at footnote 10 (“…the SEC’s view of the proper balance between the need to insure adequate
disclosure and the need to avoid the adverse consequences of setting too low a threshold for civil liability is
entitled to consideration…The standard we adopt is supported by the SEC.”). In Basic, the Court reaffirmed
this standard of materiality and applied it in the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. Exchange Act Rule 10b5(b) prohibits any person from making an untrue statement of material fact or omitting a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in
connection with the offer or sale of any security. Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.10b-5].

108

See Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 131 U.S. 1309 (2011) (“Matrixx Initiatives”) at 1318, quoting TSC
Industries at 449. In Matrixx Initiatives, the Court applied the materiality standard, as set forth in TSC
Industries and Basic. In articulating these standards, the Supreme Court recognized that setting too low of a
materiality standard for purposes of liability could cause management to “bury shareholders in an avalanche of
trivial information.” Id. at 1318, quoting TSC Industries at 448-449.

See 1982 Integrated Disclosure Adopting Release.

From time to time, the Commission has provided guidance to assist management in the
types of assessments to make and issues to consider in determining whether information is
material. 111 For example, based on a review of MD&A disclosure to evaluate the adequacy of
disclosure practices and identify any common deficiencies, the Commission provided
interpretive guidance on assessments management should make to determine whether disclosure
of forward-looking information is required under Item 303 of Regulation S-K. 112 Similarly, in
the context of determining whether financial statements must be restated, Commission staff has
expressed the view that materiality determinations cannot be reduced to a numerical formula and
evaluations of materiality require both quantitative and qualitative considerations. 113

Comments Received

requirements or made recommendations about quantitative disclosure thresholds. 114 Two
commenters suggested that we move towards a more principles-based disclosure regime in which

consistent with TSC Industries. See footnote 6 of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Release No. SAB 99 (Aug.

simply respond to an extensive list of potentially relevant line-item disclosure requirements.” 115
Another commenter stated that it is counterintuitive to define disclosure requirements using a

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. Several commenters addressed whether disclosure
requirements should be principles-based or prescriptive. 117 The majority of these commenters
supported a principles-based system. 118 Some of these commenters suggested revising or

that the “touchstone for any disclosure requirement must be materiality as seen through the eyes
of a reasonable investor” and suggested reviewing the quantitative disclosure thresholds in Items
103 and 404 of Regulation S-K 120 to consider whether they are appropriate. 121 Another one of

Item 103 of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of material pending legal proceedings. Instruction 2 specifies
that no information need be given with respect to a proceeding that involves primarily a claim for damages if
the amount involved, exclusive of interest and costs, does not exceed ten percent of current assets of the
registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
Instruction 5 to Item 103 requires disclosure of proceedings related to federal, state, or local environmental
protection laws when (i) the proceeding is material to the registrant’s business or financial condition; (ii) the
proceeding involves primarily a claim for damages, or involves potential monetary sanctions, capital
expenditures, deferred charges or charges to income and the amount involved, exclusive of interest and costs,

these commenters suggested amending Item 10 122 of Regulation S-K to permit registrants to omit
information otherwise required by Regulation S-K if the information is not material and if the
inclusion of the information is not necessary to make any required statements not materially
misleading. 123 However, this commenter noted that this provision should not apply in all
instances. 124 This commenter also suggested revisions to some of the quantitative disclosure
thresholds in Regulation S-K to “better calibrate” such requirements 125 and recommended that
the Commission determine whether disclosure standards other than materiality should be
harmonized to “lessen ambiguity as to how these undefined disclosure standards should be
applied.” 126
Two commenters stated that a principles-based approach would provide additional
flexibility to registrants by allowing them to disclose material information based on all relevant
facts and circumstances. 127 One commenter, in lieu of creating new item requirements,

governmental authority is a party to a proceeding involving monetary sanctions, unless the registrant believes
that the proceeding will result in no monetary sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interests and
costs, of less than $100,000. [17 CFR 229.103].
Item 404 requires disclosure of transactions with related parties where the related party had or will have a direct
or indirect material interest and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 or, in the case of SRCs, where the
amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of the SRC’s total assets at year
end for the last two completed fiscal years. [17 CFR 229.404].
121

See CCMC (noting that quantitative thresholds similar to the ones in Item 103 “may not in fact be set at levels
material for all, or even most companies”).

122

Item 10 of Regulation S-K contains general requirements on the application of Regulation S-K, Commission
policies on projections and security ratings, incorporation by reference and the use of non-GAAP financial
measures in Commission filings. [17 CFR 229.10].

encouraged greater staff guidance through disclosure guidance topics or staff bulletins to provide
companies with factors to consider when making materiality determinations. 128 One commenter
stated that using materiality as a guiding principle “carries with it the recognition that what is
important to a reasonable investor may change over time.” 129 Another commenter suggested that
accounting professionals should readdress the concept of materiality and this would help reduce
the volume of unnecessary disclosure. 130
One commenter opposed a principles-based system, stating such a system could result in
inconsistent application of the principles-based threshold and thus non-comparable information
across companies. 131 This commenter also stated that the use of prescriptive disclosure
requirements does not prevent companies from including additional principles-based disclosure
if the company would like to do so. 132

Discussion

In 2003, the staff prepared a study on the adoption of a principles-based accounting
system. 133 Although it did not address disclosure requirements under Regulation S-K, many of
the study’s conclusions may be relevant to our general consideration of principles-based
disclosure standards. The study found drawbacks to establishing accounting standards on either
a rules-based or a principles-based approach. 134 The study noted that principles-only standards

may present enforcement difficulties because they are, by their nature, imprecise. 135 They can
also result in a significant loss of comparability among reporting entities. Prescriptive standards,
on the other hand, can be circumvented more easily by structuring around the bright-line
requirements of the standard. 136
In the S-K Study, the staff stated that any recommended revisions to Regulation S-K
should emphasize a principles-based approach as an overarching component of the disclosure
framework while preserving the benefits of a rules-based system, which affords consistency,
completeness and comparability across registrants. 137 In assessing this recommendation, we
recognize the merits and drawbacks of our principles-based and prescriptive disclosure
requirements.
Limiting prescriptive disclosure requirements and emphasizing principles-based
disclosure could improve disclosure by reducing the amount of information that may be
irrelevant, outdated or immaterial. Because prescriptive disclosure requirements may result in
disclosure that is not necessarily material or important to investors, greater use of principlesbased disclosure requirements may allow registrants to more effectively tailor their disclosure to
provide only the information about their specific business and financial condition that is
important to investors. A principles-based approach also may allow registrants to readily adapt
their disclosure to facts and circumstances that may change over time.
On the other hand, reducing prescriptive disclosure requirements and shifting towards
more principles-based disclosure requirements may limit the comparability, consistency and
completeness of disclosure. Also, in the absence of clear guidelines for determining when

42

information is material, registrants may have difficulty applying principles-based disclosure
requirements, 138 and the disclosure provided may not give investors sufficient insight into how
registrants apply different principles-based disclosure thresholds. Potentially important
information that may be disclosed in response to a prescriptive disclosure requirement might not
be included in response to a principles-based disclosure requirement. In the context of
accounting standards, some have noted practical challenges associated with principles-based
standards as “auditors and accountants may be less able to predict how regulators or courts will
apply these principles in particular contexts.” 139 Additionally, the use of prescriptive disclosure
requirements does not prevent registrants from including additional, principles-based disclosures
that the registrant deems important.
The Section 108 Study proposed a third alternative for developing new accounting
standards, which the staff referred to as an “objectives-oriented” approach. 140 Under this
approach, standard setters would develop new rules by clearly articulating the accounting
objective of the standard and providing sufficient detail and structure so that the standard can be
applied on a consistent basis. The staff further recommended that such standards should be
based on a consistently-applied conceptual framework, minimize exceptions and avoid the use of

Should we revise our principles-based rules to use a consistent disclosure threshold?
If so, should a materiality standard be used or should a different standard, such as
an “objectives-oriented” approach or any other approach, be used? If materiality
should be used, should the current definition be retained? Should we consider a
different definition of materiality for disclosure purposes? If so, how should it be

Do registrants find it difficult to apply principles-based requirements? Why? If
they are uncertain about whether information is to be disclosed, do registrants err on

Audience for Disclosure

The Securities Act and the Exchange Act require registrants to provide information
prescribed by the Commission as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. 142 The legislative history of the federal securities laws speaks broadly to
the “buying public,” 143 without addressing variation in the needs or sophistication of investors.
Nearly fifty years ago, the Wheat Report recognized variation among the investor
audience for disclosure and suggested that the Commission’s disclosure requirements should
strike a “pragmatic balance…between the needs of unsophisticated investors and those of the

142

knowledgeable student of finance.” 144 The Sommer Report also recognized the broad spectrum
of investors but recommended that the Commission should not expect corporate filings “to be
readily understandable in total by uninformed investors.” 145 Instead, the Sommer Report
concluded that the Commission’s rules should “emphasize disclosure of information useful to
reasonably knowledgeable investors willing to make the effort needed to study the disclosures,
leaving to disseminators the development of simplified formats and summaries usable by less
experienced and less knowledgeable investors.” 146
When adopting format and content changes to Form 10-K and the annual report to
security holders as part of integrated disclosure, the Commission characterized users of Form
10-K as different from users of the annual report to security holders. 147 Specifically, the
Commission viewed annual reports to shareholders as readable documents designed to be
delivered to shareholders 148 and stated that the disclosure requirements in these reports “evolved

for “investors and other users making economic decisions about the company.” 151 The
Commission further noted that the most frequent users of Form 10-K disclosure were
institutional investors, professional security analysts and sophisticated individual investors.
In the adopting release for these changes, the Commission stated its belief that focusing
primarily on these frequent users is appropriate in formulating Form 10-K disclosure
requirements, but “such a focus would not be appropriate in formulating requirements for annual
reports to security holders.” 152 While the Commission acknowledged the benefit of uniformity
of certain minimum disclosures in the annual report to security holders and the Form 10-K, it
stated that not all disclosure requirements would be identical between the Form 10-K and the
annual report to security holders, which potentially served different purposes and user
constituencies.

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. Two commenters discussed the profile of the investor
contemplated by our disclosure requirements and the intended audience for public company
disclosures. 154 Both commenters recommended that we should assume that investors using
registrants’ disclosures have some level of sophistication. One of these commenters suggested
that a contributing factor to increased disclosure is the current assumption that the typical
investor is a novice. 155 The other commenter recommended an empirical study of the audience
for financial statements and a review of who makes investment decisions and how such decisions
are made. 156 This commenter stated that sophisticated investors are likely the most appropriate
audience for Commission filings, as they are generally the investors performing detailed analysis
and acting as price-makers. This commenter also stated that most of these investors do not
express concern about the volume of disclosure.
One commenter suggested that current disclosure is too complicated for the everyday
person to read and that it should be less duplicative and more straightforward. 157 Another
commenter noted the diversity of the investor community and that the Commission’s mandate is

circumstances, disclosure should still be required. This commenter also stated that each segment

Additionally, this commenter noted that broad based disclosure improves transparency and
builds public trust, confidence and understanding of capital markets.

Discussion

We recognize the diverse composition and varied informational needs, sophistication
and financial resources of investors and that some investors may obtain their analysis or advice
from or through third parties who use registrant disclosures. Investors using registrant
disclosure directly may include both individual investors and institutional investors, such as
banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, pension funds, hedge funds
and managed accounts. These investor types may also use registrant disclosure indirectly
through professional data aggregators, financial advisors, proxy advisors, professional analysts,
journalists, and other third parties who process and synthesize disclosures for end user investors.
Different investor types and third parties may focus on different filings or items of
disclosure. 159 Accordingly, the audience for disclosure is an important consideration in
determining the means for disclosure, and specifically, in which filings or locations certain

1128-1161 (2015) (documenting that, of the 9.8 million users who directly searched the EDGAR database from
2008 to 2011, 86% are infrequent users accessing the database less than three times a quarter and generally
accessing only one filing, although there is a small percentage of users accessing EDGAR at least every other
trading day).

information should be directly provided and where cross-references, hyperlinks or incorporating
by reference to information elsewhere is appropriate. 160
Similarly, as different investors and third parties use disclosure in different ways and
seek varying degrees of information, the audience for disclosure is also an important
consideration in determining what information is disclosed. Institutional investors, their
financial advisors and some third parties often use, and have supported requiring complex
information and interactive data. 161 These types of investors are likely to use disclosures of
large numbers of registrants and therefore, may be relatively more interested in standardized
disclosure formats well-suited for large-scale processing and analysis, including machinereadable formats.
Other investors may seek disclosure that emphasizes, within the universe of information
that is disclosed, the information and analysis that management believes is most important. 162
To the extent some investors rely on market prices to efficiently incorporate all public
information, rather than relying on disclosures directly, it could be argued that disclosures
should be tailored to those users most likely to actively follow a registrant, transact in the
registrant’s securities and set the market price. 163 Investors in registrants that do not have a

163

The efficient market theory suggests that under certain assumptions, most investors, when making investment
decisions, could rely on market prices to incorporate all available information. According to this theory, most
investors would not need to individually examine much of the information in disclosures. See, e.g., Stephen J.
Choi, Company Registration: Towards a Status-Based Antifraud Regime, 64 U. Chi. L. Rev. 567, 569-70
(1997); Eugene F. Fama, Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, 25 J. Fin. 383,

Compliance and Competitive Costs

When the Commission is engaged in rulemaking it is statutorily required to consider, in
addition to the protection of investors, whether an action will promote efficiency, competition,
and capital formation. 166 Disclosure requirements can help reduce information asymmetries
from management to investors, 167 improving the allocative efficiency of the capital markets and
enhancing capital formation by lowering the cost of capital. 168 Lack of information may affect

See Robert Verrecchia, Essays on Disclosure, 32 J. Acct. Econ. 91, 91–180 (2001) (demonstrating that a

investors or among investors).

investors’ willingness to invest and may decrease the allocative efficiency of the capital
markets. Thus, requiring an appropriate level of disclosure is critical to a well-functioning
capital market.
Disclosure may also have costs to registrants that could negatively affect these factors,
although advances in technology and communications have the potential to reduce these costs.
As disclosure costs rise, registrants’ costs of capital may increase, which can reduce investment,
lower the value of a company and impede economic growth. Registrants may also choose to
exit the Commission’s reporting system, when eligible, or remain private if the disclosure
requirements are sufficiently costly. 169

Discussion

We are sensitive to the costs of disclosure, including the administrative and compliance
costs of preparing and disseminating disclosure as well as the potential costs of disclosing
sensitive information to competitors. While the S-K Study did not specifically consider costs to
investors, the staff identified economic principles that should be given consideration when
reviewing and considering changes to our disclosure requirements, including: (1) the extent to
which a given disclosure requirement entails high administrative and compliance costs; and (2)
the extent to which disclosure of a company’s proprietary information may have competitive or
other economic costs. 176

To address the potential negative effects that would result from disclosing sensitive
information, our rules permit registrants to request confidential treatment of proprietary
information, if disclosure of such information would cause competitive harm to the registrant. 177
The Commission generally does not consider confidential treatment to be appropriate for
information that is necessary for the protection of investors. 178 If the Commission grants a
request for confidential treatment, the registrant may redact the proprietary information from its
public filings.
The Commission also has addressed the costs of disclosure through regulatory relief in the
form of scaled disclosure requirements for certain smaller registrants. These accommodations are
intended to promote capital formation and provide relief where the fixed costs of compliance
may be particularly high relative to the size of the company while also considering investor
protection. 179

Securities Act Rule 406(b)(2)(iii) [17 CFR 230.406(b)(2)(iii)]. The staff has provided guidance that, except in
unusual circumstances, disclosure required by Regulation S-K or any other applicable disclosure requirement is
not an appropriate subject for confidential treatment. See Staff Legal Bulletin 1A, Confidential Treatment

Throughout this concept release, we seek comment on changes to specific disclosure
requirements that could reduce costs for registrants, while still providing investors with
information that is important or useful to making informed investment and voting decisions.
Separately, we address the effectiveness of our scaled disclosure requirements. 180 In addition to
those discussions, we are interested in public comment on other methods we could consider to
reduce costs for registrants that would not compromise investors’ access to important
information.
c.

Request for Comment

21.

Do current disclosure requirements appropriately consider the costs and benefits of
disclosure to registrants and investors? How should the Commission evaluate
benefits, such as those arising from disclosure, that cannot be easily quantified?

22. In addition to scaled disclosure and confidential treatment, are there other
accommodations that we could make to reduce costs for registrants while still
providing investors with the information that is important or useful to making
informed investment and voting decisions?
23.

Are there other benefits and costs that we should consider when evaluating
disclosure effectiveness?

IV.

Information for Investment and Voting Decisions
A.

Core Company Business Information

Disclosure about a registrant’s business lays the groundwork for understanding and
assessing a company, its operations and financial condition. Information about a registrant’s
industry, business environment and other factors affecting the business helps inform investment
180

For a discussion of our scaled disclosure requirements, see Section IV.H.

and voting decisions by placing other disclosure in context. Schedule A of the Securities Act
requires disclosure of the general character of the business transacted or to be transacted by the
registrant. Item 101 of Regulation S-K similarly requires a description of a registrant’s business.
Item 102 requires disclosure about a registrant’s materially important physical properties. We
are reviewing the disclosure required by Item 101(a)(1) and (c) 181 and Item 102 of Regulation SK to determine whether they continue to provide investors with the information they need to
understand the nature of a registrant’s business and properties. We are seeking public input on
whether there are any disclosure requirements that should be eliminated or modified and whether
we should add any new disclosure requirements to these Items.
1.

General Development of Business (Item 101(a)(1))

Item 101(a) of Regulation S-K requires a description of the general development of the
business of the registrant during the past five years, or such shorter period as the registrant may
have been engaged in business. 182 In describing the general development of the business, Item
101(a)(1) requires disclosure such as the following: the year in which the registrant was
organized and its form of organization; the nature and results of any bankruptcy, receivership or
similar proceedings with respect to the registrant or any of its significant subsidiaries; the nature
and results of any other material reclassification, merger or consolidation of the registrant or any
of its significant subsidiaries; the acquisition or disposition of any material amount of assets
otherwise than in the ordinary course of business; and any material changes in the mode of
conducting the business.
181

The staff is separately considering certain aspects of Item 101 in developing recommendations for potential
changes to update or simplify certain disclosure requirements. For a description of this project, see supra
Section I.

182

17 CFR 229.101(a)(1). Item 101(a)(1) states information shall be disclosed for earlier periods if material to an
understanding of the general development of the business.

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter, as part of a general recommendation
to limit disclosure requirements asking for the same or very similar information on multiple
occasions, noted redundancies between current reports on Form 8-K and annual reports on Form
10-K and recommended that redundant disclosure in reports subsequent to disclosure in a Form
8-K should not be required. 183 For example, and as noted by this commenter, Items 1.03
(Bankruptcy or Receivership) and 2.01 (Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets) of
Form 8-K require disclosure similar to the disclosure required under Item 101(a)(1). This
commenter also recommended making a distinction under Item 101(a)(1) for new registrants,
which may be disclosing the general development of their business for the first time in a
registration statement, and established reporting registrants, which would have disclosed such
information in a previous filing.
b.

Discussion

A requirement to provide a brief outline of the general development of the business for
the preceding five years was included in the earliest forms of registration statements and annual
reports. 184 The first version of Regulation S-K adopted in 1977 included Item 101(a)(1) as part

183

See CCMC (also noting redundancies between Item 4.01 of Form 8-K (Changes in Registrant’s Certifying
Accountant) and Item 304 of Regulation S-K (disclosure of changes in and disagreements with accountants) and
Item 3.02 of Form 8-K (Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities) and Item 701 of Regulation S-K (disclosure of
recent sales of unregistered securities)).

184

See, e.g., Item 6 of Form A-2 adopted in 1935, which required registrants to outline briefly “the general
development of the business for the preceding five years.” See Release No. 33-276 (Jan. 14, 1935) [not
published in the Federal Register]. Additionally, Item 5 of Form A-1, adopted in 1933, required registrants to
briefly describe the length of time the registrant had been engaged in its business. See Release No. 33-5 (July 6,
1933) [not published in the Federal Register]. See also S-K Study at 32, footnote 88.

of the description of business disclosure requirements. 185 At that time, the Commission amended
Item 101(c) to delete a requirement to discuss specific business changes during the past three
fiscal years noting “[a]ny material changes would be described pursuant to paragraph (a) of the
item.” 186
Business developments and other disclosure called for by Item 101(a)(1) are often
reflected elsewhere in the filing, such as in the financial statements or MD&A. Additionally, in
2004, the Commission expanded the number of reportable events on Form 8-K to include items
that may result in disclosure that overlaps with the requirements of Item 101(a)(1), such as
disclosure of entry into a material definitive agreement, including business combination
agreements. 187
c.

Request for Comment

24.

Does the current requirement in Item 101(a)(1) to describe the general development
of a registrant’s business during the past five years provide useful disclosure that is
not available either elsewhere in the current filing (e.g., MD&A or the notes to the
financial statements) or in any prior filing, including current reports on Form 8-K?
Should we require additional or more specific information under Item 101(a)(1)
and, if so, what type of information and why?

How could we improve Item 101(a)(1)? For example, is the five-year time frame
for this disclosure appropriate? Would a shorter or longer time frame be more
appropriate? If so, what time frame would be appropriate and why?

26.

Does this disclosure continue to be useful for registrants with a reporting history?
Once a registrant has disclosed this information in a registration statement should
we allow registrants to omit this disclosure from subsequent periodic reports unless
material changes occur? Alternatively, should we require registrants to describe its
business as currently conducted as well as any material changes that have occurred
in the last five years?

27.

Should we revise Item 101(a)(1) to require disclosure of a registrant’s business
strategy? Would investors find such a disclosure important or useful? If so, should
this requirement be included in a registrant’s MD&A? Should we define “business
strategy”? If so, how?

28.

Should we permit a summary disclosure of the general development of a
registrant’s business in all filings except the initial filing? For example, should we
require a more detailed discussion of a registrant’s business in the initial filing, and
in subsequent filings only require a summary of the registrant’s business along with
a discussion of material changes in the business as previously disclosed in the
registrant’s Form 10-K? Alternatively, should we require a more detailed
discussion of a registrant’s business on a periodic basis, such as every three years,
and a summary disclosure in other years? Should any such requirement be
conditioned on timely reporting or some other consideration?

What types of investors or audiences are most likely to value the information
required by Item 101(a)(1)?

What is the cost of providing the disclosure required by Item 101(a), including the
administrative and compliance costs of preparing and disseminating this
disclosure? How would these costs change if we made any of the changes
contemplated here? Please provide quantified estimates where possible and include
only those costs associated with providing disclosure under Item 101(a).

2.

Narrative Description of Business (Item 101(c))

While Item 101(a) requires disclosure of the general development of the business, Item
101(c) requires a narrative description of a registrant’s business and identifies thirteen specific
items that must be disclosed: 188
(i)

principal products produced and services rendered;

(ii)

new products or segments;

(iii) sources and availability of raw materials;
(iv) intellectual property;
(v)

seasonality of the business;

(vi) working capital practices;
(vii) dependence on certain customers;
(viii) dollar amount of backlog orders believed to be firm;
(ix) business subject to renegotiation or termination of government contracts;

188

17 CFR 229.101(c). Item 101(c)(1) specifies that, to the extent material to an understanding of the registrant’s
business taken as a whole, the description of each segment must include the information specified in
subsections (i) through (x). Information in subsections (xi) to (xiii) is required to be discussed for the
registrant’s business in general; where material, the segments to which these matters are significant also must be
identified.

61

(x)

competitive conditions;

(xi) company-sponsored research and development activities;
(xii) compliance with environmental laws; and
(xiii) number of employees.

Comments Received

S-K Study. Two commenters recommended eliminating the requirement in Item 101(c) to
disclose the amount of backlog orders believed to be firm for EGCs, stating the concept of
backlog is not a “meaningful metric” for most of these companies. 189 These commenters stated
that eliminating this requirement for EGCs would not “compromise the delivery of meaningful
disclosure to investors.” These commenters also raised the question of whether the concept of
backlog (or for businesses other than industrials, some other measure of committed revenue that
is not yet reflected in the financial statements) would be addressed more appropriately in
MD&A. Another commenter recommended eliminating disclosure requirements that no longer
apply due to market or other changes and noted backlog as an example. 190 This commenter
recommended eliminating this requirement for all registrants, not only EGCs, or moving this
requirement to MD&A.

of Item 101(c) would be more appropriately addressed elsewhere in the filing, stating that when

indication of the portion thereof not reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year, and seasonal
or other material aspects of the backlog.

such information is material to a registrant, investors would be better served by having the
registrant address that information in its MD&A or risk factors. 191
b.

Discussion

Consistent with Schedule A of the Securities Act, the earliest forms of registration
statements and annual reports required a brief outline of the general character of the business
done and intended to be done by a registrant. 192 Many of the disclosure requirements that
currently appear in Item 101(c) were adopted in 1973 following investigation of the hot issues
markets. 193 The adopting release notes that, in making investment decisions, venture capitalists
and underwriters typically obtain specific information from companies about their competitive
position and the methods of competition in their respective industries, and accordingly, the new
requirements were expected to provide similar information to the investing public. 194 At the
same time, the Commission also added requirements for the disclosure of the amount of backlog
orders, the sources and availability of raw materials essential to the business, the number of
employees and working capital practices. 195

191

See SCSGP (stating that the following subsections of Item 101 would be more useful if included in MD&A:
backlog ((c)(1)(viii)), working capital practices ((c)(1)(vi)), sources and availability of raw materials
((c)(1)(iii)), dependence on certain customers ((c)(1)(vii)), competitive conditions ((c)(1)(x)), compliance with
environmental laws ((c)(1)(xii)) and risks attendant to foreign operations ((d)(3))).

192

See, e.g., Item 5 of Form A-2 adopted in 1935, which required registrants to outline briefly “the general
character of the business done and intended to be done by the registrant and its subsidiaries.” See Release No.
33-276 (Jan. 14, 1935) [not published in the Federal Register]. Additionally, Items 3 through 5 of Form A-1,
adopted in 1933, required registrants to briefly describe the “character of business done or intended to be done,”
disclose a list of states where the issuer owned property and was qualified to do business, and the length of time
the registrant had been engaged in its business. See Release No. 33-5 (July 6, 1933) [not published in the
Federal Register]. See also S-K Study at 32, footnote 88.

In the S-K Study, the staff recommended reviewing the description of business for
continuing relevance in light of changes that have occurred in the way businesses operate, which
may make other disclosures relevant that are not expressly addressed under current
requirements. 196 As an example, the S-K Study noted that requirements could be more specific
as to additional disclosure that would be necessary where a business relies heavily on intellectual
property owned by a third party or relies on a service agreement with third parties to perform
necessary business functions. 197

Request for Comment

31.

Do the disclosure requirements in Item 101(c) continue to provide useful
information to investors? How could we improve Item 101(c)’s requirements?

32.

How could we update Item 101(c) to better reflect changes in the way businesses
operate? Are there particular categories or types of registrants for which these
disclosure requirements are more or less relevant?

33.

Are there additional line-item disclosure requirements about a registrant’s business
that would improve the quality and consistency of disclosure? Are there any
categories of information that certain registrants voluntarily provide, and are not
required to disclose under Item 101(c), that we should include in Item 101(c)? 198
What would be the benefits and challenges of requiring disclosure of additional
categories of information?

196

See S-K Study at 99-100.

197

Below, and in other parts of this release, we discuss other areas where our requirements could be revised to
reflect changes in the way businesses operate.

198

For example, the staff has observed that many registrants provide disclosure about the regulatory environment
in which their business operates although no specific line-item disclosure requirement for this exists.

64

34.

Currently, some registrants include in their business section a general description of
their industry. Should industry disclosure be a separate requirement? If so, would
this requirement be more useful to investors in the business section or in MD&A?

35.

Should we require additional specific disclosure relevant to particular industries,
such as manufacturing or technology companies? If so, which industries and why?
What are the benefits and challenges of requiring industry-specific disclosure? 199

36.

What is the impact on disclosure of listing the thirteen item requirements in Item
101(c)? In practice, do registrants view Item 101(c) as a checklist? Do the
prescriptive items result in disclosure of information that is not important by some
registrants?

37.

Should we require Item 101(c) disclosure only in the initial filing with follow-up
disclosure of any material changes for subsequent years? Should any such
requirement be conditioned on timely reporting or some other consideration?
Should the requirements differ for registration statements and periodic reports?

38.

Is there any information currently disclosed in the description of business that
should be presented in a different context such as MD&A or risk factors? Why?

39.

In some circumstances, disclosure is required under Item 101(c)(1) if material. The
item specifies that, to the extent material to an understanding of the registrant’s
business taken as a whole, the description of each segment shall include the
information in (c)(1)(i) through (x) and that matters in (c)(1)(xi) through (xiii) shall
be discussed for the registrant’s business in general; where material, the segments to
which these matters are significant shall be identified. Additionally, some sub-

65

items of Item 101(c)(1) require disclosure if material, such as (c)(1)(ii) and
(c)(1)(ix), 200 while others do not. 201 Should we require disclosure of all line items
in Item 101(c) in all circumstances, regardless of materiality? Why or why not?
Alternatively, would a principles-based approach to disclosure about a registrant’s
business and operations allow flexibility to disclose information that is important to
investors? If so, how should such a disclosure requirement be structured? What
factors should we consider in developing such a requirement?
40.

What types of investors or audiences are most likely to value the information
required by Item 101(c)? Would an alternative format or presentation of the
information improve the value of such disclosure to a particular type of investor or
audience? If so, what type of format or presentation?

41.

What is the cost of providing the disclosure required by Item 101(c), including the
administrative and compliance costs of preparing and disseminating this
disclosure? How would these costs change if we made any of the changes
contemplated here? Please provide quantified estimates where possible and include
only those costs associated with providing disclosure under Item 101(c).

200

For example, Item 101(c)(1)(ii) requires a description of the status of a product or segment (e.g., whether in the
planning stage, whether prototypes exist, the degree to which product design has progressed or whether further
engineering is necessary), if there has been a public announcement of, or if the registrant otherwise has made
public information about, a new product or segment that would require the investment of a material amount of
the assets of the registrant or that otherwise is material. In addition, Item 101(c)(1)(ix) requires a description of
any material portion of the business that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or
subcontracts at the election of the Government.

201

For example, Item 101(c)(1)(xiii) requires disclosure of the number of persons employed by the registrant.

Technology and Intellectual Property Rights (Item 101(c)(1)(iv))

Item 101(c)(1)(iv) requires disclosure of the importance to the segment and the duration
and effect of all patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions held. 202

Discussion

A broad range of industries benefit from intellectual property, both directly and
indirectly, 203 and intellectual property has become increasingly important to business
performance. 204 Certain industries produce or use significant amounts of intellectual property or
rely more heavily on these rights. 205 Accordingly, certain registrants provide detailed disclosure
in response to Item 101(c)(1)(iv), and disclosure varies among registrants and across industries.
In the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, registrants that provide detailed
patent disclosure often disclose the jurisdiction in which the patent was filed, year of expiration,
type of patent (e.g., composition of matter, method of use, method of delivery or method of

202

17 CFR 229.101(c)(1)(iv).

Property and the U.S. Economy: Industries in Focus (March 2012) at iv, available at

and the U.S. Economy”).

technology firms?, Int. J. Intellectual Property Management, Vol. 6, No. 4 (2013).

205

See Intellectual Property and the U.S. Economy. This report identifies seventy-five industries as “IP-intensive.”
In this report, patents, trademarks and copyrights were the categories of intellectual property assessed. The
methodology for designating each of these subcategories as “IP-intensive” is outlined further in this report. For
patent intensive industries, the report utilized the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
codes and identified, as the four most patent-intensive industries, those industries classified in computer and
electronic product manufacturing (NAICS 334). This three-digit NAICS industry includes computer and
peripheral equipment; communications equipment; other computer and electronic products; semiconductor and
other electronic components; and navigational, measuring, electro-medical, and control instruments.

67

manufacturing), products or technologies to which the patent relates and how the patent was
acquired (e.g., licensed from another entity or owned and filed by the registrant). Some
registrants in these industries aggregate patent disclosure by groups of patents, potentially
making disclosure about individual material patents difficult to discern. As registrants in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries regularly sell one or a few patented products that
generate substantial revenue, disclosure of “patent cliffs,” 206 which often result in material
adverse financial effects, may be required in the risk factors section or MD&A.
In the information technologies and services industry, registrants protect their intellectual
property through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and
confidentiality agreements. 207 Registrants with large portfolios of intellectual property often
disclose that their products, services and technologies are not dependent on any specific patent,
trademark, copyright, trade secret or license. As a result, these registrants often provide only
high-level discussions of their intellectual property portfolios, which include general statements
of a registrant’s development, use and protection of its intellectual property. Registrants with
smaller intellectual property portfolios tend to provide slightly more detailed discussions,
including, for example, disclosure of their total number of issued patents, a range of years during
which those patents expire and their total number of pending patent applications.

206

The term “patent cliff” as used in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry refers to a future loss of patent
protection and consequential loss of revenue. These potential future losses are known to registrants far in
advance of their onset. When they occur, they often precipitate material adverse financial effects. See, e.g.,
Andrew Jack, Pharma tries to avoid falling off ‘patent cliff,’ Financial Times, May 6, 2012 and Cliffhanger,
Economist, Dec. 3, 2011. See also Ed Silverman, Big Pharma Faces Some Big Patent Losses, but Pipelines are
Improving, Wall St. J.: L. Blog, available at http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/02/09/big-pharma-facessome-big-patent-losses-but-pipelines-are-improving/.

See Bruce Abramson, Promoting Innovation in the Software Industry: A First Principles Approach to
Intellectual Property Reform, 8 B.U. J. Sci. & Tech. L. 75 (2002) (discussing the software industry’s use of
intellectual property law).

68

In general, registrants in the information technologies and services industry use
copyrights to protect against the unauthorized copying of software programs 208 and trade secrets
to protect proprietary and confidential information that derives its value from continued
secrecy. 209 Since Item 101(c)(1)(iv) does not require disclosure about copyrights or trade
secrets, registrants currently make disclosure about such matters voluntarily.

Request for Comment

42.

Should we retain the current scope of Item 101(c)(1)(iv), which requires disclosure
of a registrant’s patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions? Should
we expand the rule to include other types of intellectual property, such as
copyrights? Should we remove the individual categories and instead require
disclosure of “intellectual property”? If so, should we define that term and what
should it encompass?

43.

What, if any, additional information about a registrant’s reliance on or use of
technology and related intellectual property rights should we require and why?
Should we revise Item 101(c)(1)(iv) to require more detailed intellectual property
disclosure, similar to the disclosure currently provided by some biotechnology and
pharmaceutical registrants? If so, should we require such detailed disclosures for
all or only some of a registrant’s intellectual property, such as those that are
material to the business?

44.

For registrants with large intellectual property portfolios, does aggregate disclosure
of the total number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and a range of expiration
dates provide investors with sufficient information? If not, what additional
information do investors need about a company’s portfolio of intellectual property?
Would tabular disclosure or an alternate format or presentation of a registrant’s
intellectual property portfolio make the information more useful to investors? What
would be the benefits and challenges of requiring disclosure of this information in
this format?

45.

Should we limit these disclosure requirements to registrants in particular industries?
If so, which industries should we specify and why? Is disclosure about a
registrant’s intellectual property most useful in the context of the description of
business, disclosure about trends and developments affecting results of operations,
or in a discussion of risk and risk management?

46.

What are the competitive costs of disclosure under Item 101(c)(1)(iv)?

Government Contracts and Regulation, including Environmental Laws (Items
101(c)(1)(ix) and (c)(1)(xii))

Item 101(c)(1)(ix) requires disclosure of any material portion of a business that may be
subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the
government. 210 Item 101(c)(1)(xii) requires disclosure of the material effects of compliance with
environmental laws on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the
registrant and its subsidiaries, as well as any material estimated capital expenditures for the
remainder of the fiscal year, the succeeding fiscal year, and such future periods that the registrant

See ABA 2.
U.S. government contracts generally contain provisions that enable the contract to be terminated, in whole or in
part, without prior notice, at the government’s convenience (due to lack of funding or for other reasons) or for
default based on performance. ASC 912-275-50-1 requires footnote disclosure of renegotiation uncertainties,
their significance, and renegotiation discussions relating to the current year. In addition, ASC 912-275-50-6
states that if there are indications that a contract termination may occur and the termination would have a
material effect on the contractor’s operations, disclosure of the circumstances and the potential effects shall be
made in the notes to financial statements. The staff has observed that, rather than provide duplicative
disclosure, some government contractors cross-reference their discussion of the government’s right to terminate
a contract under Item 101(c)(1)(ix) to either their accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition in the
critical accounting estimates disclosure in MD&A or to their significant accounting policies in the notes to the
financial statements.

Government Contracts (Item 101(c)(1)(ix))

i.

Discussion

Business contracts with agencies of the U.S. government and the various laws and
regulations relating to procurement and performance of U.S. government contracts impose terms
and rights that are different from those typically found in commercial contracts. In a 1972
Notice to Registrants, the Commission noted that government contracts are subject to
renegotiation of profit and to termination for the convenience of the government. 216 At any
given time in the performance of a government contract, an estimate of its profitability is often
subject not only to additional costs to be incurred but also to the outcome of future negotiations
or possible claims relating to costs already incurred. 217
Registrants with U.S. government contracts tend to disclose that the funding of these
contracts is subject to the availability of Congressional appropriations and that, as a result, longterm government contracts are partially funded initially with additional funds committed only as
Congress makes further appropriations. These registrants disclose that they may be required to
maintain security clearances for facilities and personnel in order to protect classified information.
Additionally, these registrants state that they may be subject to routine government audits and
investigations, and any deficiencies or illegal activities identified during the audits or

any additional information about a registrant’s contracts with the government that
would be important to investors?

Compliance with Environmental Laws (Item 101(c)(1)(xii))

i.

Discussion

Pursuant to NEPA, which mandated consideration of the environment in regulatory
action, the Commission adopted Item 101(c)(1)(xii) in 1973 to require disclosure of the material
effects compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws may have on the capital
expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the registrant. 218 Subsequent litigation
concerning both the denial of a rulemaking petition and adoption of the 1973 environmental
disclosure requirements resulted in the Commission initiating public proceedings in 1975
primarily to elicit comments on whether the provisions of NEPA required further rulemaking. 219
As a result of these proceedings, the Commission in 1976 amended the requirements to
specifically require disclosure of any material estimated capital expenditures for environmental

Should we increase or reduce the environmental disclosure required by Item
101(c)(1)(xii)? Why? What kind of information should we add to or remove from
this requirement?

50.

Is disclosure about the material effects that compliance with provisions regulating
the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment, may have upon a registrant’s capital expenditures,
earnings and competitive position important to investors? If so, should we require
registrants to present this disclosure in a specific format? Would this disclosure be
more appropriate in MD&A or the business section?

51.

Should we require specific disclosure about the material effects that other
regulations may have on a registrant’s capital expenditures, earnings and
competitive position? If so, are there specific laws and regulations that our rules
should cover?

Government Regulation

i.

Discussion

Although not referenced in Item 101, many registrants discuss government regulations
relevant to their business. 221 Healthcare and insurance providers regularly disclose the

220

See 1976 Environmental Release.

221

However, the disclosure requirements applicable to SRCs do require some of this information, to the extent
material. Item 101(h)(4)(viii) requires disclosure of the need for any government approval of principal products
or services. If government approval is necessary and the SRC has not yet received that approval, SRCs are
required to discuss the status of the approval within the government approval process. The staff has observed

74

registrant’s collection, use and protection of individually-identifiable information and its
compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 222 as well as
the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 223 on its business. Biotechnology
or medical device companies often disclose the status of and process for FDA approval of
significant new drugs or medical devices. Public utilities typically discuss regulation by various
federal, state and local authorities and include information about state ratemaking procedures,
which determine the rates utilities charge and the return on invested capital they earn.
Registrants in the financial services industry regularly describe federal and state
regulation as well as supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, while registrants with a material
amount of U.S. government contracts disclose the laws and regulations for government contracts.
Registrants with tax strategies involving foreign jurisdictions typically disclose that they are
subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and that future
changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax law could adversely affect their anticipated financial position
and results. Some disclose the impact on their business of tax treaties between the U.S. and one
or more foreign jurisdictions.
ii.

Request for Comment

52. Given that many registrants provide disclosure of material government regulations
without a specific line-item requirement, are the current disclosure requirements
sufficient? Would a specific requirement seeking this disclosure provide additional
information that is important to investors? If so, what specific information and
that biotechnology or medical device companies that are not SRCs also provide this disclosure. Additionally,
Item 101(h)(4)(ix) requires disclosure of the effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the
business. For a discussion of scaled disclosure requirements, see Section IV.H.2.

for registrants to provide such disclosure?

Number of Employees (Item 101(c)(1)(xiii))

Item 101(c)(1)(xiii) requires disclosure of the number of persons employed by the
registrant. The Division of Corporation Finance (“Division”) has provided interpretive guidance
on this requirement stating that, in industries where the general practice is to hire independent
contractors rather than employees, companies should disclose the number of persons retained as
independent contractors as well as the number of regular employees. 224

would signal to investors the use of a particularly aggressive and potentially risky strategy to
hide profits from regulators.”
b.

Discussion

The number of persons employed by the registrant can help investors assess the size and
scale of a registrant’s operations. Changes in the number or type of persons employed can also
be indicative of trends or shifts in a registrant’s operations. Disclosure of the number of
employees varies among registrants. Some registrants distinguish between the number of fulltime and part-time employees, and others specify the number of employees in each department
or division. Registrants with large numbers of employees often disclose the approximate number
of employees and discuss their employees’ membership in a union or similar organization. Other
registrants characterize the state of their employee relations and disclose whether their
employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
c.

Request for Comment

54.

Does disclosure of the number of persons employed by the registrant help investors
assess the size, scale and viability of a registrant’s operations and any trends or
shifts in operations? Is this disclosure important to investors and why? Is there any
additional information about employees that would be important to investors? If so,
what information?

55.

For new registrants filing a registration statement that have not had revenue from
operations during each of the preceding three fiscal years, Item 101(a)(2)(iii)
requires disclosure of any anticipated material changes in the number of employees
in the various departments such as research and development, production, sales or

77

administration. 226 Is this information useful to investors? Should we include a
similar requirement for all registrants in periodic and current reports? Should this
requirement be in addition to or in lieu of the current requirement to disclose the
number of employees?
56.

Should we require registrants to distinguish among their total number of persons
employed, such as by distinguishing between:
•

full-time and part-time or seasonal employees;

•

employees and independent contractors; or

•

domestic and foreign employees?

Why or why not?
57.

Rather than requiring registrants to disclose the number of employees or
independent contractors, should we require or permit registrants to provide a range?
Why? Should we allow for different ranges based on the size of the registrant?
Would reporting a range rather than a specific number reduce the costs of producing
this disclosure?

58.

Should we require disclosure of additional information about a registrant’s
employees or employment practices? What would be the challenges of requiring
disclosure of any additional information, and what would be the benefits to
investors?

226

Item 101(a)(2) applies to registrants filing a registration statement on Form S-1 or Form 10 that are not subject
to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and have not received revenue from operations during each of
the three fiscal years immediately before the filing of such registration statement.

As outsourcing and subcontracting have become more prevalent in the last few
decades, 227 what, if any, additional information about a registrant’s outsourcing or
subcontracting arrangements should we require? Would this information be most
useful in the context of the description of the registrant’s business, disclosure about
trends and developments affecting results of operations, or in a discussion of risk
and risk management? What would be the challenges of requiring disclosure of this
information?

Description of Property (Item 102)

Item 102 of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of the location and general character of
the principal plants, mines and other materially important physical properties of the registrant
and its subsidiaries. Item 102 also requires registrants to identify the segments, as reported in the
financial statements, that use the properties described. Instruction 1 states that registrants must
disclose such information as reasonably will inform investors as to the suitability, adequacy,
productive capacity and extent of utilization of the facilities by the registrant. 228 Instruction 2
provides that, in determining whether properties should be described, registrants should take into
account both quantitative and qualitative factors. 229
227

See, e.g., Deloitte, Deloitte’s 2014 Global Outsourcing and Insourcing Survey (2014), available at

One commenter recommended eliminating Item 102 disclosure, stating that disclosure of
physical properties does not, in most cases, provide investors meaningful information,

against disclosing only material properties and eliminating requirements to list locations,
capacity and ownership. 233 This commenter stated that investors need a complete understanding
of the scope of a registrant’s operations and assets in order to evaluate the scope of its risks and
opportunities. One commenter noted different triggers for disclosure in Item 102 such as the
item’s reference to “materially” important physical properties and “major” encumbrance. This
commenter recommended a Commission study to determine whether these varied formulations
should be harmonized to lessen ambiguity on their application. 234

Discussion

Since 1935, we have required disclosure similar to that required under Item 102. 235 The
predecessor to Item 102 called for a brief description of the general character and location of
“principal plants and other important units” of the registrant and its subsidiaries and, for property
not held in fee, a description of how the property was held. 236 In 1977, a similar requirement
was one of two original requirements in Regulation S-K and additionally, required registrants to
identify the segments that use the properties described. 237
In 1996, the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification recommended the Commission
revise Item 102 to more effectively elicit disclosure of material facts about a registrant’s
principal properties, rather than lists of properties and their immaterial characteristics. 238 The SK Study recommended reviewing Item 102 for continuing relevance given that many businesses
no longer require or depend on physical locations. 239 For businesses that do have material
properties, the S-K Study suggested refocusing disclosure on the significance of the property to
the business and any trends or uncertainties in connection with that property, rather than
requiring a list of locations, capacity and ownership. 240
In response to Item 102, registrants typically disclose information about their
headquarters such as the location, size and whether they own or lease the property, as well as
information about other properties material to the business. In addition to this disclosure, some

registrants cross-reference to the discussion in the notes to the financial statements such as to the
note on purchase and lease commitments or to the note on property, plant and equipment.
Registrants in certain industries may provide more specific disclosures. For example,
registrants with retail stores often disclose the number of their stores, location, size and lease
termination dates. Registrants in the hotel and lodging industry tend to disclose the location and
number of rooms at each of their properties. Some registrants with casino operations disclose the
number of table games and slot machines at each location. Registrants in the restaurant industry
tend to disclose the number of their restaurants, location and whether they are registrant-operated
or franchisee-operated stores. In the paper mill or paper production industry, registrants
typically provide tabular disclosure for facilities including their geographic location and related
products or use. By contrast, some registrants, such as those that provide services or information
technology, may not have material physical properties and tend to disclose information about
their corporate headquarters, office space and other facilities.

Company Performance, Financial Information and Future Prospects

Financial information is essential to understanding a registrant’s performance, financial
condition and future prospects. The Commission has long recognized the need for a narrative
explanation of the financial statements, as a numerical presentation and accompanying footnotes
alone may be insufficient for an investor to assess the quality of the earnings and the likelihood
that past performance is indicative of future performance. 241
Regulation S-X requires companies to provide annual and quarterly financial
statements, 242 while several items in Regulation S-K require additional disclosure about a
registrant’s financial condition and results of operations:

241

See, e.g., 1989 MD&A Interpretive Release.

•

Item 302(a) requires disclosure of selected quarterly financial data; 243 and

We are reviewing these disclosure requirements to determine whether they continue to

provide investors with information that is important to evaluating a registrant’s performance,
financial condition and prospects for the future and what, if any, aspects of the disclosure
requirements are duplicative. We are seeking public input on whether we should consider any
new disclosure requirements and whether we should eliminate or modify any existing disclosure
requirement related to such matters.

Selected Financial Data (Item 301)

Item 301 requires registrants to disclose selected financial data that highlight significant
trends in the registrant’s financial condition and results of operations. 244 Disclosure must be
provided in comparative columnar form for each of the registrant’s last five fiscal years and any
additional fiscal years necessary to keep the information from being misleading. Instruction 2 to
Item 301 lists specific items that must be included, subject to appropriate variation to conform to
the nature of the registrant’s business, and provides that registrants may include additional items
they believe would enhance an understanding of and would highlight other trends in their

Five-Year Trend Data (Instruction 1)

i.

Discussion

Item 301 is intended to provide selected financial data in a convenient and readable
format that highlights significant trends in the registrant’s financial condition and results of
operations. 253 In adopting this requirement, the Commission stated that Item 301 was relevant
primarily where it related to trends in the registrant’s continuing operations. 254 When adopted,
this item replaced a previous requirement that called for a summary of operations. 255
Most of the items required by Item 301 are also required in the annual financial
statements. Unlike the financial statements required in a Form 10-K, however, Item 301
information covers each of the registrant’s last five fiscal years. Accordingly, Item 301

See 1980 Form 10-K Adopting Release. While the item in its current form was not adopted until 1980, the
concept of providing a five-year presentation of certain significant line items was suggested as early as 1967.
See Wheat Report at 338-39 (recommending that the Commission require registrants to provide a five-year
earnings summary annually).
In October 1970, the Commission expanded Form 10-K to include “Item 2 – Summary of Operations,” which
required registrants to furnish in comparative columnar form a five-year summary of operations and any
additional fiscal years necessary to keep the summary from being misleading. See Annual Reports by Certain
Companies Having Registered Securities, Release No. 34-9000 (Oct. 21, 1970) [35 FR 16919 (Nov. 3, 1970)]

income statement 256 and total assets and redeemable preferred stock in the balance sheets, 257
overlaps with disclosure in the financial statements for the most recent three and two years,
respectively. 258
Earlier years required to be disclosed under Item 301 are typically available in prior
annual reports. When the precursor to Item 301 was adopted in 1970, prior annual reports were
not readily accessible. 259 Today, these reports can be readily accessed through EDGAR and
other public sources, including company websites.
Despite some overlap with current and prior financial statements, Item 301 disclosure can
provide information that might not be available to investors for all five years. Specifically,
retrospective changes to the annual financial statements would typically be reflected in the
selected financial data table across all five years instead of the three years covered in the
financial statements. 260 For example, a registrant that retrospectively revises its annual financial
statements to reflect discontinued operations typically may need to consider whether it should
adjust years four and five in its selected financial data table in addition to the three most recent
years covered in the annual audited financial statements. Item 301 disclosure reflecting the
discontinued operations for these earlier two years would not be available in either the current or
prior financial statements.

Request for Comment

Is the Item 301 disclosure that is not otherwise available or readily accessible
important to investors? Are there benefits to having the five-year information in
one table?

68.

Should we retain, modify or eliminate Item 301? Why? Does it achieve the goal of
highlighting significant trends in a registrant’s financial condition and results of
operation? Does it also achieve the goal of providing selected financial data in a
convenient and readable format? How would the elimination of Item 301 affect
investors? Would elimination of this requirement increase costs to investors
because they would then need to obtain this information from prior filings?

69.

If we retain Item 301, should we modify this requirement and, if so, how? Should
we modify the item to require additional disclosure and, if so, what additional
disclosure would be important to investors and why?

70.

Instruction 1 to Item 303(a) specifies that, where trend information is relevant,
reference to the five-year selected financial data pursuant to Item 301 may be
necessary. 261 Despite this instruction, registrants generally do not discuss or
analyze trends outside the three-year timeframe of Item 303. Does selected
financial data effectively highlight significant trends that are not described
elsewhere? If so, is five years an appropriate period or should we modify the
number of fiscal years required to be included in the selected financial data? If
selected financial data does not effectively highlight significant trends that are not
described elsewhere, how could we modify our requirements to best achieve the

Items Included in Selected Financial Data (Instruction 2)

i.

Discussion

When proposing the requirement for selected financial data, the Commission sought to
strike a reasonable balance between specified content and a flexible approach that permits
registrants to select the data that best indicates performance. 263 The Commission noted that
commenters requested increased flexibility in the form and content of this disclosure in response
to an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. 264 Accordingly, while Instruction 2 to Item 301,
as adopted, contains prescriptive requirements, such as disclosure of total assets and income
(loss) from continuing operations, it also permits registrants the flexibility to include additional
items they believe would enhance an understanding of and would highlight other trends in their
financial condition and results of operations. 265
For registrants that provide additional items in their selected financial data, disclosure
varies. Financial institutions commonly provide additional metrics that may include return on
average assets and capital ratios. Registrants in the telecommunications industry may include the
number of subscribers while retailers may include the number of stores or average store size.
While such information is not required under U.S. GAAP, it is not considered a “non-GAAP
financial measure” such that reconciliation under Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K would be
required. 266 Additionally, some registrants include non-GAAP financial measures in their Item
301 disclosures.

Does Instruction 2 provide a reasonable balance between specified content and a
flexible approach that permits registrants to select the data that best indicates
performance? Why or why not? If not, how should we modify Instruction 2? For
example, should we modify Instruction 2 to be more prescriptive or provide for a
more flexible approach? If a flexible approach should be used, should we require
registrants to disclose their reasons for the items it included?

77. Should we require auditor involvement (e.g., audit, review or specified procedures)
for this disclosure, and if so, what should the nature of the involvement be? What
would be the benefits and costs to registrants and to investors?
78.

What is the impact of listing specific items of disclosure in Instruction 2? Do
registrants view the items listed in Instruction 2 as a checklist? Should additional
items be considered?

Supplementary Financial Information (Item 302)

Item 302(a)(1) requires certain registrants to disclose quarterly financial data of selected
operating results 267 and Item 302(a)(2) requires disclosure of variances in these results from

financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) operating measures or other measures that are
not non-GAAP financial measures. [17 CFR 229.10(e)(4)]. See also Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures, Release No. 33-8176 (Jan. 22, 2003) [68 FR 4819 (Jan. 30, 2003)] (“Non-GAAP Measures
Release”) (stating that operating and other statistical measures such as unit sales, numbers of employees,
numbers of subscribers, or numbers of advertisers are not non-GAAP financial measures).
267

Item 302(a)(1) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.302(a)(1)]. Item 302(a)(1) specifies disclosure of net sales,
gross profit (net sales less costs and expenses associated directly with or allocated to products sold or services
rendered), income (loss) before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting, per share
data based upon such income (loss), net income (loss) and net income (loss) attributable to the registrant, for
each full quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period for which financial
statements are included or are required to be included by Article 3 of Regulation S-X.
The staff is separately considering Item 302(b), which requires certain disclosures of oil and gas activities, as
part of its work to develop recommendations for the Commission for potential changes to update or simplify
certain disclosure requirements. For a description of this project, see Section I.

amounts previously reported. 268 Registrants must provide quarterly information for each full
quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent period for which financial
statements are included or required by Article 3 of Regulation S-X. Under Item 302(a)(3),
registrants must describe the effect of any disposals of segments of a business and extraordinary,
unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in each quarter, as well as the aggregate
effect and the nature of year-end or other adjustments that are material to the results of that
quarter. 269 If a registrant’s financial statements have been reported on by an accountant, Item
302(a)(4) requires that accountant to follow appropriate professional standards and procedures
regarding the data required by Item 302(a). 270

Discussion

A few years after adopting Form 10-Q, in 1974, the Commission noted that quarterly data
was still being “reported on an extremely abbreviated basis and annual financial statements [had]

Item 302(a)(2) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.302(a)(2)]. When disclosure in Item 302(a) varies from
amounts previously reported on the Form 10-Q filed for any quarter, such as if a combination between entities
under common control occurs or where an error is corrected, the registrant must disclose a reconciliation of the
amounts given with those previously reported and describe the reason for the difference.

269

Item 302(a)(3) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.302(a)(3)]. The requirement applies to items recognized in each
full quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period for which financial
statements are included or are required to be included.

generally been presented without regard for or disclosure of trends occurring within a year.” 272
To help remedy this information deficiency, the Commission adopted the precursor to Item
302(a), Rule 3-16(t) of Regulation S-X. This rule required, for certain registrants, disclosure of
selected quarterly financial data in the notes to the annual financial statements. 273
The Commission recognized that numerous commenters opposed the requirements,
suggesting that interim results are materially affected by random events and that including such
data in annual financial statements would lend them an appearance of reliability that could be
misleading. 274 The Commission nevertheless adopted the disclosure requirement, stating its
belief that this disclosure would “materially assist investors in understanding the pattern of
corporate activities throughout a fiscal period” by disclosing trends over segments of time that
are sufficiently short to reflect business turning points. 275 By contrast, the Commission stated
that annual periods “may obscure such turning points and may reflect a pattern of stability and
growth which is not consistent with business reality.” 276 The Commission also noted that
quarterly data would reflect seasonal patterns. Recognizing the costs of providing quarterly data,
the Commission provided an exemption for smaller registrants and registrants whose shares were

(Oct. 6, 1975)] (“1975 Interim Financial Reporting Release”). Rule 3-16(t) of Regulation S-X required
disclosure in a note to the financial statements of net sales, gross profit, income before extraordinary items and
cumulative effect of a change in accounting, per share data based upon such income, net income for each full
quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period for which income statements
are presented. It also required registrants to describe the effect of any disposals of segments of a business and
extraordinary, unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in each quarter, as well as the aggregate
effect and the nature of year-end or other adjustments which are material to the results of that quarter.
Furthermore, it required a reconciliation of amounts previously reported on Form 10-Q to the quarterly data
included in the note to financial statements if the amounts differ. See id.

not actively traded. 277 Because the selected quarterly financial data was unaudited, and
recognizing that information contained within the financial statements should be audited, the
Commission moved the requirement to Regulation S-K in 1980. 278
While most of the disclosure required by Item 302(a) is required in prior quarterly
reports, Item 302(a)(1) also requires a separate presentation of certain items for a registrant’s
fourth quarter, which is not otherwise required. Although there is no similar requirement for
disclosing the fourth fiscal quarter, U.S. GAAP typically allows investors to infer fourth quarter
data by requiring disclosure of disposals of components of an entity and unusual or infrequently
occurring items recognized in the fourth quarter. 279
Additionally, as Item 302(a)(2) requires disclosure of variances in results from amounts
previously reported for the two most recent fiscal years, the effect of a retrospective change in
any quarter for which a Form 10-Q was filed in the more recent of the two fiscal years will be
disclosed in the selected quarterly data. Absent Item 302(a)(2), this variance would not be

See id. at 46107 (“The Commission believes that the greatest investor need for these data exists in the case of
such companies whose activities are most closely followed by analysts and investors. Accordingly, registrants

the present time.”).

requirements only applied to registrants who met certain tests, including but not limited to: (1) two of the three
following requirements: (a) shares outstanding have a market value of at least $2.5 million; (b) the minimum
bid price is at least $5 per share; or (c) the registrant has at least $2.5 million of capital, surplus, and undivided
profits; and (2) the registrant and its subsidiaries: (a) have had net income after taxes but before extraordinary
items and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting of at least $250,000 for each of the last three fiscal
years; or (b) had total assets of at least $200 million for the last fiscal year end. See id.

ASC 270-10-50-2 requires the disclosure of certain information if interim data and disclosures are not

Content and Focus of MD&A (Item 303 - Generally)

Item 303 of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of information relevant to assessing a
registrant’s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. 283 Item
303(a) contains three core components that registrants must analyze in their MD&A disclosures:
liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations. 284 Item 303(a) also requires disclosure of
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations. 285
Overall, these MD&A requirements are intended to satisfy three principal objectives:
•

provide a narrative explanation of a registrant’s financial statements that enables
investors to see the registrant through the eyes of management;

•

enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial
information should be analyzed; and

•

provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, a registrant’s
earnings and cash flow, so investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is
indicative of future performance. 286
The Commission has provided substantial guidance in the past intended to improve the

quality of MD&A disclosures. 287 Much of this guidance has focused on the following topics:

283

Instruction 2 to Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.303(a)].

commenter suggested placing the disclosure at the beginning of annual reports on Forms 10-K
and 20-F. One commenter stated there should be “greater clarity” between the type of forwardlooking information required in MD&A versus the “future-oriented” information that the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) believes is appropriate. 293
One commenter suggested consolidating Commission and staff guidance on MD&A,
stating that consolidation would reduce the time and effort necessary to identify and read all
applicable sources and improve the quality of MD&A disclosure. 294 This commenter
recommended consolidating all applicable guidance in a single, electronically-accessible location
with hyperlinks to relevant sources, or alternatively, revising Item 303 to codify prior staff
guidance. 295 This commenter also recommended adding instructions throughout Item 303
indicating that, to the extent disclosure in response to the item is included in the notes to the
financial statements, registrants should use cross-references to avoid duplicative disclosure. 296

Quality and Focus of Analysis

Discussion

MD&A requires not only a discussion but also an analysis of known material trends and
uncertainties and should not reiterate financial statement information in a narrative form. 297 The
Commission has previously stated that a thorough analysis should assess both the effects of

known material trends and uncertainties and the reasons underlying those effects. 298 The
Commission has also stated that, if there is a reasonable likelihood that reported financial
information is not indicative of a registrant’s future financial condition or future operating
performance, then registrants should disclose the underlying reasons. 299
The Commission has focused on improving the analysis in MD&A for many years. For
example, the 1989 MD&A Interpretive Release explained that MD&A is intended to give
investors an opportunity to look at a registrant through the eyes of management by providing
both a short and long-term analysis of the business of the registrant. 300 Despite Item 303(a)’s
instruction to the contrary, 301 many registrants simply recite the amounts of changes from year to
year which are readily computable from their financial statements. In 2003 guidance, the
Commission added that such recitation of financial statements in narrative form fails to provide
the unique perspective available to management that MD&A is meant to capture. 302 An effective
analysis of known material trends, events, demands, commitments and uncertainties should
include an explanation of the underlying reasons or implications, interrelationships between
constituent elements, or the relative significance of those matters. 303
Prior to 1980, Commission rules required registrants to provide a summary of earnings,
including a discussion of unusual conditions that affected the appropriateness of the earnings

298

See id.

299

See id. As an example, the Commission stated that if a change in an estimate has a material favorable impact
on earnings, the change and the underlying reasons should be disclosed so that readers do not incorrectly
attribute the effect to operational improvements.

presentations. 304 The rules also required registrants to discuss items of revenue or expense that
changed more than ten percent from the prior period or changed more than two percent of the
average net income or loss for the most recent three years presented. In adding MD&A to
Regulation S-K in 1980, the Commission replaced the percentage thresholds with a principlesbased approach that primarily focused on materiality. 305 The Commission noted that the
percentage tests applied without regard to any concept of materiality or significance to the
registrant’s business, resulting in meaningful discussion often being obscured by information of
little relevance. 306
Commission guidance has continued to stress the importance of materiality in MD&A
and stated that disclosure should emphasize material information and de-emphasize or, if
appropriate, delete immaterial information. 307 The text of Item 303 ties several specific
requirements to materiality. For example, disclosure of known trends in liquidity is required if
such trends are reasonably likely to affect liquidity “in any material way.” 308 Commitments for
capital expenditures that are material must be described as of the end of the latest fiscal

that predated Regulation S-K. See infra note 344.

any concept of materiality or significance to the registrant's business. Accordingly, although some portions of
the resulting discussion may be meaningful, the meaningful discussion is often obscured by the inclusion of
material which is of little relevance.”). The Commission also clarified that causes of material changes in line
items must be described only to the extent necessary to an understanding of a company’s business as a whole.

“materially affected” reported income from continuing operations. 310
In addition to emphasizing materiality, the Commission has also recommended a “layered
approach” as a way to improve the quality of analysis in MD&A. 311 A layered approach requires
registrants to present information in a manner that emphasizes, within the universe of material
information that is disclosed, the information and analysis that is most important. 312 While not
required by Item 303, providing an executive-level overview to MD&A may be one way of
taking a layered approach.
Executive-level overviews should discuss the most important matters to MD&A, and the
Commission has cautioned that this overview should not be a duplicative layer of disclosure
repeated elsewhere. 313 Rather than summarize information already disclosed, the executive
overview should provide a balanced, high-level discussion that identifies the most important
themes or other significant matters with which management is concerned primarily in evaluating
the registrant’s financial condition and operating results. The overview should provide insight
into material opportunities, challenges and risks, such as those presented by known material
trends and uncertainties, on which the registrant’s executives are most focused for both the short

Forward-Looking Information

i.

Discussion

Discussion and analysis of known trends, demands, commitments, events and
uncertainties requires disclosure of forward-looking information. 316 This information is
significant to understanding a registrant’s expected future performance. The Commission
previously has provided guidance relating to the standard for disclosure of forward-looking
information and encouraged registrants to provide such forward-looking disclosure. 317

316

For example, the following provisions in Item 303 require disclosure of prospective information: Item 303(a)(1)
(any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are
reasonably likely to result in the registrant’s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way); Item
303(a)(2)(ii) (any known material trends in capital resources and any expected material changes in the mix and
relative cost of capital resources); Item 303(a)(3)(ii) (any known trends or uncertainties that the registrant
reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income
from continuing operations); and Instruction 3 to Item 303(a) (descriptions and amounts of matters that would
have an impact on future operations and have not had an impact in the past and matters that have had an impact
on reported operations and are not expected to have an impact upon future operations.).

317

See 2003 MD&A Interpretive Release at 75059 (“In addressing prospective financial condition and operating
performance, there are circumstances, particularly regarding known material trends and uncertainties, where
forward-looking information is required to be disclosed. We also encourage companies to discuss prospective
matters and include forward-looking information in circumstances where that information may not be required,
but will provide useful material information for investors that promotes understanding.”).

105

In 1987, the Commission distinguished between required and optional forward-looking
disclosure: required forward-looking disclosure is based on currently known trends, events and
uncertainties that are reasonably expected to have material effects, while optional forwardlooking disclosure involves either anticipating a future trend or event or anticipating a less
predictable impact of a known event, trend or uncertainty. 318 In 1989, the Commission
articulated a two-step test (“two-step test”) for assessing when forward-looking disclosure is
required in MD&A:
“Where a trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty is known, management must
make two assessments:
(1) Is the known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty likely to come
to fruition? If management determines that it is not reasonably likely to occur, no
disclosure is required.
(2) If management cannot make that determination, it must evaluate objectively
the consequences of the known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty,
on the assumption that it will come to fruition. Disclosure is then required unless
management determines that a material effect on the registrant’s financial
condition or results of operations is not reasonably likely to occur.” 319

No. 33-6711 (Apr. 17, 1987) [52 FR 13715 (Apr. 24, 1987)].
In 1989, the Commission also explained that the safe harbors of Securities Act Rule 175(c) and Exchange Act
Rule 3b-6(c) apply to required statements concerning the future effect of known material trends and
uncertainties. See 1989 MD&A Interpretive Release.
The Commission adopted the foregoing rules in 1979 to encourage the disclosure of projections and forwardlooking information as recommended by the Sommer Report. See Safe Harbor Rule for Projections, Release
No. 33-6084 (June 25, 1979) [44 FR 38810 (July 2, 1979)].

See 1989 MD&A Interpretive Release at 22430.

106

For forward-looking information, the Commission distinguished the standard for disclosure
under Item 303 from the standard for disclosure necessary to avoid liability for fraud under Rule
10b-5 and stated that the “probability/magnitude test for materiality approved by the Supreme
Court in Basic, Inc., v. Levinson…is inapposite to Item 303 disclosure.” 320 The Commission has
also stated that this “reasonably likely” standard is a lower threshold than “more likely than
not.” 321
Several federal courts of appeals have since referenced the Commission’s two-step test
and addressed its role in potential liability under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
thereunder. Although the courts are divided on the issue of whether Item 303 requirements
create a general duty to disclose in the Rule 10b-5 context, these courts have agreed that the
Supreme Court’s standard in Basic v. Levinson is the appropriate standard for determining
liability under Rule 10b-5 rather than the Commission’s two-step test. 322

why not? How do registrants determine when something is “reasonably likely” to
occur?
100. Should we revise the two-step test to apply a different standard in the first prong
and if so, how? For example, should we require disclosure when a trend, event or
uncertainty is more likely than not, probable, or reasonably possible to occur, rather
than “reasonably likely” to occur? 323
101. Should we eliminate the two-step test in favor of a different standard for
identifying required and optional forward-looking disclosure and, if so, what test
would be appropriate? For example, should we revise Item 303 to incorporate the
probability/magnitude standard from Basic v. Levinson? 324 Which standard – the
two-part test, Basic’s probability/magnitude standard, or some other standard –
should we require, and why? Would any particular formulation be more or less
burdensome for registrants?
102. We have stated previously that quantification of the material effects of known
material trends and uncertainties can promote understanding and may be required to
323

See ASC 450-20-25-1. Under U.S. GAAP, when a loss contingency exists, the likelihood that the future event
or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability can range from probable
to remote. The areas within that range are: probable (the future event or events are likely to occur), reasonably
possible (the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely) and remote
(the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight).
In the context of Item 303(a)(4) (off-balance sheet arrangements), the Commission previously considered
whether the “reasonably likely” threshold was appropriate for prospective information. Most commenters
supported the “reasonably likely” standard. Many commenters opposed a “remote” threshold stating it would
be difficult for management to apply, yield voluminous disclosures; attribute undue prominence to information
that is not important to investors; confuse or mislead investors; and elicit information that would not be
comparable among firms. The Commission adopted the “reasonably likely” threshold concluding that it
focused on the information most important to an understanding of a registrant’s off-balance sheet arrangements
and their material effects. The Commission also noted potential difficulty in attempting to comply with the
“remote” threshold and that use of a consistent threshold throughout MD&A would preclude the potential
confusion that could result from disparate thresholds. See Off-Balance Sheet and Contractual Obligations

uncertainties? Why?

Key Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance

i.

Discussion

The Commission has previously stressed that registrants should identify and address
those key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are peculiar to and
necessary for an understanding and evaluation of the individual registrant. 326 Key performance
indicators include both financial and non-financial measures. Non-financial measures may relate
to external or macro-economic matters as well as those specific to a registrant or industry. 327
The Commission has also encouraged registrants to consider whether disclosure of all key
variables and other factors that management uses to manage the business would be material to
investors or would promote an understanding of MD&A. 328
Some registrants discuss industry-specific key performance indicators in MD&A,
although there is not a specific requirement for this disclosure. For example, electronic gaming

Federal Register]).

327

External or macro-economic matters, such as interest rates or economic growth rates, and their anticipated
trends can be important variables for many registrants. The Commission has further encouraged registrants to
consider disclosing information that may be peripheral to the accounting function, but is integral to the business
or operating activity. Examples of such measures, depending on the circumstances of a particular registrant,
can include those based on units or volume, customer satisfaction, time-to-market, interest rates, product
development, service offerings, throughput capacity, affiliations/joint undertakings, market demand,
customer/vendor relations, employee retention, business strategy, changes in the managerial approach or
structure, regulatory actions or regulatory environment, and any other pertinent macroeconomic measures. See
2003 MD&A Interpretive Release at note 27 and accompanying text.

or social media companies typically discuss their numbers of monthly active users; numbers of
unique users; numbers of unique payers; and other metrics relating to usage. Software service
companies typically discuss their numbers of subscribers; customer renewal rates; and customer
retention rates. Hospitals typically discuss their numbers of admissions; numbers of beds; the
average length of inpatient stays; and occupancy rates. Retailers typically discuss comparable
store sales, sales per square foot or gross merchandise value. Recent academic studies find that
the industry-specific key factors disclosed by retailers and manufacturers provide incremental
information that can help to predict registrants’ future performance beyond traditional financial
statement variables. 329
Where there is no commonly accepted method of calculating a particular non-financial
metric, the Commission has said that the registrant should provide an explanation of the
calculation of the metric to promote comparability across registrants within the industry. 330 In
addition, key performance indicators, where disclosed, should be included in a format that will
enhance the understanding of the discussion and analysis. 331

Results of Operations (Item 303(a)(3))

Item 303(a)(3) requires a discussion and analysis of a registrant’s results of operations
and specifies four areas of disclosure:
•

any unusual or infrequent events or transactions or any significant economic changes that
materially affected the amount of reported income from continuing operations and the
extent to which income was so affected; 332

•

known trends or uncertainties that have had, or that the registrant reasonably expects will
have, a material impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations; 333

•

material increases in net sales or revenues, including the extent such increases are
attributable to increases in prices, increases in the volume or amount of goods or services
being sold, or to the introduction of new products or services; 334 and

more confusion and distraction than elucidation among investors.” 340 Another one of these
commenters stated its belief that two years of financial statements is sufficient disclosure as the
five-year selected financial data would provide multiyear trend information. 341 This commenter
also stated its belief that a two year financial statement requirement would eliminate “clutter” in
MD&A and “allow users to focus on new, material information about the latest fiscal year.”
One commenter disagreed with eliminating the requirement to include prior-period
results in MD&A because doing so would require investors to look for the information
elsewhere. 342 One commenter suggested revising Instruction 4 to Item 303(a) to allow
registrants to omit a discussion of changes in line items on the financial statements, to the extent
those changes are not material and such omission would not materially impair an investor’s
understanding of the registrant’s results of operations. 343
b.

Discussion

Prior to the Commission’s adoption of the MD&A disclosure requirements, Guide 22 and
Guide 1 called for a summary of earnings and operations, as well as a full narrative explanation
of the summary. The Guides also called for a separate discussion and analysis of the summary,
including explanations of material changes from period to period in revenues and expenses. 344

See CCMC.

See Ernst & Young 2 (also noting that financial statements covering three years are more voluminous and costly
to prepare and that most foreign jurisdictions only require two years of financial statements).

343

See ABA 2.

344

Guide 22 applied only to registration statements under the Securities Act. Guide 1, applicable to Exchange Act
filings, was adopted in 1974 to require disclosure similar to that of Guide 22. While Guide 22 focused on a
summary of earnings, Guide 1 required a discussion and analysis of a registrant’s summary of operations. Both
Guides were eliminated in 1980 when their requirements were merged into a single requirement, now Item 303,
calling for discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. This represented a shift in
focus towards the financial statements rather than upon a summary of operations. See Guidelines Adopting
Release. When eliminating the Guides, the Commission noted that the “narrow approach” set forth in Guides 1
and 22 did not ordinarily produce a discussion that focused upon the financial condition of a registrant as a

113

This discussion was intended to enable investors to compare periodic results of operations and to
assess the source and probability of recurrence of earnings or losses. 345 When adding MD&A to
Regulation S-K in 1980, the Commission eliminated the summary of operations disclosure in
favor of new requirements for a discussion “focused on the financial statements” with an
emphasis on favorable or unfavorable trends and the identification of significant events or
uncertainties. 346 The Commission also expressed its view that a three-year financial statement
requirement provides the minimum data necessary for an understanding of the changes in
performance for two years. 347
In 2003, the staff conducted a review of annual reports filed by all Fortune 500 registrants
and issued a significant number of comments seeking, among other things, greater analysis of
registrants’ results of operation. 348 The staff also discouraged registrants from providing rote
calculations of percentage changes of financial statement items and boilerplate explanations of
immaterial changes to these figures, encouraging them to include instead a detailed analysis of
material year-to-year changes and trends. 349 The staff continues to seek greater analysis of
material year-to-year changes and trends by encouraging registrants to quantify components of
material changes in financial statement line items and provide additional explanation of the
underlying factors that cause such changes.

or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are
reasonably likely to result in the registrant’s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material
way. 353 If a material deficiency is identified, a registrant must indicate the course of action it has
taken or proposes to take to remedy the deficiency. 354 Item 303(a)(1) also requires a registrant to

Analysis of “Liquidity” and “Capital Resources”

The Commission first adopted requirements for disclosure of liquidity and capital

registrant’s prospects for the future and even the likelihood of its survival. 360 The Commission
also has provided guidance regarding the type of information that a registrant should disclose
about its liquidity and capital resources. 361 In determining appropriate disclosure, registrants
should evaluate separately their ability to meet upcoming cash requirements over both the short
and long term. 362 Registrants are expected to use the statement of cash flows and other
indicators in analyzing their liquidity and to present a balanced discussion dealing with cash
flows from investing and financing activities as well as from operations. 363
Despite the Commission’s guidance, the staff has observed that discussions of liquidity
and capital resources often recite various changes in line items from the statement of cash flows
without a detailed analysis. Although registrants generally discuss their liquidity needs and the
sources of cash available to meet those needs as of the end of the reporting period, disclosure of
known trends and uncertainties affecting their future needs and availability of cash often is less
detailed.
When adopting disclosure requirements for liquidity and capital resources, the
Commission recognized that the terms “liquidity” and “capital resources” lacked precision in
definition but stated that “additional specificity would decrease the flexibility needed by
management for a meaningful discussion.” 364 The Commission stated its intent for management

See 2003 MD&A Interpretive Release. See also 2010 Liquidity and Capital Resources Interpretive Release
(stating that as financing activities undertaken by registrants become more diverse and complex, it is
increasingly important that the discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources provided by registrants
meet the objectives of MD&A).

ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash. 366

Request for Comment

113. How could we revise Item 303(a) to elicit a more meaningful analysis of a
registrant’s liquidity and capital resources while retaining the flexibility of
registrants to analyze liquidity and capital resources in the context of their business
and the way they manage liquidity?
114. Item 303(a) provides that discussions of liquidity and capital resources may be
combined whenever the two topics are interrelated. Would it lead to more useful
analysis if we required registrants to provide separate disclosure of these two
topics? Why? Would doing so encourage greater disclosure of trends, events and
uncertainties affecting capital resources?
115. When drafting MD&A, how do registrants currently interpret the term “capital
resources”? Would defining the term “capital resources” be helpful for registrants
or, alternatively, is the plain meaning of the term sufficiently clear? In light of the
reference to capital expenditures and the sources of funds needed to fulfill those
expenditures in Item 303(a)(2)(i), do registrants currently interpret the term “capital
resources” as including mostly funds committed for material capital expenditures
and the source of those funds?

116. Should we modify the definition of “liquidity” in Instruction 5 to Item 303(a) and, if
so, how?
117. For what periods should we require discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital
resources and why? Should our requirements include more periods than what is
required by the statement of cash flows? Why? Are developments in the most
recent fiscal year sufficient to constitute a “trend” as the term is used in Item 303?
118. Should we require registrants to provide a sensitivity analysis in the discussion and
analysis of liquidity and capital resources? If so, what should be the nature of such
an analysis? If not, why not?
119. Should the registrant provide additional measures of intra-period liquidity and
capital resources? For example, should the registrant provide measures of average
daily liquidity, average quarterly liquidity, or other measures? Should the registrant
provide a chart or graph of intra-period liquidity? How should such information be
considered in connection with the information provided at the end of the quarter?
120. Should we consider more detailed disclosure requirements for liquidity, such as
liquidity risks and maturity mismatches?

Short-Term Borrowings

i.

Discussion

Access to short-term borrowings for working capital and to fund operations can be an
important component of a registrant’s liquidity and capital resources. 367 Short-term borrowings

include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, 368
commercial paper, 369 borrowings from banks, borrowings from factors or other financial
institutions, and any other short-term borrowings reflected on the registrant’s balance sheet. 370
Short-term borrowings are common among financial institutions and industrial
companies alike. 371 In the last few years, low interest rates have prompted many non-financial
registrants to take advantage of lower borrowing costs and use short-term borrowings to, among
other things, buy back stock and pay off longer-term debt. 372 For one type of short-term
borrowing, repurchase agreements, advancements in technology and changes in the regulatory
landscape have made it more efficient for parties to engage in these transactions, likely
increasing the amount of activity in this market. 373
368

ASC 860-10 defines a repurchase agreement as an arrangement under which the transferor (repo party) transfers
a security to the transferee (repo counterparty or reverse party) in exchange for cash and concurrently agrees to
reacquire the security at a future date for an amount equal to the cash exchanged plus a stipulated interest factor.

369

Commercial paper consists of short-term promissory notes issued primarily by corporations. Maturities range
up to 270 days but average about 30 days.

370

See Rules 5-19 and 9-03.13(3) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.5-19 and 210.9-03.13(3)].

371

For example, the Federal Reserve Board reported that domestic outstanding commercial paper balances at the
end of December 2015 were $174.5 billion for non-financial issuers and $206.6 billion for financial issuers
respectively. See Commercial Paper Outstanding (last visited March 21, 2016) available at

dealers appear to represent the largest participants in the market for repurchase agreements, non-dealer activity
has likely increased such as through service providers that allow non-dealer counterparties to engage directly in
a repurchase agreement without an intermediary).

121

Short-term borrowings can be affected, sometimes severely and rapidly, by illiquidity in
the markets as a whole. 374 This market illiquidity can present increased risks to registrants who
rely on short-term borrowings. 375 Due to their short-term nature, a registrant’s use of such
arrangements can fluctuate significantly during a reporting period. As a result, presentation of
period-end amounts of short-term borrowings alone may not accurately capture a registrant’s
funding needs or use of such borrowings during the relevant period. 376
Our rules require a liquidity analysis on both a long-term and short-term basis. 377 The
Commission has stated that registrants should consider describing the sources of short-term
funding and the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources of liquidity. 378
In addition, the Commission and its staff have provided guidance that certain registrants should

See 2002 Commission Statement about MD&A at 3748 (“MD&A disclosures should not be overly general. For

funding and the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources of liquidity.”).

122

disclose short-term borrowings to the extent relevant and material to the operations of the
entity. 379
The Commission has previously considered the applicability of short-term borrowing
disclosure requirements for all registrants. In 1994, in connection with the elimination of various
financial statement disclosure schedules, the Commission eliminated a short-term borrowings
disclosure requirement for registrants that were not bank holding companies. 380 Former Rule
12-10 of Regulation S-X required those registrants to include with their financial statements a
schedule of short-term borrowings that disclosed the maximum amount outstanding during the
year, the average amount outstanding during the year, and the weighted-average interest rate
during the period, with amounts broken out into specified categories of short-term borrowings. 381
In proposing to eliminate this schedule, the Commission noted “the disclosures concerning the
registrant’s liquidity and capital resources that are required in the MD&A would appear to be
sufficiently informational to permit elimination of the short term borrowing schedule.” 382 In

See 2010 Liquidity and Capital Resources Interpretive Release at 59895 (stating that, “if the registrant’s
financial statements do not adequately convey the registrant’s financing arrangements during the period, or the

uncertainty, additional narrative disclosure should be considered and may be required to enable an
understanding of the amounts depicted in the financial statements”); Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by

repealing Rule 12-10, the Commission “concluded that the costs of furnishing the information
outweigh[ed] its usefulness.” 383
In 2010, the Commission proposed new disclosure requirements for short-term
borrowings. 384 When proposing these rules, the Commission stated its belief that they differed
from former Rule 12-10 by, among other things, requiring short-term borrowings disclosure in
MD&A, in tabular form, alongside a discussion and analysis to provide context for the
quantitative data. 385 Some commenters expressed concern about these proposed rules and
emphasized the costs associated with compliance, which they asserted would outweigh the
usefulness of the disclosure. A significant number of commenters were financial institutions 386
and related organizations, 387 with only a small number of investors submitting comments. 388
383

See Financial Schedules Adopting Release at 65635.

384

See Short-Term Borrowings Proposing Release. As proposed, these rules would have codified the provisions in
Industry Guide 3 for disclosure of short-term borrowings in Regulation S-K for all registrants. These proposed
rules were intended to provide important information so investors could better understand the role of short-term
financing and the related risks to the registrant. At that time, the Commission proposed amending its MD&A
requirements to include a new section that would provide tabular information of a registrant’s short-term
borrowings, as well as a discussion and analysis of these borrowings. These proposed amendments would have
(i) expanded the Industry Guide 3 provisions for disclosure of short-term borrowings in Regulation S-K, (ii)
required disclosure on an annual and quarterly basis, and (iii) expanded Industry Guide 3 disclosure to all
registrants that provide an MD&A. If the proposals had been adopted, the Commission would have authorized
the staff to eliminate the corresponding provisions of Industry Guide 3 to avoid redundant disclosure
requirements. See id. at 59868, footnote note 21 and accompanying text.

and recommended “more granular disclosure on repo portfolios.” Some of Fidelity’s recommendations have
since been addressed by revised FASB guidance on accounting for repurchase financings. Registrants currently
are required to disclose information on transfers accounted for as sales in transactions that are economically
similar to repurchase agreements. In addition, registrants must provide increased transparency about the types
of collateral pledged in repurchase agreements and similar transactions accounted for as secured borrowings.
See ASU 2014-11 “Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase
Financings, and Disclosures.”

124

While the Commission did not adopt these rules, there have been other regulatory actions
relating to short-term borrowings disclosure. 389
While a number of commenters generally supported the proposed rules’ objectives of
greater transparency of short-term borrowings as part of a registrant’s overall liquidity profile,
they also expressed numerous concerns about the quantitative requirements of the proposed rule.
For example, commenters were opposed to the proposed requirement to further disaggregate
amounts in the table by currency, interest rate or other meaningful category 390 as well as the
proposed requirement to disclose all categories of short-term borrowings by eliminating a
threshold for allowing aggregation into categories. 391

disclosure or analysis that registrants do not already provide under current

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Item 303(a)(4))

Item 303(a)(4) requires, in a separately-captioned section, disclosure of a registrant’s offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
a registrant’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 392 To
the extent necessary to an understanding of such arrangements and effect, registrants must
disclose the following items and such other information that the registrant believes is necessary
for such an understanding:
•

the nature and business purpose of such off-balance sheet arrangements;

•

the importance to the registrant of such off-balance sheet arrangements in respect of
its liquidity, capital resources, market risk support, credit risk support or other
benefits;

•

the amounts of revenues, expenses and cash flows arising from such arrangements;
the nature and amounts of any interests retained, securities issued and other

indebtedness incurred in connection with such arrangements; and the nature and
amounts of any other obligations or liabilities (including contingent obligations or
liabilities) of the registrant arising from such arrangements that are or are reasonably
likely to become material and the triggering events or circumstances that could cause
them to arise; and
•

any known event, demand, commitment, trend or uncertainty that will result in or is
reasonably likely to result in the termination, or material reduction in availability of a
registrant’s off-balance sheet arrangements that provide material benefits, and the
course of action that the registrant has taken or proposes to take in response to any
such circumstances.

Item 303(a)(4)(ii) defines off-balance sheet arrangements as certain guarantees, retained or
contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity, obligations under certain
derivative instruments, 393 and variable interests in an unconsolidated entity.

Discussion

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act required the Commission to adopt rules providing that each
annual and quarterly financial report required to be filed with the Commission must include
disclosure about off-balance sheet arrangements. 398 Earlier in 2002, prior to enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission issued a statement on the desirability of enhanced
disclosure in MD&A of off-balance sheet arrangements. 399 Much of the language and many of
the concepts in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were consistent with the language and concepts in this
Commission statement. 400
In its 2002 statement, the Commission noted that off-balance sheet arrangements often
are integral to both liquidity and capital resources and that registrants should “consider all of

396

See ABA 1. For example, this commenter suggested requiring registrants to disclose the potential impact on the
registrant of the acceleration or increase of material off-balance sheet arrangements.

397

See CFA Institute. This commenter did not provide specific recommendations on how to improve this
disclosure.

398

Section 401(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act added Section 13(j) to the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78m(j)], which
directed the Commission to adopt rules requiring each annual and quarterly financial report filed with the
Commission to disclose “all material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including
contingent obligations), and other relationships of the issuer with unconsolidated entities or other persons, that
may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenues or
expenses.”

these items together, as well as individually,” when drafting MD&A disclosure. 401 The
Commission further noted that off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions with
unconsolidated, limited purpose entities should be discussed pursuant to Item 303(a) when they
are “reasonably likely to affect materially liquidity or the availability of or requirements for
capital resources.” 402
The 2002 statement was consistent with Commission rules and guidance existing at the
time. For example, Item 303(a)(2)(ii) specifically required registrants to disclose off-balance
sheet financing arrangements in their discussion of capital resources. 403 Similarly, the 1989
MD&A Interpretive Release indicated that a registrant’s discussion of long-term liquidity and
long-term capital resources must address demands or commitments, including any off-balance
sheet items. 404
In response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission adopted more specific disclosure
requirements for off-balance sheet arrangements in 2003. 405 When adopting these rules, the
Commission reiterated that, while only one item in its MD&A rules specifically identifies offbalance sheet arrangements, 406 other requirements “clearly require disclosure of off-balance
sheet arrangements if necessary to an understanding of a registrant’s financial condition, changes

403

Item 303(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.303(a)(2)(ii)]. The item specifies that the discussion shall
consider changes between equity, debt and any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

404

See 1989 MD&A Interpretive Release at 22431 (“The discussion of long-term liquidity and long-term capital
resources must address material capital expenditures, significant balloon payments or other payments due on
long-term obligations, and other demands or commitments, including any off-balance sheet items, to be
incurred beyond the next 12 months, as well as the proposed sources of funding required to satisfy such
obligations.”).

in financial condition or results of operations.” 407 The new rules were intended to clarify the
disclosures that registrants must make about off-balance sheet arrangements and required
registrants to provide those disclosures in a separately designated section of MD&A. 408
In 2004, as part of a broader effort to expand the events that registrants must report on a
current basis, the Commission adopted additional requirements for disclosing off-balance sheet
arrangements on Form 8-K. 409 These new provisions of Form 8-K, which remain in effect today,
require registrants to file a report upon the creation of a direct financial obligation or an
obligation under an off-balance sheet arrangement (Item 2.03) and to file a report if a triggering
event occurs that causes the increase or acceleration of a such an obligation and the
consequences of the event are material to the registrant (Item 2.04). 410 While the Form 8-K
requirements rely on the definition of “off-balance sheet arrangement” in Item 303(a)(4)(ii), the
substance of the disclosure is different. Unlike Item 303(a)(4), Form 8-K does not require
registrants to provide an analysis of off-balance sheet arrangements or their importance to the
registrant.
In the proposing release for Item 303(a)(4), the Commission recognized that parts of the
proposed off-balance sheet disclosure requirements might overlap with disclosure presented in
the footnotes to the financial statements. The Commission stated that the proposed rules were
designed to provide more comprehensive information and analysis in MD&A than what was
provided in the footnotes. 411

Since the adoption of Item 303(a)(4), the FASB has issued additional requirements that
further overlap with this item. 412 Currently, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure about transactions or
arrangements that overlap with Item 303(a)(4)’s definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.
For example, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of the nature
and amount of a guarantee, 413 retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to
unconsolidated entities, 414 pertinent information of derivative instruments that are classified as
stockholder’s equity under U.S. GAAP, 415 and obligations under variable interests in
unconsolidated entities. 416
Because of this overlap, in response to Item 303(a)(4), registrants often provide crossreferences to the relevant notes to their financial statements or provide disclosure that is
duplicative of information in the notes. While many of the requirements in Item 303(a)(4)
overlap with U.S. GAAP, some of the requirements related to the location, presentation and
nature of the disclosure are not the same. Additionally, Item 303(a)(4) disclosure is not audited.
Location of Disclosure. In its 2002 statement, the Commission observed that investors
will often find information relating to a particular matter more meaningful if it is disclosed in a
single location, rather than presented in a fragmented manner throughout the filing. 417 In

412

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 140, which requires enhanced disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a
transferor’s continuing involvement with transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales. Also in June 2009,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which requires enhanced
disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement in a variable interest entity, including unconsolidated entities.
SFAS No. 166 and 167 have been codified as ASC Topics 860 (Transfers and Servicing) and 810
(Consolidation), respectively.

proposing the off-balance sheet disclosure requirements, the Commission identified as one of its
objectives to provide investors with information necessary to understand a registrant’s offbalance sheet arrangements that are neither readily apparent nor easily understood from reading
the financial statements alone. 418
Item 303(a)(4)(i) specifies that off-balance sheet arrangements should be discussed in a
separately-captioned section. The instructions to Item 303(a)(4) permit that discussion to crossreference to information provided in the footnotes to the financial statements, rather than repeat
it, provided that the MD&A disclosure integrates the substance of the footnotes in a manner
designed to inform readers of the significance of the information that is cross-referenced. 419 By
contrast, U.S. GAAP does not prescribe the location of these disclosures, which may be
dispersed throughout the notes to the financial statements. However, interactive data allows
investors to isolate disclosures about off-balance sheet arrangements even when it is dispersed
within the notes to the financial statements.
Presentation of Disclosure. Item 303(a)(4) requires disclosure for the most recent period
and a discussion of changes from the previous year where necessary to an understanding of the
disclosure. 420 U.S. GAAP does not require discussion of changes from the previous year.
Nature of Disclosures. While Item 303(a)(4) and U.S. GAAP both require disclosure of
the nature and amounts associated with off-balance sheet arrangements, Regulation S-K requires
additional disclosure about the business purpose of the off-balance sheet arrangement 421 and the
importance of the off-balance sheet arrangement to the registrant’s liquidity, capital resources,

is reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in the availability of
material off-balance sheet arrangements to the registrant and the course of action the registrant
has taken or proposes to take to address such circumstances. U.S. GAAP does not require this
disclosure.

Request for Comment

125. Does Item 303(a)(4) elicit disclosure that is important to investors? Is this
information otherwise available in Commission filings?
126. If we retain the disclosure requirements in Item 303(a)(4), should we expand the
disclosure required by this item? If so, what additional disclosure would be
important to investors and why? For example, should we revise our rules to require
registrants to analyze the risks and financial potential associated with its off-balance
sheet arrangements?
127. If we retain the disclosure requirements in Item 303(a)(4), should this information
be located in MD&A, the notes to the financial statements, or both? Is the location
of the disclosure important? Are there challenges associated with auditing this
information?
128. If we eliminate Item 303(a)(4), do the other requirements in Item 303 and the
requirements in U.S. GAAP require adequate disclosure in terms of the location,
presentation and nature of information about off-balance sheet arrangements?
Would eliminating Item 304(a)(4) result in costs to investors?

MD&A rules already require disclosure regarding off-balance sheet arrangements
and other contingencies.” 423 Do the disclosure requirements in Item 303 regarding
liquidity and capital resources require adequate disclosure about matters that will
result in or is reasonably likely to result in the termination or material reduction in
the availability of material off-balance sheet arrangements to the registrant and the
course of action the registrant has taken or proposes to take to address such
circumstances?
130. Should we require additional disclosure of off-balance sheet arrangements that
occurred during a reporting period, such as an exhibit identifying all such
arrangements?

Contractual Obligations (Item 303(a)(5))

Item 303(a)(5) requires tabular disclosure of a registrant’s known contractual obligations
for long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term
liabilities reflected on the registrant’s balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 424 The Commission has
defined the first three categories of obligations (long-term debt, capital leases and operating
leases) by reference to the relevant U.S. GAAP accounting pronouncements that require
disclosure of these obligations in the financial statements or notes thereto. 425
For purchase obligations, the Commission defined this term as an agreement to purchase
goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding on the registrant and specifies all significant

134

terms. 426 The Commission stated that the definition of “purchase obligations” is designed to
capture the registrant’s capital expenditures for purchases of goods or services over a five-year
period. 427 Some purchase obligations are executory contracts, and therefore are not recognized
as liabilities in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 428
The fifth category of contractual obligations, “Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on
the Registrant’s Balance Sheet under GAAP,” captures all other long-term liabilities that are
reflected on the registrant’s balance sheet under the registrant’s applicable U.S. GAAP.
Common examples of other obligations disclosed in this line-item of the table include
postretirement benefits, interest on debt, and tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions.
Item 303(a)(5) requires registrants to disclose the amounts of payments due by specified
time periods, aggregated by the type of contractual obligation. 429 Registrants must disclose
payments due in less than 1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years and more than 5 years, as well as the total,
aggregate amount of obligations in each category. Amounts are required to be set forth in the
aggregate and there is no materiality qualifier.

Discussion

In response to a 2001 petition for an interpretive release, 432 the Commission issued a
statement in 2002 recommending that registrants present information about contractual
obligations and commercial commitments in a single location within the filing. 433 The statement
included a recommended table of contractual obligations resembling that of current Item
303(a)(5). 434 This recommended table became a line-item requirement when the Commission
adopted Item 303(a)(5) in 2003. 435
When adopting Item 303(a)(5), the Commission recognized that much of the disclosure
required by this item is addressed under U.S. GAAP requirements. 436 Similarly, disclosure about
other obligations not required by U.S. GAAP, “such as purchase contracts, may or may not be

disclosed, but if disclosed, it is usually dispersed throughout the filing and may not be presented
in a consistent manner among registrants.” 437
By providing aggregated information of contractual obligations in a single location and
appropriate context for investors to assess the impact of off-balance sheet arrangements with
respect to liquidity and capital resources, Item 303(a)(5) was intended to improve transparency
of a registrant’s short- and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. This disclosure was
also intended to “improve an investor’s ability to compare registrants.” 438
The Commission has issued guidance on Item 303(a)(5) on one occasion since its
adoption. 439 In a 2010 interpretive release, the Commission noted that registrants and industry
groups had raised questions about how to treat a number of items under the contractual
obligations requirement, including: interest payments, repurchase agreements, tax liabilities,
synthetic leases, and obligations that arise under off-balance sheet arrangements. 440 Because the
questions tended to be fact-specific and closely related to a registrant’s particular business and
circumstances, the Commission declined to provide specific guidance about these items or the
presentation of the contractual obligations table. Instead, the Commission noted that the
requirement itself permits flexibility and encouraged registrants to develop a presentation

439

In the 2003 MD&A Interpretive Release, the Commission stated that it was not addressing specifically
disclosures of contractual obligations because it had had little experience with companies’ application of the
new rule, adopted a few months earlier. Nevertheless, the Commission noted that the overall guidance in the
2003 MD&A Interpretive Release is applicable to all MD&A discussions. See 2003 MD&A Interpretive
Release.

method that is clear, understandable and appropriately reflects the categories of obligations that
are meaningful in light of its capital structure and business. 441
The Commission’s guidance also explained that tabular disclosure of contractual
obligations should be prepared with the goal of presenting a meaningful snapshot of cash
requirements arising from contractual payment obligations. Registrants were instructed to
highlight any changes in presentation that are made so that investors may use the information to
make comparisons from period to period. The Commission suggested that footnotes should be
used to provide information necessary for an understanding of the timing and amount of
specified contractual obligations. Registrants also should consider additional narrative
discussion outside of the table to promote understanding of the tabular data. 442 In practice,
however, registrants typically do not include additional narrative with their contractual
obligations table.
c.

Request for Comment

131. Does the table of contractual obligations present a meaningful snapshot of a
registrant’s cash requirements for contractual obligations? How could the format of
the disclosure in the table be improved? Should we consider an alternative
presentation or format for this disclosure?
132. Should we require narrative disclosure to accompany the tabular disclosure? For
example, should we require registrants to discuss how they plan to meet current and

441

See id. The Commission noted that the staff has observed that divergent practices have developed in connection
with Item 303(a)(5) disclosure, with registrants drawing different conclusions about the information to be
included in the table, but also acknowledged that the rule permits flexibility so the presentation can reflect
company-specific information suitable to a company’s business.

future obligations disclosed in the table? If so, what additional narrative disclosure
would be useful to investors?
133. Item 303(a)(5) was intended to provide aggregated information of contractual
obligations in a single location and appropriate context for investors to assess the
impact of off-balance sheet arrangements with respect to liquidity and capital
resources. Would narrative disclosure improve readers’ ability to compare
registrants by reconciling the information in the table to information elsewhere in
MD&A and financial statements? Should comparability among registrants continue
to be a goal? Should we continue to require this disclosure in a single location or is
disclosure elicited under U.S. GAAP, in various parts of a registrant’s filings,
sufficient?
134. Item 303(a)(5) requires disclosure of five categories of contractual obligations.
Should we expand the rule to include other categories of contractual obligations and
if so, what categories should we consider?
135. Would additional guidance or instructions about how to treat certain types of
obligations, such as interest payments, repurchase agreements or tax liabilities, be
helpful to registrants in preparing this disclosure? Would such guidance limit the
intended flexibility of the rule?
136. In the 2010 Liquidity and Capital Resources Interpretive Release, the Commission
suggested that separating amounts in the table into those that are reflected on the
balance sheet and those arising from off-balance arrangements might be useful to a
clear understanding of the information presented. Should we revise Item 303(a)(5)
to require registrants to separate amounts in the table of contractual obligations into

139

those that are reflected on the balance sheet and those arising from off-balance sheet
arrangements? Should we require this disclosure pursuant to some threshold
amount?

Critical Accounting Estimates

A registrant’s results of operations, financial condition, and changes to financial
condition often depend on estimates involved in applying accounting policies that entail
uncertainties and subjectivity. Critical accounting estimates are those accounting judgments and
estimates that relate to the items that are material to the financial statements, taken as a whole,
and that management believes are most critical – that is, those that are most important to
portraying the registrant’s financial condition and results and require management’s most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 443 While U.S. GAAP requires financial statement
footnote disclosure about accounting policies, 444 Item 303 requires disclosure of trends, events or
uncertainties known to management that could materially affect reported financial information.
Item 303 does not specifically address critical accounting estimates.

In addition, this commenter suggested that we consider whether requiring independent auditor
negative assurance would enhance the quality of the recommended disclosures by imposing more
rigor in its preparation. 447 Another commenter recommended that the Commission work with
accounting standard-setters to improve financial statement presentation and related disclosures,
such as estimates, judgments and choices. 448 One commenter also suggested that the
Commission work with the auditing profession to eliminate descriptions of recent accounting
changes for pronouncements that have no effect on a registrant. 449 Another commenter
recommended that the Commission coordinate with the FASB to review and clarify the
disclosure objectives of critical accounting estimates in MD&A and significant accounting
policies in the financial statements to determine whether they provide distinct and useful
information and provide guidance on how both requirements should work best. 450
b.

Discussion

In 2001, the Commission encouraged registrants to explain in their MD&A the judgments
and uncertainties affecting the application of their critical accounting policies, as well as the
likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or

446

using different assumptions. 451 The Commission also stated its intent to consider new rules to
elicit more precise disclosures about the critical accounting policies. 452
In 2002, the Commission proposed new rules that would have required, among other
things, disclosure of accounting estimates resulting from the application of critical accounting
policies. 453 The proposed rules would have defined a “critical accounting estimate” as an
accounting estimate that meets the following two criteria: (i) the accounting estimate must
require the registrant to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the
accounting estimate is made; and (ii) it must be the case that different estimates that the
registrant reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or
changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period,
would have a material impact on the presentation of the registrant’s financial condition, changes
in financial condition or results of operations. 454 As proposed, registrants would have been
required to:
•

describe the critical accounting estimates (including the methodology underlying each
critical accounting estimate, assumptions about highly uncertain matters and other

451

See Cautionary Advice Release. The Commission alerted registrants to the need for greater investor awareness
of the sensitivity of financial statements to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying their preparation
and stated that the objective of this disclosure is consistent with the objective of MD&A.

452

See id.

453

See Disclosure in Management’s Discussion and Analysis about the Application of Critical Accounting
Policies, Release No. 33-8098 (May 10, 2002) [67 FR 35620 (May 20, 2002)] (“Critical Accounting Proposing
Release”). The Commission also proposed rules requiring a registrant that has initially adopted an accounting
policy with a material impact on its financial presentation to disclose information that includes: what gave rise
to the initial adoption; the impact of the adoption; the accounting principle adopted and method of applying it;
and the choices it had among accounting principles. See id.

assumptions that are material) and identify where and how they affect the registrant’s
reported financial results, financial condition and changes in financial condition; 455
•

provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the reported operating results and
financial condition to changes in the critical accounting estimates or their underlying
assumptions; 456 and

•

state whether or not senior management discussed the development, selection and
disclosure of those critical accounting estimates with the registrant’s audit committee. 457
The Commission did not adopt these rules, but subsequently provided interpretive

guidance on disclosure of critical accounting estimates. 458 In the 2003 MD&A Interpretive
Release, the Commission stated that registrants should provide disclosure about critical
accounting estimates or assumptions in MD&A where:
•

the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and
judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such
matters to change; and

•

the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating
performance is material. 459

455

Disclosure would have been required, if applicable, regarding why the accounting estimate was reasonably
likely to change in future periods with a material impact on the registrant’s financial presentation. In certain
situations, disclosures would have been required for individual segments of the registrant’s business.

456

More specifically, the rules would have required, for each critical accounting estimate, discussion of changes
that would result either from (i) making reasonably possible, near-term changes in the most material
assumptions underlying the estimate, or (ii) using in place of the recorded estimate the ends of the range of
reasonably possible amounts that the registrant likely determined when formulating its recorded estimate.

457

See Critical Accounting Proposing Release.

458

This interpretive guidance was provided based on the Division staff’s review of registrant disclosures, including
its Fortune 500 review. The Commission concluded that additional guidance would be especially useful in a
few areas of MD&A, including disclosure of critical accounting estimates. See 2003 MD&A Interpretive
Release.

459

See id.

143

The Commission also clarified that this disclosure should supplement, not duplicate, the
description of accounting policies that are already disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements. 460 While accounting policy notes in the financial statements generally describe the
method used to apply an accounting principle, the discussion in MD&A should present a
registrant’s analysis of the uncertainties involved in applying the principle. 461
Despite Commission guidance, many registrants repeat the discussion of significant
accounting policies from the notes to the financial statements in their discussion of critical
accounting estimates in MD&A and provide limited additional discussion of the critical
accounting estimates. We are seeking public input on how to revise our requirements to improve
the discussion of critical accounting estimates in MD&A.
c.

Request for Comment

137. Should we revise Item 303 to require disclosure about critical accounting estimates?
If so, what information would be important to investors?
138. Should we define “critical accounting estimates”? If so, should the definition be
based on our 2001 guidance, 462 the definition proposed in 2002, 463 or something
else? Why? Are there any other elements to a “critical accounting estimate” that
have not been captured in prior definitions?
460

See id. The Commission further stated that “[e]qually important, companies should address the questions that
arise once the critical accounting estimate or assumption has been identified, by analyzing, to the extent
material, such factors as how they arrived at the estimate, how accurate the estimate/assumption has been in the
past, how much the estimate/assumption has changed in the past, and whether the estimate/assumption is
reasonably likely to change in the future.” See id. at 75065.
The FASB has also stated that distinguishing between a change in an accounting principle and a change in an
accounting estimate is sometimes difficult, and in some cases, a change in accounting estimate is effected by a
change in accounting principle. See ASC Topic 250-10-45-18.

139. Why do registrants repeat the discussion of accounting policies presented in the
notes to the financial statements? How can we encourage registrants to eliminate
repetition in MD&A of the discussion of accounting policies provided in the notes
to the financial statements?
140. Do registrants find the guidance for disclosing critical accounting estimates from
the 2003 MD&A Interpretive Release helpful in determining whether such
disclosure is required? Would it be helpful for registrants if we incorporated this or
other elements of our guidance on critical accounting estimates into Regulation SK?
141. Should we revise our requirements to elicit more comparable disclosure among
registrants? If so, how? Should we adopt prescriptive requirements relating to
critical accounting estimates? Are there any accounting estimates common to a
particular industry that are “critical” to all participants in that industry?
142. Should we require the disclosure of management’s judgments and estimates that
form the basis for MD&A disclosure? For example, should we require registrants
to disclose the quantitative and qualitative factors that form its assessment of
materiality? Should we require registrants to disclose how they assessed
materiality?
143. Should we require management to disclose the nature of its assessment of errors
that it determined to be immaterial and therefore were not corrected?
144. Should we require disclosure of other critical accounting estimates, such as those
that impact other metrics or measures, such as the number of new customers or the
number of subscribers?

145

C.

Risk and Risk Management

Disclosure of a registrant’s most significant risks provides investors with important
context for assessing the registrant’s financial potential. Risk-related disclosure is required by
multiple items of Regulation S-K and certain financial reporting requirements. 464 In this section,
we focus on:
•

Item 503(c), which requires disclosure of the most significant factors that make an
investment in a registrant’s securities speculative or risky; 465 and

•

Item 305, which requires quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk. 466

Also in this section, we explore different approaches to risk-related disclosure. Specifically, we
consider whether requiring additional disclosure of management’s approach to risk and risk
management and consolidating risk-related disclosure would, on balance, be beneficial to
investors and registrants. We also seek to better understand how our disclosure requirements
could be updated to enhance investors’ ability to evaluate a registrant’s risk exposures. We are
especially interested in feedback on how we can improve the content and readability of the risk
factors included in a filing as well as the potential advantages and disadvantages of different
approaches to risk-related disclosure.

464

Although we focus on Items 503(c) and 305 of Regulation S-K, risk-related disclosure may be provided in
response to other requirements, such as Items 101(d)(3) (risk attendant to foreign operations), 103 (legal
proceedings), or 303 (MD&A). For financial reporting requirements, risk-related disclosure may be included in
the financial statements in response to ASC Topics 275 (risks and uncertainties), 450 (contingencies), or 825
(financial instruments), among others. The staff is separately considering Items 101(d)(3) and 103 in
developing recommendations for the Commission for potential changes to update or simplify certain disclosure
requirements. For a description of this project, see Section I. For a discussion of Item 303, see Section IV.B.3
to IV.B.7.

Risk Factors (Item 503(c))

Item 503(c) requires disclosure of the most significant factors that make an investment in
a registrant’s securities speculative or risky and specifies that the discussion should be concise
and organized logically. 467 Although the requirement is principles-based, it includes the
following specific examples as factors that may make an offering speculative or risky:
•

a registrant’s lack of an operating history,

•

a registrant’s lack of profitable operations in recent periods,

•

a registrant’s financial position,

•

a registrant’s business or proposed business, or

•

the lack of a market for a registrant’s common equity securities or securities convertible
or exercisable for common equity securities. 468

Additionally, Item 503(c) directs registrants to explain how each risk affects the registrant and
discourages disclosure of risks that could apply to any registrant.

likelihood and relative impact. 470 This proposed framework would require registrants to classify
both relative likelihood and relative impact into one of three tiers based on the risk’s probable
occurrence and the relative seriousness of the consequences if a risk materializes.
One commenter stated that risk factors should be more entity-specific and connected to
financial results. 471 Another commenter noted that registrants disclose risk factors that “go well
beyond those that make an investment ‘speculative’” and stated that any new risk factor
disclosure requirements should be principles-based. This commenter suggested revising Item
503(c) to include examples of generic disclosure that need not be included as risk factors. 472
One commenter generally recommended reducing lengthy, unnecessary risk factor disclosure. 473
Another commenter urged that any such requirement be grounded in the principle of materiality,
suggesting that we consider whether a reformulated risk discussion should highlight the risks that
management views as most significant. 474
Several comment letters stated there should be additional risk-related disclosure on
specific topics. 475 One set of commenters encouraged us to require additional disclosure about
cybersecurity and related risks. 476 Another group of commenters focused on additional

examples of generic risks that do not need to be disclosed as risk factors: macro-economic risks that effect all
businesses in a particular industry; general stock market risks, such as volatility in a company’s stock price;
summaries of regulation; and risk disclosure that repeats disclosure provided in response to other specific
requirements or financial disclosures, such as risks related to key management, legal proceedings and the
payment of dividends.

We received two comment letters on the impact of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act (“PSLRA”) on risk-related disclosure. One commenter acknowledged that liability
concerns may contribute to the length of Exchange Act documents but expressed concern about
any effort to require issuers to reduce the length or number of risk factors included in a filing. 478
Another commenter attributed the growing length of risk factor disclosure to liability concerns
and noted that any efforts to reduce risk factor disclosure, without concomitant changes to the
relevant rules or the protection of a safe harbor, are unlikely to be effective because there is little
incentive for registrants to scale-back risk factor disclosure. 479

Discussion

The five factors specified in Item 503(c) as factors that may make an offering speculative
or risky have not changed since the Commission published its initial guidance on risk factor
disclosure in 1964. These factors were derived from previous stop order proceedings under
Section 8(d) of the Securities Act where the Commission suspended the effectiveness of
previously filed registration statements due, in part, to inadequate disclosure about speculative
aspects of the registrant’s business. 480

477

See, e.g., Reps. Grijalva, Waters and Lowenthal; Sens. Cardin, et al.

478

See SCSGP (referencing the Commission’s proposal to limit the number of risk factors included in a filing in
connection with the Commission’s Plain English initiative and comments received in connection with that
initiative, one of which states “no issuer should ever be put in the position of choosing significant material risks
in order to satisfy a numerical limitation.”).

479

See Shearman (stating that the PSLRA’s safe harbor, which requires issuers that disclose forward-looking
information to also disclose cautionary information, contributes to lengthy risk factors disclosures).

27, 1963); In the Matter of Universal Camera Corporation, 19 S.E.C. 648 (June 28, 1945)).

149

Since the Commission first published guidance on risk factor disclosure in 1964, 481 it has
been reiterated that this disclosure should be:
•

focused on the “most significant” or “principal” factors that make a registrant’s securities
speculative or risky, 482

•

placed in the forefront of the filing, 483 and

•

organized and concise. 484

Commission and Division guidance also has emphasized that registrants should avoid “boiler
plate” risk factors, and that a discussion of risk in purely generic terms does not indicate how a
risk may affect an investment in a particular registrant. 485 When adding risk factor requirements
to annual and quarterly reports and Exchange Act registration statements on Form 10, the
Commission discouraged the unnecessary restatement of risk factors in quarterly reports,
emphasizing that quarterly reports need only disclose material changes from risk factors
previously disclosed in other Exchange Act reports. 486
The length and number of risk factors disclosed by registrants varies. Although Item
503(c) directs registrants to provide a concise risk factors discussion, one study found that

486

See Securities Offering Reform Release. In adopting new item requirements in Forms 10-K, 10-KSB, and 10 to
require risk factor disclosure, the Commission noted that, though not previously required, many registrants had
included for several years risk factor disclosure in their Exchange Act reports, perhaps to take advantage of the
safe harbor in Securities Act Section 27A and the judicially-created “bespeaks caution” defense.

150

registrants include an average of 22 different risk factors in disclosure spanning an average of 8
pages. 487 Another study found that registrants increased the length of risk factor disclosures
from 2006 to 2013 by more than eighty-five percent in terms of word count relative to the total
word count of Form 10-K filings, and that this increase in quantity may not be associated with
better disclosure. 488 A third study found that the average number of risk factors disclosed in
certain sectors of the energy industry ranged between twelve and fifty-one. 489 For quarterly
reports, it is not unusual for registrants to repeat the entire risk factor discussion from their
previously filed annual reports, 490 even though registrants are required to disclose only material
changes from previously disclosed risks. 491
Although Item 503(c) instructs registrants not to present risks that could apply to any
registrant, risk factor disclosure typically includes generic risk factors. Registrants often use risk
factors that are similar to those used by others in their industry or circumstances as the starting

examine the “informativeness” of risk factor disclosures, the authors of this study analyzed risk factor
disclosures about financial constraints and argue that as litigation risk increased during and after the financial
crisis, registrants were more likely to disclose immaterial information, resulting in a deterioration of disclosure
quality.

point for risk disclosure, and the disclosure is not always tailored to each registrant’s particular
risk profile. Examples of generic disclosures include risk factors about a registrant’s failure to
compete successfully, the effect of general economic conditions on a registrant’s business,
changes in regulation, and dependence upon a registrant’s management team. Despite the
inclusion of generic risks, however, academic studies find that risk factor disclosure is
informative and that the public availability of this information decreases information asymmetry
among investors. 492

Request for Comment

145. How could we improve risk factor disclosure? For example, should we revise our
rules to require that each risk factor be accompanied by a specific discussion of how
the registrant is addressing the risk?
146. Should we require registrants to discuss the probability of occurrence and the effect
on performance for each risk factor? If so, how could we modify our disclosure
requirements to best provide this information to investors? For example, should we
require registrants to describe their assessment of risks?
147. How could we modify our rules to require or encourage registrants to describe risks
with greater specificity and context? For example, should we require registrants to
disclose the specific facts and circumstances that make a given risk material to the
registrant? How should we balance investors’ need for detailed disclosure with the
requirement to provide risk factor disclosure that is “clear and concise”? Should we
revise our rules to require registrants to present their risk factors in order of

152

management’s perception of the magnitude of the risk or by order of importance to
management? Are there other ways we could improve the organization of
registrants’ risk factors disclosure? How would this help investors navigate the
disclosure?
148. What, if anything, detracts from an investor’s ability to gain important information
from a registrant’s risk factor disclosure? Do lengthy risk factor disclosures hinder
an investor’s ability to understand the most significant risks?
149. How could we revise our rules to discourage registrants from providing risk factor
disclosure that is not specific to the registrant but instead describes risks that are
common to an industry or to registrants in general? Alternatively, are generic risk
factors important to investors?
150. Should we specify generic risks that registrants are not required to disclose, and if
so, how should we identify those risks? Are there other ways that we could help
registrants focus their disclosure on material risks?
151. Should we retain or eliminate the examples provided in Item 503(c)? Should we
revise our requirements to include additional or different examples? Would
deleting these examples encourage registrants to focus on their own risk
identification process?
152. Should we require registrants to identify and disclose in order their ten most
significant risk factors without limiting the total number of risk factors disclosed? 493

493

The Commission has previously considered proposals to either limit the number of risk factors included in a
filing or require registrants to list risk factors in the order of priority to the registrant. The Commission did not
adopt either of these requirements in response to comments received from investors. See Plain English
Disclosure Adopting Release at 6370 (“In response to comments, the new rules will not require issuers to limit
the length of the summary, limit the number of risk factors, or prioritize risk factors.”).

153

If so, should other risk factors be included in a separate section of the filing or in an
exhibit to distinguish them from the most significant risks? Alternatively, should
we require registrants to provide a risk factors summary in addition to the complete
disclosure? Would a summary help investors better understand a registrant’s risks
by highlighting certain information? Are there challenges associated with requiring
a summary of the most significant risks?
153. Are there ways, in addition to those we have used in Item 503, our Plain English
Rules and guidance on MD&A, to ensure that registrants include meaningful, rather
than boilerplate, risk factor disclosure?
154. Risk profiles of registrants are constantly changing and evolving. For example,
registrants today face risks, such as those associated with cybersecurity, climate
change, and arctic drilling, 494 that may not have existed when the 1964 Guides and
1968 Guides were published. Is Item 503(c) effective for capturing emerging risks?
If not, how should we revise Item 503(c) to make it more effective in this regard?
155. What types of investors or audiences are most likely to value the Item 503(c)
disclosures?
156. What is the cost of providing the disclosure required by Item 503(c), including the
administrative and compliance costs of preparing and disseminating this disclosure?
How would these costs change if we made any of the changes contemplated here?
Please provide quantified estimates where possible and include only those costs
associated with providing disclosure under Item 503(c).

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (Item 305)

Item 305 requires quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk sensitive
instruments that affect a registrant’s financial condition. 495 Item 305(a) requires registrants to
provide quantitative disclosure about market risk sensitive instruments using one or more of
three disclosure alternatives:
(1) Tabular presentation of fair value information and contract terms relevant to
determining future cash flows, categorized by expected maturity dates;
(2) Sensitivity analysis expressing the potential loss in future earnings, fair values, or
cash flows from selected hypothetical changes in market rates and prices; or
(3) Value at risk (“VaR”) disclosures expressing the potential loss in future earnings, fair
values, or cash flows from market movements over a selected period of time and with a
selected likelihood of occurrence. 496
Registrants are required to categorize market risk sensitive instruments into instruments
entered into for trading purposes and instruments entered into for purposes other than trading. 497
To the extent material, within both the trading and other than trading portfolios, registrants must
provide separate quantitative information for each market risk exposure category (e.g., interest
rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and other relevant market
risks, such as equity price risk). 498

495

Item 305 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.305]. For the purposes of Item 305(a) and (b), market risk sensitive
instruments include derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments, and derivative commodity
instruments. Each of these terms is defined in General Instruction 3 to Items 305(a) and (b). See Disclosure of

The 2012 Exposure Draft aimed to provide more useful information on exposures to liquidity risk and to
interest rate risk by requiring, among other things, tabular disclosure of liquidity risk related to financial assets
and financial liabilities or cash flow obligations, disaggregated by expected maturities; carrying amounts of
classes of financial assets and financial liabilities, segregated according to time intervals based on contractual
repricing; an interest rate sensitivity table showing the effects on net income and shareholder equity of specific
hypothetical shifts of interest rates; and quantitative or narrative disclosure as necessary to understand
exposures to liquidity risk and interest rate risk. For a discussion of the 2012 Exposure Draft, see Section

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. Several commenters noted that, while financial
reporting in accordance with evolving accounting standards has greatly expanded since the
adoption of Item 305, including the adoption of ASC Topic 815, Item 305 and other disclosure
requirements in Regulation S-K have not been revisited to identify and eliminate
redundancies. 504 One of these commenters suggested eliminating Item 305 in light of current
U.S. GAAP requirements, or, alternatively, re-focusing Item 305 to permit principles-based
disclosure of market risk. 505 Another commenter stated that improving market risk disclosures
should be a high priority and that there should be a better linkage among the financial statements
and other risk-related disclosure. 506 One commenter asserted that there is confusion in the
marketplace about what specific disclosure is required under Item 305. 507 Another commenter
stated that updating Item 305 should be a “central aspect” of disclosure effectiveness efforts and
included specific suggestions for revisions, including improving VaR. 508 Though not

See, e.g., CCMC (noting that ASC Topic 815 provides substantial guidance about hedge accounting and also
stating there is some redundancy between Item 305 and Item 303, evidenced by the fact that some public
companies do not provide stand-alone disclosure in response to Item 305); SCSGP (noting overlap between
certain market risk disclosures required by S-K Item 305, ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements, and ASC 815
Derivatives and Hedging); ABA 2.

505

See ABA 2 (citing ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging and suggesting
that any such principles-based disclosure of market risk could be included in MD&A). The degree of overlap
between Item 305 and U.S. GAAP depends on which of Item 305’s presentations is chosen and on whether
information that is encouraged to be provided by ASC 820, including qualitative disclosure on risk
management, is actually provided. Using a tabular presentation under Item 305 generally results in greater
overlap with ASC 820 and ASC 815. Item 305 also requires that disclosure be made outside the financial
statement footnotes.

506

See CFA Institute. This commenter did not provide a suggestion as to how to better link financial statement
disclosures with risk-related disclosure provided elsewhere in a filing.

507

See CCMC. This commenter stated Item 305 is “one of the most complicated disclosure requirements to parse
in all of Regulation S-K.”

508

See Hu. In research cited in the comment letter, this commenter perceived three problems with Item 305’s VaR
presentation: (i) too much “latitude as to (a) the models, assumptions, and parameters used, as well as (b) the
confidence level and time horizon [registrants can] choose to report at;” (ii) no evidence as to the quality of the
VaR model is required; and (iii) VaR “is not intended to gauge possible losses in times of high economic
stress.” See Henry T. C. Hu, Disclosure Universes and Modes of Information: Banks, Innovation, and
Divergent Regulatory Quests, 31 Yale J. on Reg. 565, 598 (2014) (“Hu 2014”).

Discussion

i.

Disclosure Objective

The adequacy of market risk disclosure emerged as an important financial reporting issue
in the 1990s following a substantial increase in the use of derivatives and other instruments
subject to market risk and the significant, sometimes unexpected, losses registrants experienced
from their use of these instruments. 510 The Commission adopted Item 305 in 1997 to improve
disclosures about market risk and help investors better understand and evaluate a registrant’s
market risk exposures. 511 The required disclosures were also intended, where applicable, to
provide a mechanism for registrants to disclose that their use of derivatives represents risk
management rather than speculation. 512
To achieve these goals, the Commission used the following guiding principles in
adopting Item 305:
•

Disclosures should make transparent the impact of derivatives on a registrant’s
statements of financial position, cash flows, and results of operations;

509

See AFL-CIO. As an example of common exposures, this commenter cited credit triggers under swaps
contracts where “banks may require companies to fully collateralize credit exposures under certain conditions.”

510

See Disclosure of Market Risk Sensitive Instruments Release.

511

See id. In conjunction with adopting Item 305, the Commission amended Rule 4-08 of Regulation S-X and
Item 310 of Regulation S-B, which is no longer in effect, to require enhanced descriptions of accounting
policies for derivatives in the footnotes to the financial statements. These revisions were designed to address
footnote disclosures of accounting policies that were often too general to convey adequately the diversity in
accounting that exists for derivatives. In contrast to Item 305, which applies to all financial instruments, the
new disclosure requirements under Rule 4-08 and Item 310 applied only to derivatives; disclosure requirements
for other financial instruments were addressed by existing U.S. GAAP and Commission guidance. Id. (citing
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 22 (April 1972)). SRCs are not required to provide Item 305
information. Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.305(e)].

•

Disclosures should provide information about a registrant’s exposures to market risk;

•

Disclosures should explain how market risk sensitive instruments are used in the context
of the registrant’s business;

•

Disclosures about market risk exposures should not focus on derivatives in isolation, but
rather should reflect the risk of loss inherent in all market risk sensitive instruments;

•

Market risk disclosure requirements should be flexible enough to accommodate different
types of registrants, different degrees of market risk exposure, and alternative ways of
measuring market risk;

•

Disclosures about market risk should address, where appropriate, special risks relating to
leverage, option, or prepayment features; and

•

New disclosure requirements should build on existing requirements, where possible, to
minimize compliance costs. 513
Item 305 was designed to address concerns that market risks associated with derivatives

and other market-sensitive instruments were not adequately disclosed. 514 In the adopting release
for Item 305, the Commission noted that disclosure about reported items in the footnotes to the
financial statements, MD&A, schedules and selected financial data may not have adequately
reflected the effect of derivatives on such reported items. 515 In addition, disclosures about
different types of market risk sensitive instruments were often reported separately, making it
difficult to assess a registrant’s aggregate market risk exposures. 516 Accordingly, Item 305 was
513

514

See id. The disclosure issues were noted as part of the staff’s review of more than 500 annual reports in 1994

risk disclosure. See id.

intended to help investors understand a registrant’s risk management activities and to help place
those activities in the context of the registrant’s business by requiring enhanced disclosure about
specific market risk sensitive instruments. 517
Division staff has observed that the instructions to Item 305 may inadvertently discourage
some disclosure. For example, a sensitivity analysis requires disclosure of the potential loss to
the future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from a
hypothetical change in rates or prices. 518 The instructions to Item 305(a) state that registrants
should select hypothetical changes in market rates or prices that are expected to reflect
reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates and prices; however, absent economic
justification for the selection of a different amount, “registrants should use changes that are not
less than ten percent of end of period market rates or prices.” 519 Many registrants apply the ten
percent threshold even when market conditions, such as persistently low interest rates or volatile
exchange rates, may suggest that a different threshold, or even multiple thresholds, would be
more appropriate. 520
Considering commenters’ differing views on the efficacy of Item 305 and the complexity
of Item 305’s required disclosures, we seek input on whether, and how, changes to Item 305
would be beneficial to both investors and registrants.

For example, the prime rate in the U.S. has been 3.5% or 3.25% for a number of months. See
http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3020-moneyrate.html?mod=mdc_bnd_pglnk. Many registrants
present their interest rate risk under the sensitivity analysis showing only a shift of 10% of this amount, or 35 or
33 (rounded) basis points. Financial services and financial institution registrants, on the other hand, often
provide analyses of various shifts in interest rates and evaluate shifts of 50, 100, and 200 basis points, both up
and down. This more comprehensive presentation may provide investors with a better understanding of how
various shifts in market risk, both more moderate and more pronounced, might impact the registrant.

Request for Comment

157. Is Item 305 effective in eliciting disclosure about market risks and risk management
practices that investors consider important? If not, how could Item 305 be
improved?
158. Does Item 305 result in information that allows investors to effectively assess (1) a
registrant’s aggregate market risk exposure, and (2) the impact of market risk
sensitive instruments on a registrant’s results of operations and financial condition?
If not, how could we revise Item 305 to achieve these goals?
159. Do the disclosure alternatives in Item 305(a) elicit adequate quantitative disclosure
about market risk? Do the rules or the instructions discourage registrants from fully
evaluating and disclosing their market risk exposures, such as in a sensitivity

revise the rules and instructions to Item 305(a)?
160. Should additional or different principles guide the market risk disclosure
requirements? Should we expand our definition of “market risk sensitive
instruments” to require registrants to provide additional disclosure about other risks,
including credit risk, liquidity and funding risk and operational risk?
161. Should we limit the quantitative disclosure requirement to certain registrants such
as financial institutions or registrants engaged in financial services? Why or why
not?

required by Item 305?

administrative and compliance costs of preparing and disseminating this disclosure?
How would these costs change if we made any of the changes contemplated here?
Please provide quantified estimates where possible and include only those costs
associated with providing disclosure under Item 305.

Disclosure Alternatives and Coordination with Financial Statement
Disclosures

Item 305(a) specifies three disclosure alternatives for registrants to present quantitative
information about market risk: tabular disclosure, sensitivity analysis, and VaR. 521 In adopting
Item 305, the Commission recognized the evolving nature of market risk sensitive instruments,
market risk measurement systems, and market risk management strategies. 522 The Commission
stated that it expected to “continue considering how best to meet the information needs of
investors.” 523 Accordingly, we are seeking input on whether and how we should revise Item 305
to reflect changes in market risk exposures and methods for measuring market risk.
In response to the proposing release for Item 305, some commenters suggested greater
flexibility and recommended a “management approach” to disclosure. As suggested by the
commenters, this disclosure would focus on the information and methods that management
actually uses internally to evaluate, monitor, and manage market risk. 524 The Commission did
not adopt this approach, believing that a presentation of market risk using a management

See id. at 6046.

524

See id. at 6055. Commenters believed that “the approaches in the proposing release (i) do not appear to allow
gap and duration analyses, which are currently used by some to measure market risk, and (ii) may become
outdated as new measurement approaches are developed in the market place.” Id. at 6055.

162

approach outside of the framework articulated in Item 305 could make it difficult for investors to
assess market risk across registrants. 525 We are interested in whether a “management approach”
to disclosure is preferable to the alternatives specified in the current rule.
We are also interested in whether we should modify Item 305 given accounting
developments since the item’s adoption. When the Commission adopted Item 305 in 1997,
minimal authoritative literature on the accounting for options and complex derivatives existed. 526
Since that time, accounting requirements have evolved to provide for greater disclosure of
market risk sensitive instruments. 527 As a result, there may be redundancies between the
disclosure provided in response to Item 305 and U.S. GAAP. Commission staff has observed
that, the degree of repetition in the disclosure depends on which Item 305 disclosure alternative a
registrant utilizes and whether a registrant provides information that is encouraged by U.S.
GAAP in addition to the disclosure that is required. 528
Item 305 disclosure also tends to vary among registrants. Many registrants provide a
sensitivity analysis to present market risk information, while others rely on tabular presentation
or VaR. For large financial institutions, it is not unusual to use some combination of the three to
capture different market risk sensitive instruments.

525

See id. The Commission noted that, in adopting Item 305, it sought to strike a balance between those seeking a
“management approach” and those supporting a more consistent reporting framework for the sake of
comparability. See id.

FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, May 2011, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). ASC 820
requires the disclosure of fair value of all financial instruments, including derivatives and non-derivative
financial instruments, but does not require any expected maturity information.

528

For example, ASC 815 encourages but does not require that disclosure about a registrant’s objectives and
strategies for using derivatives be described in the context of the entity’s overall risk exposures. The standard
indicates that if these additional qualitative disclosures are made, they should include a discussion of those risk
exposures even though the registrant does not manage some of those risk exposures using derivatives.

Request for Comment

164. How have standard risk management practices and methods of reporting market risk
evolved since the adoption of Item 305 in 1997? Should we revise Item 305 to
reflect those changes and if so, how? Should we provide for new disclosure
alternatives in addition to, or in lieu of, existing alternatives?
165. What revisions should we consider to better link disclosure that identifies,
quantifies, and analyzes a registrant’s material market risks to its: (a) market risk
sensitive instruments, (b) financial statements, (c) capital adequacy, and (d) any
other metrics important to an understanding of market risk exposures?
166. Should we eliminate the prescribed disclosure alternatives and allow registrants to
discuss market risk according to the methods used by management to manage the
risk? Would allowing a “management approach” provide investors with more
insight about the way management actually assesses market risks, or would this
approach unduly hinder investors’ ability to compare market risk disclosures across
registrants?
167. Is the disclosure required by Item 305 repetitive of the disclosure required by U.S.
GAAP and Rule 4-08 of Regulation S-X? Conversely, does Item 305 result in
disclosure that is important to investors and is not found elsewhere in a registrant’s
filing? Even considering any repetition, do investors benefit from disclosure about
market risk exposure outside of the audited financial statements?

164

iii.

Comparability of Disclosure

In adopting Item 305, the Commission acknowledged the tension between approaches to
market risk disclosure that favor comparability and approaches that favor flexibility. 529 The
approach taken in the final rules sought to strike a balance between different commenters’
perspectives. 530
The Commission designed Item 305 to be flexible by prescribing three disclosure
alternatives without stipulating standardized methods and procedures specifying how to comply
with each alternative. 531 Registrants may choose which methods, model characteristics,
assumptions, and parameters they use in complying with the item, and registrants may use more
than one disclosure alternative across each market risk exposure category. 532
To address comparability, the Commission included a requirement that registrants
describe the characteristics of the model and the assumptions used to prepare the quantitative
market risk disclosures. By requiring a description of the model and its assumptions, the
Commission intended to assist investors in evaluating the potential effect of variations in the
model’s characteristics and assumptions. 533

529

See Disclosure of Market Risk Sensitive Instruments Release at 6048 (“The Commission has provided
flexibility in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements…even though such flexibility is likely to
reduce the comparability of disclosures.”).

530

See id.

531

See id. For example, the terms used to describe two of the three disclosure alternatives – “sensitivity analysis”
and “value at risk” – describe a general class of models. They are not meant to refer to any one model for
quantifying market risk. In addition, Item 305 permits registrants to change disclosure alternatives or key
model characteristics, assumptions, and parameters used in providing quantitative information about market
risk, with disclosure if the effects of such a change are material. The Commission also noted that two methods
of measuring market risk then in use, gap analysis and duration analysis, would, with minor revisions, satisfy
the tabular and sensitivity analysis disclosure requirements respectively. Id.

532

In 2012, the FASB examined the question of comparability and considered standardizing
liquidity and interest rate risk disclosure as part of a project that is currently in Exposure Draft
form. 534 The Exposure Draft would have required all reporting entities to provide standardized
quantitative disclosure about liquidity risk, but only financial institutions would have been
required to provide additional, standardized quantitative disclosure about interest rate risk.
Although initiated, in part, as a response to comments received from financial statement
users to an earlier FASB release on financial statements, the majority of respondents to the
Exposure Draft, eighty-four percent of whom were preparers, did not support the proposed
disclosures. 535 Most respondents stated that standardizing information about liquidity and
interest rate risk is not appropriate and not achieved by the proposals. 536 Some commenters
questioned whether standardization is an appropriate objective and if it could ever be
achieved. 537

534

See Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2012-200 Disclosure about Liquidity Risk and Interest Rate Risk Financial Instruments (Topic 825), Financial Accounting Standards Board (Issued June 27, 2012), available at
http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176160135003.
This Exposure Draft was partly in response to demand by users for audited, standardized, and consistent
disclosures by public companies. The Exposure draft noted that, as part of a May 2010 proposed Accounting
Standards Update (Accounting for Financial Instruments and Revisions to the Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities—Financial Instruments (Topic 825) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815)), the FASB performed extensive outreach and received feedback that the risks inherent in a class of
financial instruments and the way in which an entity manages those risks through its business operations should
be instrumental in developing the reporting model for financial instruments. The important risks identified by
users of financial statements during the FASB’s outreach efforts were credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate
risk. See also supra note 503.

See id. These respondents also asserted that institutions are required by regulation to ensure that risks are
monitored using processes that are commensurate with the complexity of their business. See id.

537

loan portfolios, such as prepayment rates relating to the expected behavior of the counterparty, and that the
underlying assumptions made for each of those estimates will not be consistent among entities. See id.

(a)

Request for Comment

168. Should we revise Item 305 to provide for more standardized disclosure that would
enhance comparability among registrants? How should we balance standardization
with different methods and assumptions that registrants may use to evaluate,
monitor, and manage market risk? How would standardization affect investors and
registrants?
3.

Disclosure of Approach to Risk Management and Risk Management Process

Item 503(c) focuses exclusively on disclosure of significant risks and does not address
disclosure of a registrant’s strategy for managing risk. Item 305(b), however, requires disclosure
about a registrant’s primary market risks and how those risks are managed. In the past,
Commission staff has discouraged registrants from including mitigating language in their Item
503 risk factor disclosure because of concern that mitigating language could dilute investors’
perception of the magnitude of the risk. As a result, registrants typically do not discuss their
efforts to mitigate risk in connection with their risk factors disclosure, although some registrants
describe their risk management practices elsewhere in their filings, such as in MD&A and as
required by Item 305 for market risk.
Disclosure about a registrant’s approach to risk management could enhance investor
understanding of the possible impact of a disclosed risk and the registrant’s overall risk profile.
Division staff has observed that most large financial institutions have implemented enterprise
risk management programs and currently include detailed disclosure about those programs in
their filings. Additional disclosure about changes to, or significant deviations from, the stated
policies could provide investors with important information about the registrant’s exposure to

167

risk. 538 Registrants that do not provide disclosure about a formal enterprise risk management
program may instead provide disclosure about management’s general approach to risk
management as well as specific efforts to mitigate individual significant risks.
We are mindful of the potential drawbacks of requiring registrants to provide risk
management or risk mitigation disclosure. Disclosure of management’s efforts to mitigate risk
may suggest to investors that the registrant’s risk exposure is not significant. In addition, risk
management strategies could include confidential or proprietary information and disclosure
could result in competitive harm to the registrant. For example, a registrant may develop and
rely on a proprietary method for hedging financial risk, and disclosure of the method could allow
others to exploit or trade against the method such that it is no longer effective or becomes too
expensive. 539
a.

Request for Comment

169. Should we require registrants to describe their risk management processes? If so,
what level of detail would be appropriate? If a registrant has no formal risk
management approach or process, should we require it to describe how it monitors
and evaluates risk?
170. Should we require registrants also to describe their assessment of any risk
management process? If so, how often should such disclosure be required?
538

For an example of a registrant deviating from its stated risk management policies, see Report of Anton R.
Valukas, Examiner, In Re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., et al., Vol. I at 167-168 (discussing evidence that
management disregarded its risk controls with respect to bridge equity and bridge debt).

539

Commission concern for protecting proprietary strategies in connection with Item 305 disclosures is reflected in
four provisions addressing proprietary concerns. See Disclosure of Market Risk Sensitive Instruments Release.
The four provisions are: (i) the sensitivity analysis and VaR alternatives for quantitative information; (ii) the
option to report average, high, and low sensitivity analysis and VaR instead of year end information; (iii) for
interim reports, the need for disclosure of material changes since the end of the most recent fiscal year; and (iv)
requiring a combined, not separate, sensitivity or VaR disclosures for voluntarily disclosed instruments,
positions, or transactions.

168

171. Should we require registrants with complex risk management approaches or
processes to provide only an enterprise-level description, or is a more granular
description appropriate for these registrants?
172. Should we require registrants to disclose when risk tolerance limits or other
fundamental aspects of its risk management approach are waived or changed,
including any assumptions or relevant changes in business strategy that underlies
the new limits or policies?
173. Should we require registrants to identify, if material, other “primary risk exposures”
not already addressed and to disclose actions taken to manage those risks?
174. How could we facilitate a more integrated discussion of risk exposure and risk
mitigation? Should we require registrants to disclose management’s view of how
material risk exposures are related and how risk mitigation actions are connected?
175. To the extent we require disclosure of risk management and risk management
processes, should we move the disclosure about the extent of a board of directors’
oversight of risk from Item 407(h) to this new requirement? Similarly, should we
move compensation risk disclosure to this new requirement, or should we otherwise
provide an option for compensation risk disclosure to be given in the risk
management discussion rather than in the compensation discussion?
176. Should we require registrants to disclose their efforts to manage or mitigate each
risk factor disclosed, similar to the risk management disclosure required for market
risk under Item 305(b)(1)(ii)? What are the challenges, including those associated
with preparation and competitive harm, with this disclosure?

169

177. Would additional disclosure about risk mitigation inhibit investors’ ability to fully
appreciate the significance of the risk? Would requiring a registrant to explain how
it addresses a disclosed risk discourage registrants from disclosing generic or
insignificant risks? Alternatively, would registrants provide boilerplate disclosure
about how they address less meaningful risks, thereby resulting in even longer risk
factor disclosure?
178. Should we require registrants to address mitigation or management of each risk
factor as part of the risk management discussion? If so, should we also clarify that,
although references to the general risk management discussion will not satisfy this
requirement, cross-references to appropriate portions of MD&A or the financial
statements will, if disclosure otherwise would be redundant?
179. Should we require registrants to disclose their known uncertainties about their risk
management and risk management policies and how these might affect the
registrant?
4.

Consolidating Risk-Related Disclosure

Outside of Items 503(c) and 305, a number of Items in Regulation S-K elicit risk-related
disclosures. These include Item 103, related to material litigation and certain environmental
proceedings; Item 101(d)(3), in connection with risk related to foreign operations; Item 303(a),
in that material trends, uncertainties, or events that are required to be described may also speak to
certain risks; and Item 407(h), regarding the extent of a board’s role in risk oversight. In the S-K
Study, the staff recommended that we consider whether to consolidate requirements relating to
risk factors, legal proceedings, and other quantitative and qualitative information about risk and

170

risk management into a single requirement. 540 We seek input on whether investors would benefit
from such a consolidation of risk-related disclosures and whether such a requirement would
present any challenges to registrants.

Securities of the Registrant

Disclosure about a registrant’s capital stock and transactions by registrants in their own
securities helps inform investment and voting decisions by providing investors with information
about a security that can be useful in assessing its value. Several items in Regulation S-K require
this and related disclosure about a registrant’s securities:
•

Item 202 requires a description of the terms and conditions of securities that are being
registered; 543

•

Item 701 requires disclosure of recent sales of unregistered securities and use of
proceeds from registered offerings of securities; 544 and

•

Item 703 requires tabular disclosure of shares of equity securities purchased by the
registrant and affiliated purchasers. 545

Additionally, Item 201(b)(1) requires disclosure of the number of holders of each class of a
registrant’s common equity. 546 We are seeking public input on the disclosure requirements of
Items 201(b)(1), 547 202, 701 and 703 to help assess whether any of the disclosure requirements
should be modified and whether we should add any new disclosure requirements. In addition,
we welcome comment on the challenges for registrants related to complying with these
disclosure requirements or any new disclosure requirements.

Item 202 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.202]. Item 202 disclosure is not required in Forms 10-Q or 10-K.

information, the effect of an offering or business combination on shareholder ownership, dividends and
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans. For a description of this project, see
Section I. Item 201(e) (performance graph) falls outside the scope of this release because this disclosure is
required only in proxy statements.

Related Stockholder Matters – Number of Equity Holders (Item 201(b))

Item 201(b)(1) requires disclosure of the approximate number of holders of each class of

number of holders may be based upon the number of record holders or also may include
individual participants in security position listings, as provided under Rule 17Ad-8 549 of the

shall be indicated.

Discussion

Several decades ago, most investors of U.S. publicly traded registrants owned their
securities in registered form, meaning that the securities were directly registered in the name of a
specific investor on the record of security holders maintained by or on behalf of the registrant.

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-8 [17 CFR 240.17Ad-8]. The rule defines “securities position listing,” with respect to
the securities of any issuer held by a registered clearing agency in the name of the clearing agency or its
nominee, as a list of those participants in the clearing agency on whose behalf the clearing agency holds the
issuer’s securities and of the participants’ respective positions in such securities as of a specified date. The rule
also states that, upon request, a registered clearing agency must furnish a securities position listing promptly to
each issuer whose securities are held in the name of the clearing agency or its nominee.

173

Today, the vast majority of investors own their securities as a beneficial owner 552 through a
securities intermediary, 553 such as a broker-dealer or bank. 554 This is often referred to as holding
securities in nominee or “street name.” The Commission first adopted a requirement to disclose
the number of record holders of a class of securities in 1938, when it adopted the requirement
that registrants submit proxy statements to each shareholder whose proxy is being solicited. 555
In 1964, the Commission proposed amending Form 10-K to require registrants to
disclose, in addition to the number of record holders, the amount of each class of equity
securities known by the registrant to be held “in street names.” 556 Commenters generally
opposed the proposal on the grounds that the required information would be difficult to obtain
and of little use to investors, and the Commission decided not to require disclosure of this

552

We recognize the term “beneficial owner” and “beneficial ownership” are defined in certain of our rules, such
as under Exchange Act Rules 13d-3, 16a-1 and 14b-2. Our use of the term here is not intended to suggest that
individuals holding in “street name” are, or should be, “beneficial owners” for purposes of these Exchange Act
rules. [17 CFR 240.13d-3; 17 CFR 240.16a-1; 17 CFR 240.14b-2].

553

For purposes of Commission rules pertaining to the transfer of certain securities, a “securities intermediary” is
defined under Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-20 [17 CFR 240.17Ad-20] as a clearing agency registered under
Exchange Act Section 17A [15 U.S.C. 78q-1] or a person, including a bank, broker, or dealer, that in the
ordinary course of its business maintains securities accounts for others in its capacity as such.

554

In 1976, the Commission reported to Congress on the effects of the practice of registering securities in other
than the name of the beneficial owner. In its report the Commission stated that 23.7% of shares were held in
nominee and street name in 1964 and 28.6% of shares were held in nominee and street name in 1975. Final
Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on the Practice of Recording the Ownership of Securities in
the Records of the Issuer in Other than the Name of the Beneficial Owner of Such Securities Pursuant to Section
12(m) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Dec. 3, 1976. Based on an analysis of available data over the
period 2008 through 2010, the Commission’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (“DERA”) estimates
that over 85% of the holders of securities in the U.S. markets hold through a broker-dealer or a bank that is a
DTC participant. More recently, and according to one study, shares held in street name continue to account for
over 80% of all shares outstanding of U.S. publicly listed companies. See PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Proxy
Pulse, Third Edition 2015 at 8.

555

See Amended Proxy Rules, Release No. 34-1823 (Aug. 11, 1938) [3 FR 1991 (Aug. 13, 1938)]. This rule
required registrants to furnish, upon written request of the record holder being solicited, the approximate
number of record holders of any specified class of securities of which any of the holders had been or were being
solicited.

information. 557 In 1980, the Commission adopted Item 4 to Form 10-K, which consolidated
disclosures relating to the market for the registrant’s securities, including the number of holders
of common stock, into a single item. 558 As adopted, Item 4 to Form 10-K integrated the
disclosure requirements of a new Item 9 in Regulation S-K, which the Commission adopted
concurrently. 559
Item 201(b)’s reference to record holders is consistent with Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act. Section 12(g) requires issuers that are not banks, bank holding companies or
savings and loan holding companies and have total assets exceeding $10 million to register a
class of equity securities if the securities were “held of record” by either (i) 2,000 persons, or (ii)
500 persons who are not accredited investors. 560 When Congress enacted Section 12(g) in 1964,
most security holders in the United States owned their securities as record holders.

Item 202 derives from Schedule A of the Securities Act, which requires disclosure of the
capitalization of the registrant, including a description of the classes of capital stock and funded
debt and any securities covered by options. 562 These requirements were included in the earliest
forms of registration statements. 563 As part of revision and simplification efforts in 1947, the

established trading market for such securities, registrants are required to provide market information for such
securities comparable to that required by Item 201(a) of Regulation S-K. The staff is separately considering

Commission amended this requirement to eliminate the description of securities that are not
being registered, except to the extent material to an evaluation of the securities being
registered. 564 In 1982, Item 202 was included in Regulation S-K 565 as part of the “offeringoriented items” 566 and is currently required only in registration statements and some proxy
statements. 567
While registrants are required to file as exhibits complete copies of their articles of
incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect, registrants are not required to describe these
documents or their registered securities in their periodic filings. 568 A summary description of the
material terms and conditions of the registrant’s securities, as provided under Item 202, is not
required in periodic reports and most registrants do not include such disclosure. To find this
information, investors typically must locate this disclosure either in the registrant’s exhibits, as
amended, or in the registrant’s Form 8-A, which often incorporates by reference from a prior
Form S-1.
Changes in the terms and conditions of registered securities are disclosed in Form 8-K
and Schedule 14A, which require discussion of modifications to the rights of any class of

incorporation or bylaws may be limited to the text of the amendment, however, the registrant
must file a complete copy of the articles of incorporation or bylaws with its next Securities Act

comprehensive discussion of registered securities in periodic reports would facilitate access to
important disclosure for investors in the secondary market.

Comments Received

S-K Study. Two commenters stated that disclosure of Item 701 information is not
meaningful for investors. 573 They also stated that such disclosure should not be required in
registration statements because, to the extent recent sales of securities are material to investors,
registrants would be required to disclose that information in their discussion of liquidity and
capital resources under MD&A pursuant to Items 303(a)(1) and (2). 574
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter recommended that the disclosure of
sales of unregistered securities be limited to sales that are material to the issuer. 575 This
commenter also suggested reconciling the disclosure requirements of Item 701, which requires
disclosure of all unregistered sales of common equity, with those of Item 3.02 of Form 8-K,
which does not require disclosure of sales of less than one percent of the number of shares
outstanding of the equity securities being sold. Another commenter recommended eliminating
Item 701, noting overlap with Form 8-K and also stating that, for a material sale of securities,
registrants typically discuss the transaction in MD&A. 576

b.

Discussion

Item 701’s requirement to disclose recent sales of unregistered securities is based, in part,
on Schedule A. 577 A disclosure requirement in Form S-1 578 of sales of unregistered securities for
the past three years predated Regulation S-K. 579 The requirement was moved to Regulation S-K
in connection with adoption of the integrated disclosure system, but it continued to apply only to
certain registration statements. 580
In 1996, the Commission adopted amendments to require timely disclosure of
unregistered equity offerings and amended Forms 10-K and 10-Q to include Item 701(a)-(e). 581
This amendment was intended to address concerns that unregistered offerings were frequently
undisclosed and such offerings could materially affect the financial condition of registrants or
result in significant dilution to existing shareholders. 582 The Commission also expanded Item

577

Paragraph 19 of Schedule A of the Securities Act is broader than Item 701 because it calls for the net proceeds
derived from any security sold by the issuer during the two years preceding the filing of the registration
statement, including the price at which such security was offered. See Securities Act of 1933 Schedule A
Paragraph 19 [15 U.S.C. 77aa(19)]. Other differences include Item 701’s three-year timeframe, as opposed to
two years in Schedule A, and the fact that Item 701 is limited to unregistered sales of equity securities while
Schedule A contains neither of these limitations.

Regulation S-K). See also 1980 Proposed Revisions (noting that the requirement to disclose sales of
unregistered securities during the past three years in proposed Form C was the same as in Item 25 of Form S-1
at that time).

580

See 1982 Integrated Disclosure Adopting Release. When Item 701 was moved to Regulation S-K, this
disclosure was required in Forms 10-Q, S-1, S-11 and 10. The Commission had adopted a similar requirement
for Forms 10-K and 10-Q in 1972. See Adoption of Amendments to Annual Report Form 10-K and Quarterly
Report Form 10-Q Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Release No. 34-9443 (Jan. 10, 1972) [37 FR
601 (Jan. 14, 1972)]. The Commission eliminated this requirement from Form 10-K in 1980, consistent with
recommendations by the Sommer Report. See 1980 Form 10-K Adopting Release. According to the Sommer
Report, the requirement was unnecessary in Form 10-K because the same information was available in the
financial statements and required to be disclosed in Form 10-Q. See Sommer Report at 486.

exchangeable equity securities. 583
In 2004, the Commission sought more timely disclosure of unregistered equity offerings
and added Item 3.02 to Form 8-K. Item 3.02 requires registrants to disclose, within four business
days, 584 the information specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) through (e) of Item 701 585 when
aggregate equity securities sold are equal to or exceed one percent of the number of shares
outstanding of the class of equity securities sold. 586 The Commission initially proposed to move
the Item 701 disclosure requirement out of Forms 10-Q and 10-K and into Form 8-K. 587 This
proposal was based on the Commission’s belief that more timely disclosure of this information
would benefit investors due to the potentially significant dilutive effect on existing investors’
holdings. 588 In response to comments on the proposing release, the Commission adopted the one
percent threshold for disclosure on Form 8-K, noting that registrants would still be required to

See id. The Commission solicited comment on whether there was value to requiring the “aggregate listing” of

The Commission also solicited comment on the question of whether the Form 8-K disclosure should be limited

outstanding shares or a percentage of the company’s market float. See id. at 42923.

report all other unregistered sales of equity securities in their periodic reports. 589 Concurrently,
the Commission revised Forms 10-K and 10-Q to require disclosure only of unregistered sales of
equity securities not previously disclosed on Form 8-K. 590
Some of the disclosure required by Item 701(a)-(e) may overlap with disclosure in the
statement of stockholders’ equity, which is required in the annual financial statements, 591 or in
the notes to the financial statements. For example, under U.S. GAAP, registrants must disclose
the number of shares sold, title of class of stock sold and net proceeds. 592 Registrants are also
required to discuss the rights and privileges of the securities outstanding, such as conversion or
exercise prices and pertinent dates. 593 On the other hand, U.S. GAAP does not require disclosure
of underwriters, underwriting discounts, the exemption claimed or the identity of the purchasers,
as required by Item 701. In addition, accounting standards do not distinguish between registered
and unregistered sales of securities.

percent an appropriate threshold? If not, what would be an appropriate threshold
and why?
193. Should we revise Forms 10-K and 10-Q to require disclosure of all unregistered
sales of securities during the reporting period, including those already reported on
Form 8-K? What would be the benefits to investors? Alternatively, should we
require registrants to cross-reference or include a hyperlink to any previously filed
Form 8-K containing Item 701 information for the reporting period or incorporate
such forms by reference? What would be the advantages or disadvantages
associated with either of these approaches?
194. Should we remove the Item 701 disclosure requirement from Forms 10-K and 10Q? If so, should we revise Item 3.02 of Form 8-K to remove the one percent
threshold and require registrants to disclose all unregistered sales of securities on
Form 8-K? Alternatively, should we eliminate Item 3.02 of Form 8-K and instead
require disclosure only in Forms 10-K and 10-Q?

Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities (Item 701(f))

Item 701(f) requires a registrant to disclose the use of proceeds from its first registered
offering. 594 The registrant must provide the following disclosure in its first Exchange Act
periodic report after effectiveness of the Securities Act registration statement:
•

the effective date of the Securities Act registration statement;

•

the offering date or an explanation of why the offering has not commenced;

•

if the offering terminated before any securities were sold, an explanation of the
termination;

•

if the offering did not terminate before any securities were sold, registrants must disclose
(i) whether the offering has terminated and, if so, whether it terminated before the sale of
all securities registered; (ii) the names of the managing underwriters, if any; (iii) the title
of each class of securities registered; (iv) for each class of securities, the amount
registered, the aggregate offering price of the amount registered, the amount sold, and the
aggregate offering price of the amount sold to date; (v) the amount of expenses incurred
by the registrant in connection with the issuance and distribution of the securities
registered; (vi) net offering proceeds after deducting expenses; (vii) the amount of net

any material change from the prospectus disclosure about the use of proceeds. 595
Item 701(f) requires registrants to provide disclosure in each subsequent periodic report
to the extent it has changed since the last periodic report filed. Registrants must continue to
provide this disclosure until the application of all of the offering proceeds or termination of the
offering.

Comments Received

S-K Study. Two commenters recommended eliminating Item 701(f), indicating the
requirement does not result in useful information for investors since companies cannot
necessarily determine whether a dollar spent was derived from revenue or from the net proceeds
of a securities offering, and that the discussion of cash flow in MD&A should already address
material uses of cash. 596

Discussion

The precursor to Item 701(f) originated in Rule 463 of the Securities Act, which was
adopted with related Form SR in 1971.597 In proposing this rule, the Commission noted that
disclosure about the progress of an offering of registered securities would enable the
Commission to know whether the registrant is required to file and use an updated Section
10(a)(3) prospectus and whether “dealers effecting transactions in the registered security must

(“Rule 463 Adopting Release”). Form SR was a stand-alone report required to be filed once every six months
following the effective date of a registrant’s first Securities Act registration statement.

186

furnish a copy of the prospectus to purchasers.” 598 The Commission further noted that, if
registrants have used offering proceeds for purposes different from those stated in the prospectus,
investors may have been misled as to the purposes for which the funds supplied by them would
be applied. Information about the actual use of proceeds following the offering would indicate
whether statements in the prospectus were borne out by the registrant’s subsequent actions. 599
In 1980, the Commission proposed revisions to Rule 463 and Form SR to require, among
other things, disclosure of use of proceeds beyond first-time registered offerings. 600 After
considering comments on the proposal, the Commission concluded it was not clear that the
benefits from such an extension would outweigh the additional reporting burdens imposed on
registrants. 601 At the same time, the Commission affirmed the use of Form SR for first-time
issuers and noted that commenters generally did not object to the use of Form SR to elicit
information about use of proceeds from first-time issuers. 602
In 1997, the Commission eliminated Form SR and adopted Item 701(f) to require
disclosure about the use of offering proceeds in periodic reports. 603 The Commission stated its
belief that relocating the disclosure to periodic reports would make it more accessible to

599

See id. As adopted, Rule 463 did not require a Form SR to be filed with respect to any offering of securities
issued by any investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; any public utility
company or public utility holding company required to file reports with any state or federal authority; or with
respect to American depositary receipts for foreign securities. See Rule 463 Adopting Release.

See Report of Sales of Securities, Release No. 33-6251 (Oct. 23, 1980) [45 FR 71811 (Oct. 30, 1980)]. The
proposed requirement was intended to facilitate the determination of whether an issuer of a direct distribution or
a best efforts underwritten offering that was not a first-time offering was complying with the prospectus
delivery and updating requirements of Sections 4(3) and 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act.

investors, since periodic reports were more commonly monitored by the public than Form SR. 604
The adoption of Item 701(f) led to use of proceeds information being reported on a quarterly
basis instead of semi-annually through Form SR.
Other disclosure requirements may elicit information about the use of offering proceeds.
For example, registrants may disclose the proceeds from initial public offerings as a material
source of cash in the liquidity discussion within MD&A. 605 Changes in a registrant’s statement
of cash flow and statement of stockholders’ equity in the financial statements may also indicate
the progress of its initial registered offering. However, certain information about the progress of
an offering, such as when a registrant has not commenced an offering or the offering is
terminated before any securities were sold, may not be available to investors outside of
disclosures required by Item 701(f).

Request for Comment

197. Should we retain or eliminate disclosure about the use of offering proceeds required
by Item 701(f)? Why? If we retain this requirement, how could we improve it?
For example, should we modify the item, such as by expanding it to offerings other
than a registrant’s first registered offering or by requiring other additional
disclosure? Why?
198. In Form 10-K, this disclosure is provided as part of Item 5 of Part II (Market for
Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities) while in Form 10-Q this disclosure is provided as Item 2 of Part
604

forms should ease reporting burdens on registrants by reducing the number of forms required to be filed.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers (Item
703)

Item 703 requires tabular disclosure of purchases of registered equity securities by the
registrant or any affiliated purchaser including:
•

total number of shares repurchased;

•

average price paid per share;

•

total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs; and

•

maximum number (or approximate dollar value) of shares that may yet be purchased
under the plans or programs. 606

Item 703 also requires footnote disclosure of (1) the date each plan or program was announced,
(2) the dollar amount (or share amount) approved, (3) the expiration date (if any) of each plan or
program, (4) each plan or program that has expired during the period covered by the table, and
(5) each plan or program the registrant has determined to terminate prior to expiration, or under
which the issuer does not intend to make further purchases. 607
Item 703 requires disclosure for each month included in the period covered by the report.

the FASB coordinate efforts to review and clarify the different disclosure objectives of Item 703

the FASB determine that the requirements are still useful, that they issue joint guidance on how
both requirements should work together.

repurchase programs by addressing, among other things, (i) the time period specified for each

cash (including any borrowings) spent on repurchases and dividends compared to that spent on
reinvestment, and (iv) the impact of repurchase programs on corporate indebtedness. 611 This
commenter also recommended that companies consider disclosing the sources of funds to finance
stock buybacks.

Discussion

In 2003, the Commission adopted Item 703 to increase the transparency of security
repurchases by registrants and their affiliates and to inform investors of registrants’ stated

repurchasing intentions and subsequent repurchases. 612 The Commission noted in the adopting
release that public announcement of a repurchase is often followed by a rise in the registrant’s
stock price, and that studies have shown some registrants publicly announce repurchase
programs but either do not repurchase shares or only repurchase a small portion of the publicly
disclosed amount. Item 703 was intended to inform investors whether, and to what extent,
registrants follow through on their original repurchase plans and to provide investors with
information that could affect a registrant’s stock price. 613
In recent years, stock repurchases by registrants have increased significantly. 614
According to media reports, since 2004 U.S. companies have spent nearly $7 trillion
repurchasing their own shares. 615 Common reasons for engaging in repurchases include
returning excess cash to shareholders, 616 boosting earnings per share 617 and offsetting share

dilution resulting from employee benefit plans. 618 Repurchases typically affect earnings per
share by reducing the amount of shares outstanding, 619 except when repurchased shares are
distributed to employees as compensation. Recent studies have found that, since the
Commission adopted Item 703, registrants have announced smaller open market repurchases 620
and have completed announced open market repurchases at a higher rate. 621
The staff has observed that registrants generally comply with the item requirements but
often do not analyze the impact of stock repurchases in the context of MD&A. Even when the
amount used to repurchase shares exceeds a registrant’s net income or cash generated from
operating activities for the reporting period, registrants do not always analyze these repurchases
in MD&A.
While some of the disclosure required under Item 703 overlaps with requirements under
U.S. GAAP, 622 there are differences between the two standards. Item 703 disclosure is required

The dollar amount and the number of shares repurchased are disclosed in the annual Statement of Shareholders’
Equity, because U.S. GAAP requires the repurchase of stock to be deducted from capital stock, additional paidin capital, and retained earnings. See ASC Topics 505-10-50, 505-30-30 and Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X.

on a quarterly basis while U.S. GAAP requires annual disclosure. Additionally, disclosure
requirements under U.S. GAAP vary depending on the type of transaction through which shares
are repurchased, and in some situations U.S. GAAP disclosures are more extensive than those
required under Item 703. 623 Disclosure provided under U.S. GAAP is also audited, unlike Item
703 disclosure. Typically, registrants provide disclosure about share repurchases in both the
notes to the financial statement and in non-financial statement disclosures.
While Item 703 requires disclosure of all monthly repurchases on a quarterly basis, 624
other jurisdictions require this disclosure more frequently. 625 We seek comment on whether we
should require more frequent or more granular information about repurchases or whether the
current disclosure requirements are sufficient.

Request for Comment

199. Is the information required under Item 703 about repurchases of a registrant’s
equity securities important to investors? If so, are there any revisions we could
make to Item 703 to improve the disclosure provided to investors?
200. Should we require more granular information on repurchases of a registrant’s equity
securities? If so, what additional detail or more granular information should we

This financial statement presents shareholders’ equity activity in a roll forward of each of the shareholders’
equity components from the beginning to the end of the annual period. Article 10 of Regulation S-X does not
require an interim period statement of shareholders equity. Instead, Rule 10-01(a)(5) requires disclosure of
events subsequent to the end of the most recent fiscal year that have occurred which have a material impact on
the registrant.
623

For example, for shares repurchased through accelerated share repurchase programs, registrants must disclose
the nature and terms of the arrangement with the seller from which the registrant is acquiring its shares,
including the number of shares subject to the contract, per share price terms and settlement options available.
See ASC Topic 815-40-50-5.

624

See Item 2(c) of Part II of Form 10-Q and Item 5(c) of Form 10-K.

For example, exchange listing requirements in Australia require disclosure of share repurchases by the next
business day. See Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rule 3.8A, available at

require? For example, should we require disclosure about incurrence of
indebtedness to fund repurchases or the impact repurchases had on performance
measures, such as earnings per share or other items? If so, how should this
information be formatted and presented?
201. Does Item 703 provide important information that is not also disclosed in a
registrant’s financial statements? Are there benefits to investors in providing this
information in both the financial statements and in non-financial statement
disclosure?
202. Item 703 requires disclosure of all repurchases of registered securities and does not
have a de minimis requirement. Do investors find disclosure of all repurchases of
securities during a registrant’s fiscal quarter important to making a voting or
investment decision? Should we adopt a general materiality standard or specify a
monetary threshold for Item 703 disclosure in periodic reports?
203. Item 703 disclosure is required on a quarterly basis, while relevant U.S. GAAP
disclosure is required on an annual basis. Should we require more frequent Item
703 disclosure? If so, what timeframe for reporting repurchases would be
appropriate?
204. Should we require registrants to report repurchases on Form 8-K? For example,
should we require Form 8-K disclosure only of repurchases that exceed a certain
threshold, similar to Item 3.02 of Form 8-K, which requires registrants to disclose
sales of equity securities that constitute more than one percent of the shares
outstanding of the class of equity securities? If so, what should this threshold be
and why?

Industry Guides

The Industry Guides express the disclosure policies and practices of the Division and are
intended to assist registrants and their counsel in preparing disclosure for their filings. 626
Currently, there are five Industry Guides that address disclosures by: (i) bank holding
companies, 627 (ii) oil and gas programs, 628 (iii) real estate limited partnerships, 629 (iv) propertycasualty insurance underwriters, 630 and (v) mining companies. 631 All five of the Industry Guides

626

Although the Commission published the Industry Guides, they do not constitute Commission rules and instead
are statements of staff policy. See Rescission of Guides and Redesignation of Industry Guides, Release No. 336384 (Mar. 3, 1982) [47 FR 11476 (Mar. 16, 1982)] (“Industry Guide Release”) (“These guides remain as an
expression of the policies and practices of the Division of Corporation Finance and their status is unaffected by

Securities Act and Exchange Act Industry Guide 3 – Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.
Industry Guide 3 was first published in 1976 as Securities Act Guide 61 and Exchange Act Industry Guide 3.
See Guides for Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies, Release No. 33-5735 (Aug. 31, 1976) [41
FR 39007 (Sept. 14, 1976)]. There have been only minor revisions to the text of Industry Guide 3 since its redesignation as an Industry Guide in 1982. Revisions relating to non-performing loan disclosure requirements
were implemented in 1983, and revisions relating to exposures to borrowers in certain foreign countries were
implemented in 1986. See Revision of Industry Guide Disclosures for Bank Holding Companies, Release No.
33-6478 (Aug. 11, 1983) [48 FR 37609 (Aug. 19, 1983)]; Amendments to Industry Guide Disclosures by Bank

Securities Act Industry Guide 4 – Prospectuses Relating to Interests in Oil and Gas Programs. Industry Guide 4
was first published in 1970 as Guide 55, which was redesignated as Securities Act Industry Guide 4 in 1982.
See Definitive Guide for the Preparation of Prospectuses Relating to Interests in Oil and Gas Programs, Release
No. 33-5036 (Jan. 19, 1970) [35 FR 1233 (Jan. 30, 1970)]. While the disclosure requirements for oil and gas
producing activities were modernized in 2008 (at which time Industry Guide 2 was eliminated), the changes did
not affect Securities Act Industry Guide 4. Securities Act Industry Guide 4 is focused on disclosure relating to
the offering of interests in oil and gas programs, such as the terms of the offering, the participation in costs and
revenues, application of proceeds and risk factors.

629

Securities Act Industry Guide 5 – Preparation of Registration Statements Relating to Interests in Real Estate
Limited Partnerships. Industry Guide 5 was originally published in 1976 as Guide 60 and redesignated as
Securities Act Industry Guide 5 in 1982. See Preparation of Registration Statements Relating to Interests in
Real Estate Limited Partnerships, Release No. 33-5692 (March 17, 1976) [41 FR 17403 (Apr. 26, 1976)];

We are seeking public input on whether the Industry Guides elicit disclosure that is
important to investment and voting decisions. We are interested in commenters’ views on
whether the Industry Guides provide useful guidance for registrants that improves disclosure to

Securities Act and Exchange Act Industry Guide 7 – Description of Property by Issuers Engaged or To Be
Engaged in Significant Mining Operations (“Industry Guide 7”). Industry-specific disclosure requirements for
mining companies were previously included in various Securities Act Forms. In 1992, in connection with the
Commission’s small business initiatives that rescinded Form S-18, Item 17A of Form S-18 was redesignated as
Industry Guide 7, so that the industry specific guidance would be applicable to all issuers engaged in mining
operations, not only to small business issuers. See Small Business Initiatives, Release No. 33-6949 (July 30,
1992) [57 FR 36442 (Aug. 13, 1992)] (“Small Business Initiatives Adopting Release”). A rulemaking petition
to amend Industry Guide 7 was submitted to the Commission in October 2012. See letter from the Society for
Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Oct. 1, 2012, available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2012/petn4654.pdf.

Guidance contained in Exchange Act Industry Guides 3 and 4 applies to the description of business portion of
registration statements filed on Form 10; in proxy and information statements relating to mergers,
consolidations, acquisitions, and similar matters (Item 14 of Schedule 14A and Item 1 of Schedule 14C); and in
reports filed on Forms 10-K. See Item 802 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.802]. Exchange Act Industry
Guide 7 does not specify the Exchange Act filings to which the guidance applies.
In proposing to re-designate the Industry Guides, the Commission noted that industry guidelines “maximize”
the quality of disclosure in certain industries. Accordingly, though not specifically applicable to Exchange Act
filings, Industry Guide 5 may be useful in determining the type of information that might be important in an
Exchange Act filing for a real estate program. See Proposed Revision of Regulation S-K and Guides for the
Preparation and Filing of Registration Statements and Reports, Release No. 33-6276 (Dec. 23, 1980) [46 FR 78

We focus only on the Industry Guides in this section of the release. We do not address items of Regulation S-K
that contain industry-specific disclosure requirements, such as Item 104, which requires disclosure about mine
safety that is applicable only to registrants that operate coal or other mines. Additionally, this section focuses
on the Industry Guides generally and does not pose questions specific to any of the Industry Guides, although
we welcome comments on specific revisions to any of the Industry Guides. As part of the Disclosure
Effectiveness Initiative, the staff is currently considering recommendations for Industry Guides 3 and 7.
Comment letters received specific to Industry Guides 3 and 7 are being considered as part of these staff
recommendations.

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. A few commenters recommended general updates to
all Industry Guides. 634 One commenter recommended that we consider additional industryspecific disclosure requirements and consider whether changes in the economy require additional
industry-specific disclosure in either or both Regulations S-X and S-K. 635 This commenter also
stated that the Industry Guides should be updated to reflect changes in disclosure requirements
within Regulations S-X and S-K and stated that the Industry Guides, relative to U.S. GAAP and
Regulation S-X, could use improvement. One commenter suggested that improved Industry
Guides could be helpful in highly-regulated or specialized industries, such as financial
institutions and banks, mining, oil and gas exploration, and the pharmaceutical industry. 636 This
commenter also suggested moving industry-specific disclosure requirements currently in
Regulation S-K to the relevant Industry Guide. 637 One commenter recommended requiring
additional disclosure from oil and gas companies about the carbon asset risk to such
companies. 638

shorten the comment process. 639 The Guides represented policies and practices followed by the
Division and were published in response to an increase in the number of filings reviewed by the
Division and an associated increase in the amount of time between the filing and effective dates
of a registration statement. 640 The Guides were intended to provide uniformity and enhance
comparability of disclosure while reducing the necessity for staff comment on matters addressed
in the Guides. 641 The Guides were modified and expanded over time, in part, to address
anticipated disclosure issues. 642
In connection with the adoption of the integrated disclosure system in 1982, the Guides
relating to specific industries were re-designated as Industry Guides and the titles of the
Securities Act Industry Guides and Exchange Act Industry Guides were listed in Items 801 and
802 of Regulation S-K, respectively. 643 Although the Industry Guide titles are listed in Items

639

The first Guides were published in 1962. By 1979, there were 63 Guides for the preparation and filing of
registration statements and five Guides for the preparation and filing of periodic reports. See 1980 Proposed
Revision of Regulation S-K (discussing the history of the guides) 1964 Guides; S-K Study at 7, footnote 16, and

See 1964 Guides (“It is expected that the publication of these policies and practices will not only be of

801 and 802 of Regulation S-K, these guides are not part of Regulation S-K and are not rules,
regulations or statements of the Commission.644
In 1996, the Task Force on Disclosure Simplification recommended incorporating the
Industry Guides into Regulation S-K, based on the Task Force’s understanding that registrants
find the role of the Industry Guides within our disclosure regime confusing. 645 The Task Force
also recommended eliminating Industry Guide 1 (Disclosure of Principal Sources of Electric and
Gas Revenues) because the Task Force believed that the information required by the Industry
Guide was provided in response to other disclosure requirements. 646
Although it did not incorporate the Industry Guides into Regulation S-K, 647 the
Commission did follow the Task Force’s recommendation 648 to eliminate Industry Guide 1
(Disclosure of Principal Sources of Electric and Gas Revenues) because the information
requested by the Industry Guide is covered by other Commission rules, including Items 101 and
303 of Regulation S-K. 649 In 2008, the Commission modernized the reporting requirements
applicable to oil and gas reserves and codified the disclosure items formerly in Industry Guide 2
by relocating them into Regulation S-K. 650

644

See Industry Guide Release.

645

See Task Force Report (recommending that the Industry Guides be placed intact at the end of Regulation S-K,
in the manner that industry-specific disclosure requirements are currently placed in Regulation S-X). The Task
Force also recommended that the Commission consider adopting rules applicable to additional industries and
recommended general modernization of the Industry Guides. Id.

See Task Force Report. The Task Force stated that the disclosure provided by Guide 1 appears to be adequately
covered by the requirements of Regulation S-K, primarily Items 101 and 303 of Regulation S-K.

recommendations was not intended to indicate either approval or disapproval of any of the remaining
recommendations or suggestions in the Task Force Report. See Phase One Recommendations of Task Force on

The S-K Study recommended reviewing the Industry Guides to evaluate whether they
continue to elicit useful information that would not otherwise be disclosed. The S-K Study also
recommended considering whether any Industry Guide provisions should be codified in
Regulation S-K, whether any information is duplicative of U.S. GAAP requirements and whether
industry-specific disclosure requirements should be scaled or transition periods be provided for
certain classes of registrants. 651
In proposing the re-designation of the Industry Guides, the Commission cited industry
guidelines as an example of the limited instances where the use of guidelines is appropriate,
stating that guidelines should pertain only to areas such as industry-specific information, where
more specific guidance is appropriate yet flexibility is necessary to tailor disclosures to particular
facts and circumstances. 652 The Commission cited findings of the Sommer Report in concluding
that the use of industry guidelines minimizes the extent to which registrants must comply with
inapplicable disclosure requirements, maximizes the quality of the disclosure made for particular
industries, and provides Commission staff with a reference for examining filings by particular
industries. 653
We are seeking input on whether the Industry Guides continue to achieve the benefits
cited by the Commission when it re-designated the guides in 1980. Today, the Division publicly
releases its comment letters. 654 These letters are often analyzed by third parties that publish

651

reports about comment trends in an industry. 655 We believe that registrants look to filings in
their industry and recently-issued staff comment letters to anticipate and proactively address
industry-specific issues.
We also are seeking public input on the advantages and disadvantages of codifying
industry-specific disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Codifying the Industry Guides in
Regulation S-K would be consistent with the approach taken by the Commission in 2008 when
former Industry Guide 2 was codified as Subpart 1200 of Regulation S-K. 656 This approach
could help provide consistency in the disclosure provided by registrants in certain industries by
making such disclosure a regulatory requirement. A potential disadvantage of this approach,
however, is that over time registrants may be required to provide industry-specific disclosure that
has become obsolete due to changes in industry practices or technology. Codifying the Industry
Guides may afford registrants less flexibility in determining the industry-specific disclosures that
are most applicable to them.
Another possible approach is to update but not codify the Industry Guides in Regulation
S-K. While this approach may allow registrants the flexibility to omit obsolete disclosures, the
fact that the guidance is not a regulatory requirement may result in less uniformity in compliance
and therefore less comparability across an industry.

registrants might not otherwise disclose under Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X?
If so, what are examples of this type of disclosure?

this disclosure?
208. Should we include additional industry-specific disclosure requirements in
Regulation S-K by codifying all or portions of the Industry Guides? What are the
advantages and disadvantages of including industry-specific disclosure
requirements in Regulation S-K versus retaining the Industry Guides?
209. Should some or all of the Industry Guides be updated? If so, which ones? Should
additional Industry Guides or industry-specific rules for other industries be
developed? If so, which industries would benefit from such guidance? Should
industry-specific disclosure in Regulation S-K or staff guidance be limited to
certain industries? If so, what criteria should be used to identify those industries?
210. What additional costs or costs savings, including the administrative and compliance
costs of preparing and disseminating disclosure, do registrants experience because
of the Industry Guides? Would registrants’ disclosure costs be higher, lower or the
same if the disclosures currently detailed in Industry Guides were incorporated into
Regulation S-K or Regulation S-X? Please provide quantitative estimates if
possible.
211. The Industry Guides originally were intended to assist registrants, their counsel and
accountants in the preparation of disclosure by publishing staff policies and

202

practices related to staff review of registrant filings. 657 Does the public release of
the staff’s comment letters and increased availability of tools that aggregate
information about disclosure included in Commission filings and comment letters
reduce the need for the Industry Guides as guidance for registrants?
212. Does the status of the Industry Guides as staff policy rather than Commission rules
have any impact on the extent to which registrants provide disclosure consistent
with the Industry Guides?
213. Regulations S-K and S-X include some industry specific disclosures. For example,
Form S-11 658 and Schedules III and IV prescribed by Articles 12-28 and 12-29 of
Regulation S-X, respectively, include industry specific disclosure requirements for
certain real estate companies. If we update and codify the Industry Guides in
Regulation S-K, should we also move and consolidate other industry-specific
disclosure requirements currently located elsewhere to Regulation S-K at the same
time? If so, how should we identify those disclosure requirements? Are any of
these other industry-specific disclosure requirements already substantially
addressed by non-industry-specific required disclosures either in Regulation S-K or
by U.S. GAAP?
214. Should industry-specific disclosure requirements apply to every registrant in a
particular industry or should they be limited to certain categories of registrants? If
they should be limited, to which registrants should they apply?

Disclosure of Information Relating to Public Policy and Sustainability Matters

In recent years, Congress has mandated new disclosure requirements that address specific
public policy concerns. For example, Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the
Commission adopt rules regarding registrants’ use of “conflict minerals” originating in specified
countries, and Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act directed the Commission to adopt rules
regarding the disclosure of payments made by resource extraction issuers to foreign governments
or the federal government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or
minerals. 659 In addition, Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires certain registrants to
disclose information about health and safety violations at mining-related facilities. 660
Some investors and interest groups also have expressed a desire for greater disclosure of
a variety of public policy and sustainability matters, stating that these matters are of increasing
significance to voting and investment decisions. 661 For example, some have urged the

659

15 U.S.C. 78m(p) and 15 U.S.C. 78m(q)(2)(A). The Commission adopted Exchange Act Rule 13p-1 and Form
SD to implement Section 1502 and proposed Rule 13q-1 and an amendment to Form SD to implement Section
1504. Rule 13q-1 was initially adopted by the Commission on August 22, 2012, but it was subsequently
vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. See Conflict Minerals, Release No. 34-67716
(Aug. 22, 2012) [77 FR 56274 (Sept. 12, 2012)] and Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers,
Release No. 34-76620 (Dec. 11, 2015) [80 FR 80057 (Dec. 23, 2015)]. See Section III.A.1 for a discussion of
the Commission’s statutory mandates.

660

15 U.S.C. 78m-2. Pursuant to authority granted in Section 1503(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission
adopted Item 104 of Regulation S-K to implement the statute. See Item 104 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR
229.104]. See also Mine Safety Disclosure Release.

Disclosure Effectiveness. We received a number of comment letters on a variety of
sustainability and public policy matters, including climate change. 664 Sustainability disclosure
encompasses a range of topics, including climate change, resource scarcity, corporate social
responsibility, and good corporate citizenship. 665 These topics often are characterized broadly as
environmental, social, or governance (“ESG”) concerns. 666 Many commenters noted a growing
interest in ESG disclosure among investors 667 and many recommended increased sustainability
disclosure requirements. 668 Some commenters criticized the primarily voluntary nature of
current corporate sustainability reporting and stated their belief that information made available
to investors is inconsistent and incomplete. 669 Many commenters also sought disclosure of

disclosure. 670
One commenter opposed mandatory disclosure of sustainability risks, 671 while another
opposed disclosure requirements that it described as addressing “societal issues unrelated to
investor protection” in periodic filings. 672 One of these commenters acknowledged the
importance of sustainability information to a variety of stakeholders but opined that these issues
“are not typically material to an understanding of the company’s financial performance” and
therefore are not appropriate for inclusion in Exchange Act reports. 673 The other commenter
raised similar materiality concerns, stating that “some groups are seeking to use the federal
securities laws to address various societal concerns, without giving effect to the bedrock
materiality principle.” 674
We received several comment letters that specifically mentioned climate change
disclosure. 675 Many of these commenters expressed concern that disclosures made in response to

guidance. 678
A few commenters suggested that we adopt new line-item disclosure requirements for
climate change matters. 679 One suggested that we adopt a requirement to disclose anticipated
full-cycle costs of future capital expenditures and a requirement to disclose the carbon content of
a registrant’s reserves and resources. 680 Another suggested that we require oil and gas
companies to disclose carbon costs alongside the company’s disclosure of proved reserves. 681 A
third commenter suggested a rule that requires an annual reporting of the risks to the registrant of
the effects of climate change, if any. 682 We also received many letters recommending the
Commission adopt a rule requiring disclosure of political spending. 683

Discussion

In 1975, the Commission considered a variety of “environmental and social” disclosure
matters, as well as its own authority and responsibilities to require disclosure under the federal
securities laws. 684 Following extensive proceedings on these topics, the Commission concluded
that it generally is not authorized to consider the promotion of goals unrelated to the objectives
of the federal securities laws when promulgating disclosure requirements, although such
considerations would be appropriate to further a specific congressional mandate. 685 The
Commission also noted that disclosure to serve the needs of limited segments of the investing
public, even if otherwise desirable, may be inappropriate, because the cost to registrants, which
must ultimately be borne by their shareholders, would likely outweigh the resulting benefits to
most investors. 686
In 1975, the Commission also concluded that it would require disclosure relating to social
and environmental performance “only if such information…is important to the reasonable

684

See 1975 Environmental Disclosure Release, supra, note 663. The Commission instituted public proceedings in
response to a court order that required the Commission to “undertake further rulemaking action to bring the
Commission’s corporate disclosure regulations into full compliance with the letter and spirit of NEPA” and to
“provide a statement of reasons for the denial of the equal employment portion of Plaintiff’s Rulemaking
Petition.” Id. at 51657. The order relates to plaintiffs’ 1971 rulemaking petition in which the plaintiffs made
specific proposals for new disclosure requirements pertaining to the environment and disclosure about the
employment of minorities and women. Regarding the equal employment portion of the petition, the plaintiffs
sought to require that the Commission require registrants to provide disclosure of statistics on equal
employment practices. The court found that the Commission’s denial of this portion of the plaintiffs’
rulemaking petition failed to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act. See Natural Resources Defense
Council.

685

See id. See also, supra, note 61. The Commission was ordered to resolve two overriding factual issues as part
of the proceeding, “the extent of ‘ethical investor’ interest in the type of information which Plaintiffs have
requested” and “what avenues of action are available which ethical investors may pursue and which will tend to
eliminate corporate practices that are inimical to the environment and equal employment opportunity.” See
Natural Resources Defense Council at 701.

686

See 1975 Environmental Disclosure Release at 51666. See also id. at note 26 (“If the Commission were
required to promulgate rules by plebiscite at the behest of any member of the public, its functions would be
purely ministerial, a result clearly not intended by Congress…”).

investor – material information.” 687 While the Commission concluded that its proceedings did
not support a specific requirement for all registrants to disclose information describing
“corporate social practices,” the Commission noted that in specific cases, some information of
this type might be necessary in order to make the statements in a filing not misleading or
otherwise complete. 688
The current statutory framework for adopting disclosure requirements remains generally
consistent with the framework that the Commission considered in 1975. 689 However, the
Commission has recognized that the task of identifying what information is material to an
investment and voting decision is a continuing one in the field of securities regulation. 690 The
role of sustainability and public policy information in investors’ voting and investment decisions
may be evolving as some investors are increasingly engaging on certain ESG matters. 691

687

See id. at 51660. The Commission’s conclusions in the 1975 proceedings were endorsed by the Sommer
Report. The Sommer Report recommended that the Commission “should require disclosure of matters of social
and environmental significance only when the information in question is material to informed investment or
corporate suffrage decision-making or required by laws other than the securities laws.” Id. at 395. The
Sommer Report further expressed the view that the Commission should classify social and environmental
information as material “only when it reflects significantly on the economic and financial performance of the
Company.” Id. at 326-327. However, the Sommer Report noted that a minority of the Advisory Committee on
Corporate Disclosure believed that disclosure of social and environmental information is material to an
investment decision regardless of its economic impact on the financial performance of the company. The
minority argued that this kind of information reflects on the quality and character of management, which
“clearly plays an important role in both investment and corporate suffrage decision-making,” and urged the
Commission to require increased disclosure in the social and environmental area. Id. at 397.

688

See id. at 51656; Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 [17 CFR 240.12b-20].

689

Since 1996, the Commission also has been statutorily required to consider, in addition to the protection of
investors, whether an action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See Section 2(b) of
the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)]; Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(f)]. See also Section
23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C 78w(a)(2)].

aggregate assets under management of approximately $59 trillion had signed on to the U.N.’s six Principles for
Responsible Investment (PRI) as of 2015. Among other things, the signatories to the PRI committed to
incorporate ESG issues into their investment analyses and decision making processes, be active owners around
these issues, seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by companies in which they invest, and collaborate to
promulgate the PRI broadly and enhance implementation, while reporting on their own activities).

211

In seeking public input on sustainability and public policy disclosures, we recognize that
some registrants historically have not considered this information material. Some observers
continue to share this view and have expressed concern that sustainability or policy-driven
disclosure requirements do not always result in disclosure that a reasonable investor would
consider material. 696 Some have expressed concerns that policy-driven disclosure requirements
represent a shift away from the Commission’s mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly,
and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation, and that such requirements could risk
burdening both registrants and investors with costly disclosure that is not material to any
investment or voting decision. 697 Similarly, concerns have been expressed that adopting
sustainability or policy-driven disclosure requirements may have the goal of altering corporate
behavior, rather than producing information that is important to voting and investment
decisions. 698 Additionally, one observer has noted numerous attempts to use the Commission’s
regulatory apparatus to address societal issues. 699 As the costs of compiling and disclosing
information about sustainability and public policy issues are borne by the registrant, and
ultimately its shareholders, as is all disclosure, we are seeking input on whether these disclosures
are important to investors’ voting and investment decisions.

Request for Comment

216. Are there specific sustainability or public policy issues are important to informed
voting and investment decisions? If so, what are they? If we were to adopt specific
disclosure requirements involving sustainability or public policy issues, how could
our rules elicit meaningful disclosure on such issues? How could we create a
disclosure framework that would be flexible enough to address such issues as they
evolve over time? Alternatively, what additional Commission or staff guidance, if
any, would be necessary to elicit meaningful disclosure on such issues?
217. Would line-item requirements for disclosure about sustainability or public policy
issues cause registrants to disclose information that is not material to investors?
Would these disclosures obscure information that is important to an understanding
of a registrant’s business and financial condition? Why or why not?
218. Some registrants already provide information about ESG matters in sustainability or
corporate social responsibility reports or on their websites. 700 Corporate
sustainability reports may also be available in databases aggregating such reports. 701
Why do some registrants choose to provide sustainability information outside of
their Commission filings? Is the information provided on company websites

sufficient to address investor needs? What are the advantages and disadvantages of
registrants providing such disclosure on their websites? How important to investors
is integrated reporting, 702 as opposed to separate financial and sustainability
reporting? If we permitted registrants to use information on their websites to satisfy
any ESG disclosure requirement, how would this affect the comparability and
consistency of the disclosure?
219. In an effort to coordinate ESG disclosures, several organizations have published or
are working on sustainability reporting frameworks. 703 Currently, some registrants
use these frameworks and provide voluntary ESG disclosures. 704 If we propose
line-item disclosure requirements on sustainability or public policy issues, which, if
any, of these frameworks should we consider in developing any additional
disclosure requirements?
220. Are there sustainability or public policy issues for which line-item disclosure
requirements would be consistent with the Commission’s rulemaking authority and
our mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets and
facilitate capital formation, as described in Section III.A.1 of this release? If so,
how could we address the evolving nature of such issues and keep our disclosure
requirements current?

221. What, if any, challenges would registrants face in preparing and providing this
information? What would be the additional costs of complying with sustainability
or public policy line-item disclosure requirements, including the administrative and
compliance costs of preparing and disseminating disclosures, beyond the costs
associated with current levels of disclosure? Please quantify costs and expected
changes in costs where possible.
222. If we propose line-item disclosure requirements that require disclosure about
sustainability or public policy issues, should we scale the disclosure requirements
for SRCs or some other category of registrant? Similarly, should we exempt SRCs
or some other category of issuer from any such requirements?
223. In 2010, the Commission published an interpretive release to assist registrants in
applying existing disclosure requirements to climate change matters. As part of the
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative, we received a number of comment letters
suggesting that current climate change-related disclosures are insufficient. Are
existing disclosure requirements adequate to elicit the information that would
permit investors to evaluate material climate change risk? Why or why not? If not,
what additional disclosure requirements or guidance would be appropriate to elicit
that information?

Exhibits

Exhibits to Commission filings provide detailed information about the registrant that
generally is not available in the form itself. Item 601 of Regulation S-K specifies, by form type,
the exhibits that registrants must file with Securities Act and Exchange Act forms. The exhibit
requirements for Exchange Act forms overlap with many – but not all – of the exhibit

215

requirements for Securities Act forms. Similarly, although there are some differences between
the exhibit requirements for Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, many of the required exhibits are the
same. Exhibits required in Exchange Act reports cover such categories as certain transactions, 705
corporate organization and governance, 706 rights of securities holders, 707 matters relating to the
financial statements (including certifications), 708 and material contracts. 709
The requirement to file exhibits originated in Schedule A of the Securities Act, which
requires registrants to file copies of certain agreements, opinions and governing instruments. 710
Over time, the Commission has adopted additional requirements for exhibits as part of different
forms under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. 711 In 1980, the Commission standardized
and centralized the exhibit requirements by moving them from individual forms to Item 601 in

705

E.g., Item 601(b)(2) of Regulation S-K (plan of acquisition, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation or
succession) [17 CFR 229.601(b)(2)].

706

E.g., Items 601(b)(3)(i)-(ii) (articles of incorporation, bylaws); (b)(14) (code of ethics); (b)(20) (documents or
statements to security holders); (b)(21) (subsidiaries of the registrant); (b)(22) (published report regarding
matters submitted to vote of security holders); (b)(24) (power of attorney); (b)(31) (Exchange Act Rule 13a14(a)/15d-14(a) certifications) and (b)(32) (Exchange Act Section 1350 certifications) of Regulation S-K [17
CFR 229.601(b)(3)(i)-(ii), (b)(14), (b)(20), (b)(21), (b)(22), (b)(24), (b)(31) and (b)(32)].

707

E.g., Items 601(b)(4) (instruments defining the rights of security holders) and (b)(9) (voting trust agreement) of
Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(4) and (9)].

708

E.g., Items 601(b)(15) (letter re unaudited interim financial information); (b)(16) (change in certifying
accountant); (b)(18) (change in accounting principles); (b)(31) (Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a)
certifications) and (b)(32) (Exchange Act Section 1350 certifications) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601
(b)(15), (b)(16), (b)(18), (b)(31) and (b)(32)].

709

Item 601(b)(10) (material contracts) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(10)].

710

See Securities Act of 1933 Schedule A Paragraphs (28) through (32) [15 U.S.C. 77aa(28)-(32)], which require
registrants to file underwriting agreements, opinions of counsel regarding the legality of the offering, material
contracts, governing instruments (such as articles of incorporation, bylaws and partnership agreements) and
agreements or indentures affecting the offered securities.

711

For instance, in 1971, the Commission adopted a new exhibit requirement for a report on a material change in
accounting principles or practices accompanied by a letter from the independent accountant approving or
otherwise commenting on such changes. See Section IV.G.6. Similarly, in 1977, the Commission began
requiring companies to file as exhibits copies of every contract specifically referred to in the company’s
discussion of its reportable industry segments. See infra note 754 and accompanying text.

216

Regulation S-K. 712 The exhibit requirements adopted in 1980 remain substantially the same
today. 713 In 2003, however, the Commission adopted additional exhibit requirements mandated
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 714 In 2009, the Commission adopted rules to require filing of
interactive data-tagged financial statements as part of its 21st Century Disclosure Initiative. 715
More recently, the Commission adopted additional exhibit requirements mandated by the DoddFrank Act. 716
To the extent that exhibits contain confidential and proprietary information, Commission
rules permit registrants to omit this information from their public filings. For Exchange Act
filings, registrants may obtain confidential treatment of information under Rule 24b-2. This rule
requires registrants seeking confidential treatment to submit an application to the Commission
objecting to disclosure of such information along with an analysis of the applicable exemption
under FOIA. 717 Most applicants rely on the exemption that covers trade secrets and commercial

See Amendments Regarding Exhibit Requirements, Release No. 33-6230 (Aug. 27, 1980) [45 FR 58822 (Sept.
5, 1980)] (“1980 Exhibits Adopting Release”). Prior to 1980, exhibit requirements were included in each
registration statement form or periodic report form and many requirements were inconsistent from form to form.
The changes were intended to simplify and codify the exhibit requirements.

713

With the adoption of the integrated disclosure system in 1982, the Commission made technical changes to the
exhibit requirements and re-designated the requirements from Item 7 to Item 601. See 1982 Integrated
Disclosure Adopting Release.

Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 [17 CFR 240.24b-2]. The rule requires an application containing: an identification of
the confidential portion; a statement of the grounds of objection referring to, and containing an analysis of, the
applicable exemption(s) from disclosure under the Commission’s rules and regulations adopted under FOIA,

217

or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential. 718 If the
Commission grants the application, the registrant may omit the information from its public
filings for a limited period of time identified in the application. 719
We are seeking input on Item 601 of Regulation S-K to determine whether its
requirements continue to provide investors with information important to making informed
investment and voting decisions. Consistent with the scope of this release, we are considering
only those exhibits required in quarterly and annual reports filed under the Exchange Act, which
are identified in the following table. 720 While we do not specifically address each exhibit in our
discussion, we welcome comments on any of the items listed below. 721

Request for Comment

224. Should we modify or eliminate any of the exhibit requirements in Item 601? If so,
which ones and why? Should we add any new exhibit requirements to Item 601? If
so, what requirements should we add and why?
225. Should we revise any of our exhibit requirements to change the presentation or
format of the exhibits?
226. Should the Commission consider changes to improve the usefulness of the exhibits?
For example, should the exhibits be provided in a tagged or searchable manner?
227. What types of investors or audiences are most likely to value the information that
registrants disclose in the exhibits?
228. What is the cost of providing the disclosure required under Item 601, including
administrative and compliance costs of preparing and disseminating this disclosure?
How would these costs change if we made any of the changes contemplated here?
Please provide quantified estimates if possible and include only those costs
associated with Item 601.
2.

Schedules and Attachments to Exhibits

In response to Item 601, registrants generally must file exhibits as complete documents,
including any schedules or attachments. These schedules and attachments can be lengthy and
sometimes contain proprietary information. The only exception to the requirement to file
schedules and attachments applies to a plan of acquisition, reorganization, arrangement,
220

liquidation or succession filed under Item 601(b)(2). 723 The rule provides that schedules or
similar attachments to these exhibits shall not be filed unless they contain information which is
material to an investment decision and has not been disclosed otherwise. 724

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter suggested adding a new instruction
to Item 601 permitting the omission of schedules to all exhibits required to be filed, unless such
schedules contain material information that is not otherwise disclosed in the exhibit or in the
filing, as is the case with current Item 601(b)(2). 725 Alternatively, this commenter suggested that
we revise Item 601 to permit companies to omit personally identifiable and similar information,
such as bank account numbers and home addresses, without having to apply for confidential
treatment to protect the information. 726
b.

Discussion

The Commission first permitted registrants to omit schedules and attachments for Item
601(b)(2) exhibits in 1980. 727 In revising the exhibit requirement, the Commission stated that
many of the schedules received by the staff pursuant to the exhibit requirement were not material
for investor information or protection and were unnecessary for Commission review purposes. 728

723

See Item 601(b)(2) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(2)].

724

Id. The exhibit filed must include a list briefly identifying the contents of all omitted schedules along with an
agreement to provide a supplemental copy of any omitted schedules to the Commission upon request. Id.

221

Material contracts filed under Item 601(b)(10) often include schedules that contain
information that is not material to investors or that has been disclosed or sufficiently described
elsewhere in the exhibit or in the disclosure. Examples of schedules and attachments providing
information that may be immaterial include detailed product specifications attached to royalty
agreements; implementation plans attached to service agreements; premises descriptions and
plots as schedules to real estate leases; and licensing agreements with schedules listing
immaterial patents. To the extent these schedules contain confidential and proprietary
information, registrants may be permitted to omit such information from the public filing. 729
c.

Request for Comment

229. Should we continue to allow registrants to omit schedules and attachments for
exhibits filed under Item 601(b)(2)? Why? If so, what qualitative or quantitative
factors should be considered when determining if omission is appropriate?
230. Should we allow registrants to omit immaterial schedules and attachments from
their filed exhibits? If so, should we expand this approach to all exhibits, or should
we limit it to material contracts filed under Item 601(b)(10)? Should we provide
examples or other guidance on how registrants could evaluate materiality for
purposes of including schedules and attachments? If so, what type of guidance
would be most useful for assessing the importance of the information (e.g.,
quantitative thresholds, qualitative factors)? What would be the potential benefits
and challenges associated with such an approach? If registrants omit schedules and
attachments based on immateriality, should we require registrants to disclose how
they assessed materiality for these purposes?
729

See supra notes 717, 718 and 719 and accompanying text.

222

231. If we allow the omission of immaterial schedules and attachments from all or
certain filed exhibits, should we require registrants to include with such exhibits a
list briefly identifying the contents of all omitted schedules, together with an
agreement to provide a supplemental copy of any omitted schedule to the
Commission upon request, similar to the requirement in Item 601(b)(2)?
232. Schedules and attachments to exhibits sometimes contain personally identifiable
information (“PII”), and registrants may request confidential treatment of that
information. Division staff generally does not object to the omission of PII from
exhibits without a formal confidential treatment request, provided the registrant
does not omit any other information from its exhibits. If we retain the requirement
for registrants to file schedules and attachments to exhibits, should we codify
current staff practice and permit registrants to omit PII without making a formal
request under Rule 24b-2 of the Exchange Act? Should we limit such an
accommodation to information contained in schedules and attachments to exhibits,
or should we expand it to all exhibit filings?
3.

Amendments to Exhibits

Any amendment or modification to a previously filed exhibit to a Form 10-K or Form
10-Q must be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K or Form 10-Q. 730 Registrants generally must
file such amendments or modifications regardless of the significance of the change. 731 As a
result, registrants may be required to file a significant number of amendments that are not

730

Item 601(a)(4) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(a)(4)].

731

For a discussion of changes to exhibits and Instruction 1 to Item 601, see Section IV.G.4.

223

necessarily material to investors. However, registrants are not required to file amendments or
modifications when the previously filed exhibit would not currently be required. 732
For amendments to articles of incorporation or bylaws, Item 601 requires registrants to
file a complete copy of the document as amended. 733 Item 601 does not include a similar
requirement for other exhibits, and registrants typically file amendments to these exhibits
without filing a complete, amended and restated version of the agreement.

Comments Received

S-K Study. None.
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter suggested revising Item 601(a)(4) to
exclude amendments to material contracts that do not affect the economics of such contracts
(e.g., technical amendments) from the requirement to file any amendment or modification to a
previously filed exhibit.734
b.

Discussion

With adoption of the integrated disclosure system, the Commission consolidated several
requirements in Forms 10-Q and 10-K for amendments and modifications to previously filed
exhibits.735 The new item required registrants to file as exhibits all amendments or modifications

732

For example, a previously filed exhibit may no longer be material to a registrant as a result of the registrant’s
growth or change in business focus. The Commission revised Item 601 in 1982 to clarify that amendments and
modifications must be filed only for currently required exhibits as opposed to previously filed exhibits that are
no longer material and required to be filed. See 1982 Integrated Disclosure Adopting Release.

733

Item 601(b)(3) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(3)]. If such amendment is being reported on Form 8-K,
however, the registrant is required to file only the text of the amendment as a Form 8-K exhibit. In such case, a
complete copy of the articles of incorporation or bylaws as amended must be filed as an exhibit to the next
Securities Act registration statement or periodic report filed by the registrant to which this exhibit requirement
applies. Id.

734

See ABA 2.

735

See 1980 Exhibits Adopting Release. For example, prior to 1980, Form 10-K required registrants to file copies
of all amendments or modifications, not previously filed, to all exhibits previously filed, or copies of such
exhibits as amended or modified. See, e.g., 1965 Amendments to Form 10-K Adopting Release.

224

to exhibits that were previously filed with those forms. 736 The requirement was moved to
paragraph (a)(4) of Item 601 in 1993 and has remained unchanged since. 737
Registrants frequently amend agreements, such as credit facilities, licensing agreements,
manufacturing agreements and supply agreements, to extend their duration. Registrants also
amend credit facilities to increase the amount available for borrowing. Other than amended
articles of incorporation or bylaws, multiple amendments to the same agreement may be
dispersed among different periodic reports.
c.

Request for Comment

233. Should we continue to require registrants to file all amendments or modifications to
previously filed exhibits as required under Item 601(a)(4)? Should we instead
amend Item 601(a)(4) to exclude immaterial amendments? If so, should we provide
guidance to registrants about how to determine whether an amendment is
immaterial? Instead of materiality, should we permit registrants to exclude
amendments based on a different standard? If so, what standard would be
appropriate?
234. Does an amendment-only exhibit provide investors with the information they need
to evaluate the impact of the amendment on the registrant? Should we instead
require registrants to file a complete, amended and restated agreement each time an
exhibit is modified, consistent with the requirement for amendments to articles of
incorporation and bylaws? If so, should we require registrants to identify changes
in the amended and restated contracts such as by underlining or highlighting the

changes? Would complying with such a requirement be more burdensome for
agreements than for articles of incorporation or bylaws? If so, why?

Changes to Exhibits (Instruction 1 to Item 601)

If an exhibit to a registration statement is filed in preliminary form, Instruction 1 to Item
601 provides that registrants are not required to file an amendment to the exhibit if it has been
changed only (1) to insert certain information that appears elsewhere in an amendment to the
registration statement or a prospectus filed pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424(b), or (2) to
correct typographical errors, insert signatures or make other similar immaterial changes. 738 No
similar provision exists for exhibits to Exchange Act reports. Instruction 1 also provides that any
such incomplete exhibit may not be incorporated by reference in any subsequent filing under any
Act administered by the Commission.

do not reflect the modifications described in the instruction may not be incorporated by reference
in any subsequent filing. 739

738

Instruction 1 to Item 601 of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601]. The instruction states that if an exhibit to a
registration statement (other than an opinion or consent), filed in preliminary form, has been changed only (A)
to insert information as to interest, dividend or conversion rates, redemption or conversion prices, purchase or
offering prices, underwriters’ or dealers’ commissions, names, addresses or participation of underwriters or
similar matters, which information appears elsewhere in an amendment to the registration statement or a
prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (230.424(b) of this chapter), or (B) to correct
typographical errors, insert signatures or make other similar immaterial changes, then, notwithstanding any
contrary requirement of any rule or form, the registrant need not refile such exhibit as so amended. Any such
incomplete exhibit may not, however, be incorporated by reference in any subsequent filing under any Act
administered by the Commission. Id.

Discussion

The Commission adopted the predecessor to Instruction 1 of Item 601 in 1954 in
connection with new rules designed to simplify the registration procedure for offers involving
competitive bidding. 740 Those rules provided that, if certain conditions were met, post-effective
amendments reflecting the results of the bidding would become effective without the need for a
Commission order. 741 This provision was intended to avoid the delay and attendant uncertainty
that occurred between the filing and effectiveness of post-effective amendments. 742 Consistent
with this goal, the Commission eliminated a requirement for registrants to refile exhibits solely
to insert interest rate, redemption prices and certain other offering-related information. 743 The
Commission retained this provision as Instruction 1 to Item 601. 744
While Instruction 1 is intended to address timing concerns in certain registered offerings,
it also affects registrants’ ability to incorporate exhibits by reference to other filings. To the
extent a registrant modifies an incomplete exhibit that was filed in preliminary form, as
permitted under Instruction 1, the incomplete exhibit already on file may not be incorporated by

Federal Register] (“1954 Adopting Release”).

741

See id. At the time, registrants engaged in offerings involving competitive bidding were required to file posteffective amendments to registration statements at the time the bids were opened to reflect the results of the
bidding. These post-effective amendments were only effective pursuant to an order from the Commission.

Request for Comment

235. Should we eliminate Instruction 1?
236. Should we expand the applicability of Instruction 1 to all filings? Should we
expand the type of information in clauses (A) and (B) of Instruction 1 to cover
additional types of information that, if changed, do not need to be refiled as an
amendment to the exhibit?
237. Instruction 1 states that any incomplete exhibit may not be incorporated by
reference in any subsequent filing. 745 Should we eliminate this limitation?

Material Contracts (Item 601(b)(10))

Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K requires registrants to file material contracts that fall
into one of three broad categories:
•

All contracts not made in the ordinary course of business that are material to the

Contracts not made in the ordinary course – Item 601(b)(10)(i)

Item 601(b)(10)(i) requires registrants to file every contract not made in the ordinary
course of business that is material to the registrant and is to be performed in whole or in part at or
after the filing of the report, or was entered into not more than two years before such filing. 748
Registrants are required to file only those contracts to which the registrant or subsidiary of the
registrant is a party or has succeeded to a party by assumption or assignment or in which the
registrant or such subsidiary has a beneficial interest.

Comments Received

S-K Study. Two commenters stated that the agreements required to be filed pursuant to
Item 601(b)(10)(i) often contain confidential information. 749 These commenters also stated that
the process of filing the agreements and obtaining confidential treatment is burdensome on
registrants and provides information of limited value to investors. 750

Discussion

In 1964, Congress expanded the information requirements for registration statements
filed under Section 12 of the Exchange Act by adding a requirement to include material contracts

747

Item 601(a)(4) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(a)(4) and Instruction 2 to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation SK [17 CFR 229.601(b)(10)].

748

Item 601(b)(10)(i) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(10)(i)]. This requirement is virtually identical to
paragraph 24 of Schedule A of the Securities Act. [15 U.S.C. 77aa(24)].

not made in the ordinary course of business. 751 Following these Exchange Act amendments, the
Commission revised Form 10-K to make the form available for annual reports of all Exchange
Act registrants and expanded the form’s disclosure requirements. 752 Among other changes, these
amendments included a requirement in Form 10-K to file material contracts not made in the
ordinary course of business, not previously filed and performed or to be performed at or after the
beginning of the fiscal year covered by the report. 753 This requirement was similar to the new
requirement to file such exhibits with Exchange Act registration statements which, however,
required this information for two years prior to filing of the registration statement.
In 1977, with the adoption of Regulation S-K, the Commission expanded the exhibit
requirements for contracts not made in the ordinary course of business to include those that were
material to an understanding of the registrant’s overall business or specifically referred to in the
registrant’s discussion of its reportable industry segments. 754 In 1980, the Commission

751

See Summary and Interpretation of Amendments to Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Contained in the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964, Release No. 34-7425 (Sept. 15, 1964) [29 FR 13455
(Sept. 30, 1964)].
As amended, Section 12(b) required registrants to file material contracts, not made in the ordinary course of
business, which are to be executed in whole or in part at or after the filing of the Exchange Act registration
statement or which were made not more than two years before such filing. Schedule A includes a similar
requirement for Securities Act registration statements. [15 U.S.C. 77aa(24)]. As noted at the time, the
amendment to Section 12(b) followed the Commission’s recommendation that registration under both the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act be made as similar as possible. See Lee J. Sclar, The Securities Acts
Amendments of 1964: Selected Provisions and Legislative Deficiencies, 53 Cal. L. Rev. 1494, 1515 (1965).
The two-year requirement was intended as a “cutoff period” so registrants would not have to file all material
contracts executed as early as 1932, even though they may have been fully performed years ago. See H.R Rep.
No. 88-1418, 83rd Cong., 2nd Sess., 1964. See also Richard M. Phillips and Morgan Shipman, An Analysis of
the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964, 1964 Duke L.J. 706, 788-789 (1964).

Id. Similar to the language in amended Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, the new requirement called for
“[c]opies of every material contract not made in the ordinary course of business and not previously filed which
was performed or to be performed in whole or in part at or after the beginning of the fiscal year covered by the
report on this form.” Id. at 3433. The Commission adopted additional exhibit requirements with these
amendments, which we discuss below in Section IV.G.5.b.

eliminated the latter requirement, 755 noting that many contracts referred to in the disclosure may
not be material to the registrant. 756 With this revision, the Commission sought to reduce the
number of contracts required to be filed without impairing investor information or protection. 757
In 1982, the Commission adopted the current requirements described in Items 601(b)(10)(i) and
(ii) with the adoption of the integrated disclosure system. 758
In 2004, the Commission adopted Items 1.01 and 1.02 of Form 8-K, which require
disclosure when a registrant enters into, amends or terminates an agreement that is material to the
registrant and is not made in the ordinary course of business. 759 In the proposing release, the
Commission sought comment on whether it should use a disclosure threshold that is tied to a
financial measure, rather than materiality. 760 The Commission ultimately adopted the reporting
requirements with a materiality threshold because the standard was “already familiar to reporting
companies,” noting that the materiality threshold parallels the materiality threshold for filing this
type of agreement under Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K. 761

Request for Comment

238. Item 601(b)(10)(i) does not include any guidance for determining whether a
contract not made in the ordinary course of business is material to a registrant.
Should we consider revising the requirement to provide quantitative or other
thresholds for determining when a contract is material to the registrant? If so, how
should we define these thresholds? Would such a change facilitate registrants’
compliance with this item requirement? Would such a change result in disclosure
that is useful to investors?
239. Does “not made in the ordinary course of business” provide a clear standard for
agreements covered by the rule? Should a different standard to apply? Should we
revise Item 601(b)(10)(i) to define the types of contracts not made in the ordinary
course of business that companies are required to file as exhibits? If so, how should
we define such contracts?
240. Item 601(b)(10)(i) requires registrants to file material contracts that either (i) are to
be performed in whole or in part at or after the filing of the periodic report, or (ii)
were entered into not more than two years before such filing. This requirement was
enacted in the context of requiring material contracts for newly reporting registrants
that were entered into within the last two years but may have been fully performed
before the period covered by the report. Do such contracts continue to be important
to investors? Should we limit subparagraph (ii) to newly reporting registrants? For
registrants that are already subject to reporting requirements, should we eliminate
subparagraph (ii) and require registrants to file only material contracts that are to be
performed in whole or in part at or after the filing of the report? Should we revise

232

Item 601(b)(10)(i) to require all material agreements to be filed regardless of when
they were entered into, as long as such agreements remain material to the
registrant? Under what circumstances could a contract remain material to a
registrant if it has been fully performed in a prior period?
b.

Certain contracts made in the ordinary course – Item 601(b)(10)(ii)

Contracts made in the ordinary course of business conducted by a registrant and its
subsidiaries generally do not need to be filed. Item 601(b)(10)(ii), however, establishes specific
exceptions to the general rule and requires certain contracts to be filed even when they ordinarily
accompany the kind of business conducted by the registrant and its subsidiaries. The following
types of contracts must be filed, except where immaterial in amount or significance:
•

Any contract to which directors, officers, voting trustees, security holders named in
the registration statement or report, or underwriters are parties, other than contracts
involving only the purchase or sale of current assets that have a determinable market
price, at such market price; 762

•

Any contract upon which the registrant’s business is substantially dependent, such as
continuing contracts to sell the major part of the registrant’s products or services or to
purchase the major part of the registrant’s requirements of goods, services or raw
materials or any franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade
secret, process or trade name upon which the registrant’s business depends to a
material extent; 763

763

Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(B) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(10)(ii)(B)].

233

•

Any contract calling for the acquisition or sale of any property, plant or equipment for
a consideration exceeding fifteen percent of such fixed assets of the registrant on a
consolidated basis; 764 or

•

Any material lease under which a part of the property described in the filing is held
by the registrant. 765

Comments Received

S-K Study. We received letters from two commenters addressing the requirement in Item
601(b)(10)(ii)(B) to file any contract upon which the registrant’s business is substantially
dependent, as in the case of a continuing contract to sell the major part of a registrant’s products
or services or to purchase the major part of a registrant’s requirements for goods, services or raw
materials. Both commenters requested guidance interpreting the phrase “the major part” to mean
agreements involving a majority of the products or services sold or purchased. 766 Both
commenters also noted that the filing threshold for agreements that are “immaterial in amount or
significance” as it relates to Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(A) leads to a disproportionate burden on EGCs,
which frequently enter into agreements with parties that have a five percent or greater ownership
of the registrant. 767 These commenters suggested that other disclosure provisions require the
filing or disclosure of “relevant information” regarding these related party agreements. 768

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter noted that the reference in Item
601(b)(10)(ii)(B) to contracts to sell the major part of a registrant’s products or services is tied
neither to a specific quantitative threshold nor to materiality. 769 This commenter recommended
that the Commission undertake a study to harmonize various qualitative disclosure thresholds in
Regulation S-K, such as “major part” in Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(B) and “major significance” in Item
102, to reduce the ambiguity in their application. This commenter also suggested revising Item
601(b)(10)(ii) so that contracts with certain insiders or other parties identified in the item need
not be filed if they contain terms no less favorable to the registrant than terms that could have
been obtained from unrelated third parties. Another commenter recommended eliminating the
requirement in Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(D) to file material leases and suggested that disclosure about
physical properties usually does not provide investors with meaningful information. 770

Discussion – Background and Scope of Item 601(b)(10)(ii)

The Commission’s 1965 amendments to Form 10-K included a requirement for
registrants to file as exhibits certain specified contracts made in the ordinary course of
business. 771 The contracts specified in Form 10-K at that time were similar to those identified
today in Item 601(b)(10)(ii). 772 In addition, Form 10-K included a catch-all requirement to file

769

See ABA 2.

770

See Shearman.

771

See 1965 Amendments to Form 10-K Adopting Release.

772

See id. The 1965 amendments consisted of the following six categories: “(1) Directors, officers, promoters,
voting trustees, or security holders named in answer to Item 5 [Principal Holders of Voting Securities] are
parties thereto except where the contract merely involves purchase or sale of current assets having a
determinable market price, at such price; (2) It is of such materiality as to call for specific reference to it in
answer to Item 4 [Changes in the Business] or 9 [Interest of Management and Others in Certain
Transactions];(3) The registrant’s business is substantially dependent upon it, as in the case of continuing
contracts to sell the major part of registrant’s production in the case of a manufacturing enterprise or to purchase
the major part of registrant’s requirements of goods in the case of a distribution enterprise, or licenses to use a
patent or formula upon which registrant's business depends to a material extent; (4) It calls for the acquisition or
sale of fixed assets for a consideration exceeding 10 percent of all fixed assets of the registrant and its

235

an exhibit when the “amount of the contract, or its importance to the business of the registrant
and its subsidiaries, [is] material, and the terms and conditions are of a nature of which investors
reasonably should be informed.” 773
In 1980, the Commission codified in Regulation S-K the exhibit filing requirements,
including the filing requirements for material contracts. 774 The requirements adopted in 1980
modified the existing requirements and were substantially similar to the current requirements in
Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(A)-(D). The Commission modified the requirement to file agreements for
the acquisition or sale of “fixed assets,” adopting instead a requirement to file contracts for the
acquisition or sale of any “property, plant or equipment.”
iii.

Request for Comment

241. Should we expand Item 601(b)(10)(ii) to include other types of contracts that,
although made in the ordinary course of business, should be filed?
242. Should we revise our overall approach to Item 601(b)(10)(ii) and if so, how?
Rather than specifying categories of contracts, is there an alternative approach that
would appropriately capture those ordinary course contracts that are important to
investors? For example, should we replace the current requirements in Item
601(b)(10)(ii)(A)-(D) with a requirement for registrants to file all ordinary course
contracts entered into (i) since the beginning of the last fiscal year, (ii) that exceed a
percent of some measure, such as revenue or net income and (iii) where the
registrant has a direct or indirect material interest? If we took this approach, how
subsidiaries; (5) It is a lease under which a material amount of property is held by the registrant; or (6) The
amount of the contract, or its importance to the business of the registrant and its subsidiaries, are material, and
the terms and conditions are of a nature of which investors reasonably should be informed.” Id. at 3433.

236

should we establish the relevant time frame and percentage threshold and what
measures should we use? What would be the benefits and challenges of such an
approach?
243. Do contracts that are required to be filed pursuant to Item 601(b)(10)(ii) contain
information that is important to an understanding of the registrant or its business?
Are the types of contracts identified in Item 601(b)(10)(ii) sufficiently significant
that they should be filed, notwithstanding that they were made in the ordinary
course of business?
244. Is “immaterial in amount or significance” a helpful standard by which to determine
when a contract need not be filed? How do registrants currently apply this
standard? Should we revise the item to provide guidance on the meaning of that
phrase? Is it possible for contracts to be material in amount but not in significance?
Should we revise the item to exclude only contracts that are immaterial in amount
and significance? Would it facilitate compliance if we revised Item 601(b)(10)(ii)
to state in the affirmative that registrants must file all material contracts made in the
ordinary course of business that fall within one or more of the categories listed?
245. Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure of any related party transaction
since the beginning of the registrant’s last fiscal year if the amount involved
exceeds $120,000. 775 Unlike this bright-line disclosure threshold in Item 404(a),
Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(A) generally requires registrants to file related party contracts as
exhibits unless immaterial in amount or significance. Do the two different
775

Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.404(a)]. Registrants must describe any transaction, since the
beginning of the registrant’s last fiscal year, or any currently proposed transaction, in which the registrant was
or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or will
have a direct or indirect material interest. Id.

237

disclosure thresholds provide investors with the information they need to evaluate
related party contracts? Should we revise Item 601(b)(10)(ii) to require registrants
to file as exhibits all contracts involving related party transactions disclosed
pursuant to Item 404(a)? What would be the benefits and challenges associated
with such a revision?
246. Taken together, Items 601(b)(10)(i) and (ii) require registrants to file material
contracts not made in the ordinary course of business as well as certain contracts
made in the ordinary course of business that are material to the registrant. Should
we revise Item 601(b)(10)(ii) to require registrants simply to file all contracts that
are material to an understanding of the registrant or its business, whether or not
entered in the ordinary course of business? Are there any contracts currently
required to be filed as exhibits under Item 601(b)(10)(ii) that would not be captured
by such a principles-based approach? Conversely, would this approach require
registrants to file material ordinary course contracts that they are not currently
required to file? Would this change enhance the information available to investors?
What would be the benefits and challenges of this approach?
iv.

Discussion – Disclosure Thresholds under Item 601(b)(10)(ii)

Qualitative Thresholds. Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(B) requires registrants to file any contract
upon which the registrant’s business is substantially dependent. The item provides examples of
contracts upon which a registrant may be substantially dependent, such as continuing contracts to
sell the major part of a registrant’s products or services or to purchase the major part of a
registrant’s requirements of goods, services or raw materials. 776 A registrant’s business also may
776

Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(B) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(10)(ii)(B)].

238

be substantially dependent on any franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent,
formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which the registrant’s business depends to a
material extent. 777 Since the item’s adoption in 1965, the Commission has not provided
registrants with additional guidance about how to determine “substantial dependence” or “major
part,” as those terms are used in the exhibits requirements.
To enhance consistency and clarity, we are considering whether to quantify “substantial
dependence” as used in the item. Possible alternatives include establishing a dollar amount or
percentage threshold, similar to the thresholds used in Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(C), as described
below. While an objective requirement may provide clarity for registrants in their efforts to
comply with the exhibit requirements, this approach could inadvertently exclude material
contracts or result in a large number of contracts being filed that contain information that is
neither material nor useful for investors.
Quantitative Thresholds. Unlike subparagraph (B), which relies on a qualitative
threshold, subparagraph (C) provides a quantitative threshold for filing exhibits. Specifically,
Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(C) requires registrants to file any contract calling for the acquisition or sale
of any property, plant or equipment for a consideration exceeding fifteen percent of such fixed
assets of the registrant on a consolidated basis. 778
As originally adopted in 1965, this requirement used a threshold of ten percent of all
fixed assets of a registrant and its subsidiaries. In 1980, the Commission raised the threshold to
fifteen percent, 779 consistent with similar requirements on Form S-1 at the time. In doing so, the
Commission increased the threshold triggering the filing of such an agreement from

239

consideration exceeding “10 percent of all fixed assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries” to
consideration exceeding “15 percent of such fixed assets of the registrant on a consolidated
basis.” 780 In the adopting release, the Commission stated that the higher threshold was consistent
with the purpose of reducing the burden that exhibit filing requirements impose on registrants
“without materially impairing investor information or protection.” 781
In contrast to Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(C), Item 2.01 of 8-K requires a registrant to report the
acquisition or disposition of a “significant amount of assets.” 782 Instruction 4 to Item 2.01
provides that an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to involve a significant amount of
assets (i) if the registrant’s and its other subsidiaries’ equity in the net book value of such assets
or the amount paid or received for the assets upon such acquisition or disposition exceeded ten
percent of the total assets of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries; or (ii) if it involved a
business that is significant. 783 In addition, Form 8-K encompasses any acquisition or disposition,
while Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(C) is limited to the acquisition of property, plant or equipment.
Accordingly, an acquisition could trigger a disclosure requirement under Item 2.01 of Form 8-K
without triggering a requirement to file the related contract under Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(C).
When proposing amendments to Form 8-K in 2002, the Commission sought comment on
whether to remove the ten percent test from Item 2.01 and replace it with the more general

780

See Technical Amendments to Rules, Forms and Schedules; Delegation of Authority to the Director of the
Division of Corporation Finance, Release No. 33-6260 (Nov. 13, 1980) [45 FR 76974 (Nov. 21, 1980)]. This
release corrected the regulatory text adopted in the 1980 Exhibits Adopting Release, which “inadvertently
chang[ed] the materiality test from a percentage of fixed assets to a percentage of all assets.” Id. at 76976.

“materiality” test used in Item 1.01 of Form 8-K. 784 Although several commenters supported
harmonization between the reporting thresholds in Items 1.01 and 2.01, the Commission retained
the ten percent test for Item 2.01, stating its intention that Item 1.01 address a different scope of
agreements than those that trigger disclosure under Item 2.01. The Commission also indicated it
did not believe that the use of two different thresholds will cause undue confusion. 785
We are seeking public input on whether the fifteen percent threshold in Item
601(b)(10)(ii)(C) continues to provide investors with information that is important for an
understanding of a registrant’s business. We are interested in receiving input on whether a
quantitative threshold is useful and, if so, whether fifteen percent of fixed assets is the
appropriate measure. We also seek comment on the scope of contracts covered by subparagraph
(C) and whether we should broaden the scope to better harmonize the exhibit filing requirements
with the Form 8-K disclosure requirements. In addition, we are seeking public input on whether
quantitative thresholds would be appropriate for other types of agreements required to be filed
under Item 601(b)(10)(ii).
v.

Request for Comment

247. Should we adopt additional or different qualitative or quantitative thresholds for
determining when contracts identified in Item 601(b)(10)(ii) must be filed as
exhibits? If so, what should these qualitative or quantitative thresholds be? Why?
248. Should we revise Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(B) to provide qualitative or quantitative
standards for what constitutes “substantial dependence”? Should we define the
term “major part” in addition to or in lieu of defining “substantial dependence”?
784

See 2002 Form 8-K Proposing Release. The Commission proposed retaining the ten percent threshold in
Instruction 4 of Item 2.01 due to “companies’ familiarity with th[e] test.” Id. at 42919.

785

See 2004 Form 8-K Adopting Release.

241

What factors should we consider in developing definitions or quantitative
thresholds? What other alternatives should we consider to clarify which contracts
must be filed under Item 601(b)(10)(ii)?
249. How could we design a quantitative threshold that would accommodate the
diversity of registrants and business models? What would be the disadvantages of a
quantitative threshold? If we used quantitative measures based on registrants’
financial statements, what would be the appropriate measures to use? Alternatively,
should we tie the threshold to a registrant’s market capitalization?
250. Should we provide guidance on the phrase “depends to a material extent” in Item
601(b)(10)(ii)(B)? If so, should we adopt a similar approach to the one discussed in
the preceding request for comment? Alternatively, should our requirements
distinguish franchise or license agreements to use a patent, formula, trade secret,
process or trade name from contracts to sell the major part of a registrant’s products
or services or to purchase the major part of a registrant’s requirements of goods,
services or raw materials?
251. Should we revise Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(C) to either increase or decrease the fifteen
percent threshold for exhibits relating to acquisitions of property, plant or
equipment? Should the threshold continue to be based on fixed assets?
Alternatively, should we eliminate the threshold in favor of a principles-based
requirement, such as “material” or “significant” acquisitions of property, plant or
equipment?
252. Should Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(C) continue to focus on property, plant and equipment?
Should we expand the scope to require registrants to file contracts for the

242

acquisition or disposition of other assets, including intangible assets such as patents,
licenses and other intellectual property? If so, should we consider a disclosure
threshold consistent with Item 2.01 of Form 8-K? Would a different threshold be
more appropriate?

Registrants will, at times, make a voluntary change in accounting principles or practices
when two or more generally accepted accounting principles apply. For example, a registrant
may choose to switch its inventory valuation from last-in, first-out to first-in, first-out. When
such a change occurs, Item 601(b)(18) requires a registrant to file a letter from its independent
accountant indicating whether, in the independent accountant’s judgment, the change is
preferable under the circumstances. 786 No letter is required for changes made in response to a
standard adopted by the FASB that creates a new accounting principle, expresses a preference
for an accounting principle, or rejects a specific accounting principle. 787

Discussion

The precursor to Item 601(b)(18), adopted in 1971, required registrants to describe and
state the reasons for any change in accounting principles or practices that would materially affect

786

Item 601(b)(18) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(18)]. Item 601(b)(18) refers to “independent
accountant.” We also refer to “independent accountant,” as “independent auditor” in this release.

the financial statements filed or to be filed for the current year. 788 Registrants also were required
to file as an exhibit to Form 10-K or Form 10-Q a letter from the independent accountant
approving or otherwise commenting on such changes. 789
In 1975, the Commission amended Form 10-Q to require the accountant’s letter to state
whether the change, in the accountant’s judgment, is preferable. 790 Several commenters objected
to the requirement, stating that no standards existed for judging preferability among generally
accepted accounting principles and that authoritative accounting principles only required
management to justify that a change was preferable. The Commission concluded, however, that
management’s justification for a change in accounting principle must convince an independent
accountant that, in the accountant’s judgment, the new accounting principle is an improvement
over alternative principles. 791 The requirement for a preferability letter was included in Form
10-K in 1980 when the Commission centralized all exhibit requirements within Regulation SK. 792
While Item 601(b)(18) requires an auditor to articulate the preferability of a change in
accounting principle or policy, the nature of the auditors’ statements varies. 793 In addition, there

See 1975 Interim Financial Reporting Release.

791

See id. The Commission based its rationale on the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 (since replaced
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 (ASC Topic 250)), which stated that (i) there is a
presumption that an accounting principle once adopted should not be changed, (ii) that presumption may be
overcome only if the company justifies the use of an alternative acceptable accounting principle on the basis
that it is preferable, and (iii) the burden of justifying a change in accounting principle rests with the company
proposing the change. See Proposals to Increase Disclosure of Interim Results by Registrants.

793

As an example, one auditor’s letter reads: “There are no authoritative criteria for determining a ‘preferable’
presentation method based on the particular circumstances; however, we conclude that such change in the
method of accounting is to an acceptable alternative method which, based on your business judgment to make
this change and for the stated reasons, is preferable in your circumstances.” Another states: “Based on our

244

is no standard methodology for determining preferability. Since 2000, the number of
preferability letters filed in a given year has fluctuated from a high of 108 in 2000 to a low of 57
in 2007. 794
In addition to the exhibit requirement of Item 601(b)(18), disclosure about a voluntary
change in accounting principles is required under Rule 10-01(b)(6) of Regulation S-X and under
U.S. GAAP. In certain instances, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”)
Auditing Standards require auditors to address such changes in their opinions. While U.S.
GAAP and PCAOB Auditing Standards require consideration of a registrant’s change in
accounting principle or practice, they differ from the Commission’s requirements in terms of
nature, timing and extent of reporting by the auditor. We are interested in commenters’ views on
whether existing disclosure requirements provide investors with sufficient information about a
change in accounting principle without the need for registrants to file a preferability letter.
Commission Requirements. Rule 10-01(b)(6) of Regulation S-X requires registrants to
(1) state in the notes to the financial statements the date and reasons for any material accounting
change and (2) file, in accordance with Item 601(b)(18), a letter from the registrant’s
independent accountant as an exhibit to Form 10-Q. 795

review and discussion, with reliance on management’s business judgment and planning, we concur that the
newly adopted method of accounting is preferable in the Company’s circumstances.” Another auditor’s letter
provides: “We believe, on the basis of the facts so set forth and other information furnished to us by appropriate
officials of the Company, that the accounting change described in your Form 10−Q is to an alternative
accounting principle that is preferable under the circumstances.” One preferability letter briefly states: “In our
judgment, such change is an alternative accounting principle that is preferable under the circumstances.”
794

See Audit Analytics, Preferability Letters: A 15 Year Review, Jan. 2, 2015, available at
http://www.auditanalytics.com/blog/preferability-letters-a-15-year-review. Over the last fifteen years the most
common reasons for filing preferability letters have been changes in accounting principles or practices related
to: (1) Goodwill Impairment Measurement Date; (2) Inventory Valuation; (3) Expense Recognition; (4)
Classification; and (5) Benefits Program.

Rule 10-01(b)(6) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.10-01(b)(6)]. Rule 8-03(b)(5) of Regulation S-X is the
equivalent requirement for SRCs. As part of its work to develop recommendations for the Commission for
potential changes to update or simplify certain disclosure requirements, the staff is separately considering Rules

245

U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements about
the nature of and reason for a change in accounting principle, including an explanation of why
the newly adopted principle is preferable. 796 Registrants must report the change in accounting
principle in the financial statements of both the interim and annual period of the change. 797
PCAOB Auditing Standards. PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 6 (“AS No. 6”) requires
auditors to evaluate a change in accounting principle to determine whether, among other things,
the registrant “has justified that the alternative accounting principle is preferable.” 798 AU
Section 722 addresses the review of interim financial statements and requires the auditor to,
among other things, make inquiries of management on changes in accounting principles or
methods of application. AU 722 does not require the auditor to specifically express a view on
the preferability of the change as part of an interim review.
The auditor’s opinion on the annual financial statements must discuss the nature of the
change in accounting principle if the change has a material effect on the financial statements, but
may not necessarily address preferability. 799 Under AU 508, the auditor is not required to opine
explicitly on the preferability of the change. Rather, if the auditor concludes a registrant has
justified that the alternative accounting principle is preferable (as required by AS No. 6 and U.S.

material accounting change. For a description of this project, see Section I.
796

See ASC 250-10-50-1(a). ASC 250-10-45-12 also requires companies to justify the use of an alternative
accounting principle on the basis that it is preferable.

Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 (ASC 250). See supra note 791. AS No. 6 requires the auditor to
assess whether the company has met its burden of justifying the change in accounting principle as set forth in
SFAS No. 154 (ASC 250).

GAAP), then it must include an explanatory paragraph in its report identifying the nature of the
change, if the change has a material effect on the financial statements. 800 If the auditor
concludes that the registrant has not justified the preferability of the alternative accounting
principle, the auditor should consider the matter a departure from U.S. GAAP and, if the effect of
the change in accounting principle is material, issue either a qualified or adverse opinion. 801
Consequently, where the change in accounting principle is material, an auditor’s report without a
qualified or adverse opinion and identifying the nature of the change is akin to the preferability
letter filed under Item 601(b)(18) as both documents convey the auditor’s conclusion that the
registrant has justified that the alternative accounting principle is preferable.
Unlike a preferability letter filed under Item 601(b)(18), the audit opinion will include an
explicit statement as to preferability only when the registrant has not provided a reasonable
justification that the alternative accounting principle is preferable. 802 Additionally, while Item
601(b)(18) requires registrants to file a preferability letter with the first Form 10-Q following the
date of the accounting change, AU 508 requires a statement in the opinion about this change only
in the annual financial statements on Form 10-K. U.S. GAAP requires disclosure about this
change in the notes to the interim financial statements. 803
We are seeking public input on whether to eliminate the exhibit requirement of Item
601(b)(18) in light of the significant overlap with the accounting requirements under U.S. GAAP
and the PCAOB auditing standards. We are also interested in whether requirements in U.S.
GAAP and PCAOB auditing standards are sufficient to alert investors to changes in a registrant’s

accounting policies or principles. We also seek input on the utility of Item 601(b)(18) given the
small number of preferability letters filed and whether the small number of preferability letters
reflects decreased utility and importance of this requirement or if, alternatively, these limited
occurrences make this disclosure more valuable to investors.
c.

Request for Comment

253. Given the development of auditing and accounting standards over the past 40 years,
including the adoption of more prescriptive standards such as SFAS No. 154 804 and
AS No. 6, do preferability letters continue to provide incremental information to
investors that is not otherwise available in either the auditor’s opinion on the annual
financial statements or in the notes to the interim financial statements? If so, is this
incremental information important to investors and how could it be improved?
254. Should we revise Item 601(b)(18) to specify the language that must be included in a
preferability letter? Is there any particular language that gives investors more
insight into the determination that the change is preferable? In light of the lack of a
standard for assessing preferability, do investors receive more information from a
preferability letter than from an auditor’s report? Does it depend on the nature of
the change in accounting principle?
255. Should we eliminate Item 601(b)(18) in light of the current requirements under U.S.
GAAP and the PCAOB’s auditing standards? When a change in accounting
principle is material, is an auditor’s report without a qualified or adverse opinion
sufficient to convey the independent accountant’s conclusion that the registrant has
justified the change to be preferable? Would eliminating the exhibit requirement
804

See supra note 791.

248

affect the independent accountant’s analysis of whether an accounting change is
preferable?
256. Would it be more appropriate for the independent accountant to indicate in the
auditor’s report whether a change in accounting principle is to an alternative
principle that in the auditor’s judgment is preferable under the circumstances?

Subsidiaries and Legal Entity Identifiers

Item 601(b)(21) requires registrants to list all of their subsidiaries, the state or other
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each, and the names under which such
subsidiaries do business. 805 The names of particular subsidiaries may be omitted if the unnamed
subsidiaries, considered in the aggregate as a single subsidiary, would not constitute a significant
subsidiary as of the end of the year covered by the report. 806
A legal entity identifier (“LEI”) is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code that connects to
key reference information that allows for unique identification of entities engaged in financial
transactions. Recently, the Commission has adopted rules requiring disclosure of LEIs in certain

805

Item 601(b)(21)(i) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(21)(i)].

806

Item 601(b)(21)(ii) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(21)(ii)]. This exception does not apply to banks,
insurance companies, savings and loan associations or to any subsidiary subject to regulation by another Federal
agency.
The term “significant subsidiary” is defined by reference to Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.102(w)]. Under that rule, a significant subsidiary means any subsidiary that meets any of the following
conditions: (1) The registrant’s and its other subsidiaries’ investments in and advances to the subsidiary exceed
ten percent of the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently
completed fiscal year (for a proposed combination between entities under common control, this condition is also
met when the number of common shares exchanged or to be exchanged by the registrant exceeds ten percent of
its total common shares outstanding at the date the combination is initiated); or (2) The registrant’s and its other
subsidiaries’ proportionate share of the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the subsidiary exceeds
ten percent of the total assets of the registrants and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most
recently completed fiscal year; or (3) The registrant’s and its other subsidiaries’ equity in the income from
continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary items and cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle of the subsidiary exclusive of amounts attributable to any noncontrolling interests exceeds ten percent
of such income of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter recommended that we require
disclosure of all subsidiaries instead of only significant subsidiaries, asserting that registrants use
the Commission’s significance test to hide material information from investors. 808 This
commenter also recommended requiring disclosure of additional information for each subsidiary,
such as profits earned and number of employees, for investors to understand registrants’
structures and their international strategies, on the grounds that this information is necessary to
understand a registrant’s corporate structure and tax strategy.
Another commenter recommended requiring registrants to disclose each country of
operation and the name of each entity domiciled in each country of operation; the number of
employees physically working in each country of operation; the total pre-tax gross revenue of
each entity in each country of operation; and the total amount of payments made to governments
by each entity in each country of operation. 809 This commenter stated that investors have an
interest in understanding how much of a registrant’s profits are generated from business
operations and how much is a function of tax strategies. This commenter added that a
registrant’s filings should explain to investors the tax liabilities it incurred for the year, how
much it paid, and where. While not addressing Item 601(b)(21) specifically, one commenter
recommended revising the test for determining whether a subsidiary is a significant subsidiary by

value test. 810
We received two comment letters addressing LEIs. 811 One of these commenters
recommended the Commission consider “a commitment to adopt” the LEI endorsed by the G20
as an “authoritative, unique, and common identifier for entities subject to financial regulators,
throughout existing forms.” 812 This commenter specified that a registrant’s list of subsidiaries
would be more useful to investors if the Commission required issuers to disclose each
subsidiary’s LEI. The other commenter recommended the Commission move away from
“proprietary identifiers such as the CUSIP and toward an open source identifier such as the Legal
Entity Identifier” stating this “will make it easier for investors to connect other datasets with
structured data from the Commission.”813

Discussion

Before the adoption of Regulation S-K, Form 10-K required registrants to disclose a list
or diagram of all parents and subsidiaries of the registrant in the text of the annual report. 814 In

810

See ABA 1 (stating that, compared to existing tests, revenue and fair value-based tests are more reliable
indicators of the significance of a tested entity to the registrant, easier to calculate and calculated using more
consistently measured amounts that are not affected by different bases of accounting). See also supra note 806.

812

See Data Transparency Coalition (noting that the “Commission has already proposed requiring the LEI to be
included in security-based swap reports where available, but has not yet committed to use the LEI in its
corporate disclosure system” and that the “Commission should incorporate commonly-used data fields wherever
applicable, starting with the LEI…”).

813

See TagniFi.

814

See, e.g., 1965 Amendments to Form 10-K Adopting Release.
Item 1(a) of former 10-K required disclosure of subsidiaries of “material significance in relation to the total
enterprise represented by the registrant and its subsidiaries, in respect of either (1) the investment in and
advances to such subsidiary, or (2) the sales or operating revenues of such subsidiary, or (3) the essential nature
of the function performed by such subsidiary in the total enterprise represented by the registrant and its

251

addition, for each entity identified, registrants were required to disclose the percentage of voting
securities owned or other bases for control by the immediate parent. 815 Registrants were
permitted to omit the names of particular subsidiaries if those subsidiaries, considered in the
aggregate as a single subsidiary, would not constitute a significant subsidiary. 816 In 1970, the
Commission revised Form 10-K to permit registrants to omit the names of certain consolidated
wholly-owned multiple subsidiaries carrying on the same line of business. 817 This exclusion was
similar to one recommended in the Wheat Report. 818
With the adoption of the integrated disclosure system, the Commission replaced the Form
10-K subsidiary disclosure requirement with a less-detailed requirement to file as an exhibit a list
of subsidiaries and each subsidiary’s jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. 819 This
change was based on the Sommer Report which recommended that Form 10-K contain only a
“list of all subsidiaries,” as opposed to the additional disclosure requirements mentioned above,

subsidiaries.” The item also required certain disclosures of omitted subsidiaries such as the number of
subsidiaries omitted and the total investment of the registrant in such omitted subsidiaries. Id.
815

This disclosure was required under Item 3 of prior Form 10-K. See 1965 Amendments to Form 10-K Adopting
Release.

816

See, e.g., 1965 Amendments to Form 10-K Adopting Release. The item requirement did not define the term
“significant subsidiary.” Registrants were also required to indicate (i) subsidiaries for which separate financial
statements are filed; (ii) subsidiaries included in the respective consolidated financial statements; (iii)
subsidiaries included in the respective group financial statements filed for unconsolidated subsidiaries; and (iv)
other subsidiaries, indicating briefly why statements of such subsidiaries are not filed. Id.

817

See 1970 Revised Form 10-K Adopting Release. Current Item 601(b)(21)(ii) contains substantially the same
exception, permitting the omission of consolidated wholly-owned multiple subsidiaries carrying on the same
line of business, such as chain stores or small loan companies, provided the name of the immediate parent, the
line of business, the number of omitted subsidiaries operating in the United States and the number operating in
foreign countries are given.

818

See Wheat Report at Appendix X-3 (recommending that the names of consolidated totally-held subsidiaries
may be omitted on a Form 10-K, provided that the number of such subsidiaries shall be given together with an
explanation of the basis for omission of names).

such as the bases for control of each subsidiary. 820 In the adopting release, the Commission also
noted that, although a few commenters stated that no such exhibit relating to subsidiaries, in any
form, should be required, most commenters did not object to the exhibit requirement if
insignificant subsidiaries were not required to be disclosed. 821 The Commission agreed with the
commenters that listing all subsidiaries would be too burdensome and adopted the exhibit
requiring only the names of significant subsidiaries. 822 In 1982, the Commission amended the
item to allow registrants to incorporate by reference their lists of subsidiaries if an accurate and
complete list is contained in a document previously filed with the Commission. 823
Disclosure provided under Item 601(b)(21) has decreased in the last several years.
Specifically, the average number of subsidiaries reported by registrants under Item 601(b)(21) is
estimated to have decreased approximately twenty percent in the five years from 2009 to 2014.
However, this decrease is roughly equivalent to the increase observed in the previous five years,
from 2004 to 2009. 824 According to one press report, in recent years certain large registrants
have reduced the number of subsidiaries listed pursuant to Item 601(b)(21) by omitting

820

See 1980 Form 10-K Proposing Release. The Commission also stated that after consideration, it had
determined that the value of parent and subsidiary data is not sufficient to warrant its inclusion in Form 10-K
itself. In addition, it noted its belief that occasional references to such data may be useful. Accordingly, the
Commission proposed a new exhibit requirement rather than including this disclosure in Form 10-K itself. See

260. For purposes of identifying which subsidiaries a registrant may omit from the
exhibit, Item 601(b)(21) relies on the definition of “significant subsidiary” in Rule
1-02(w) of Regulation S-X. Does this definition appropriately exclude subsidiaries
that are not important to investors? Does it exclude any subsidiaries that should be
included? Should we consider a different definition or test for excluding certain
subsidiaries from the exhibit? If so, what factors should we consider?

Legal Entity Identifiers

i.

Discussion

While there are currently many ways to identify entities, there is no unified global
identification system for legal entities across markets and jurisdictions. The LEI is a reference
code to uniquely identify a legally distinct entity that engages in a financial transaction. 827 It is
based on an international standard published by the International Organization for
Standardization in June 2012. 828 Efforts to expand the use of a universal LEI have progressed
significantly over the last few years. 829

827

For further information about LEIs, see Frequently Asked Questions: Global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), Aug.
2012 available at http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/wsr/ofr/Documents/LEI_FAQs_August2012_FINAL.pdf.

See, e.g., The Global LEI System and regulatory uses of the LEI, Nov. 5, 2015, available at
http://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/lou_20151105-1.pdf (progress report by the Legal Identifier Regulatory
Oversight Committee, including an annex listing regulatory actions in the United States, the EU countries, and
eight other countries which require, request, or allow the use of LEIs). The global LEI system currently has
over 419,000 registrations and is growing. See the Global LEI Foundation daily updated “concatenated file,”
which includes all LEIs issued globally and related LEI reference data, available at https://www.gleif.org/en/leidata/gleif-concatenated-file/lei-download# or http://openleis.com.

255

Obtaining an LEI entails both initial registration and annual maintenance fees and is done
through local operating utilities such as the Global Market Entity Identifier utility in the United
States. 830 Fees are not imposed to use or access LEIs, and all of the associated reference data
needed to understand, process, and utilize the LEIs is widely and freely available.
In recent rulemakings, the Commission has prescribed disclosure of LEI, if available, for
parties to certain financial transactions. For example, the Commission recently prescribed
disclosure of an obligor’s LEI, if available, with respect to a rating action involving a credit
rating of an obligor as an entity. 831 In doing so, it stated that use of an LEI can promote accuracy
and standardization of NRSRO data and therefore can further the purpose of allowing users of
credit ratings to compare the performance of credit ratings by different NRSROs. 832 As another
example, the Commission recently adopted an LEI disclosure requirement related to credit risk
retention for open market collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), if an LEI has been obtained
by the obligor, stating that this requirement would allow investors to better track the performance
of assets originated by specific originators. 833 While these recent rulemakings have required LEI

As of December 7, 2015, the cost of obtaining an LEI from the Global Markets Entity Identifier (“GMEI”)
Utility in the United States was $200, plus a $19 per record surcharge for the LEI Central Operating Unit. The
annual cost of maintaining an LEI from the GMEI Utility was $100, plus a $19 surcharge for the LEI Central
Operating Unit. See https://www.gmeiutility.org/frequentlyAskedQuestions.jsp.

Request for Comment

261. Should we require registrants to disclose their LEI and the LEIs of their subsidiaries
(if available) in the list of subsidiaries filed under Item 601(b)(21)? How would
this information benefit investors? Should the industry in which the company
operates or the extent to which the company engages in financial market
transactions affect whether disclosure of LEIs is required? What would be the costs
of requiring disclosure of this information?
262. Should our rules encourage registrants to obtain an LEI? If so, how could we
structure our rules, consistent with our authority under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, to achieve this purpose? For example, should we make obtaining
and maintaining an LEI a condition to any of our existing disclosure

Classification category code and LEI (if an LEI has been obtained by the obligor) of the obligor of the loan or
asset. [24 CFR 267.9].
834

See Regulation SBSR-Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information, Release No. 3474244 (Feb. 11, 2015) [80 FR 14563 (Mar. 19, 2015)] (“2015 Regulation SBSR Release”).

835

In connection with our efforts to modernize reporting and disclosure by registered investment companies, the
Commission proposed new Form N-PORT in May of 2015. Form N-PORT would require certain registered
investment companies to report information about their monthly portfolio holdings in a structured data format.
We proposed inclusion of LEIs in Part A of Form N-PORT and stated that inclusion of this information would
facilitate the ability of investors and the Commission to link the data reported on Form N-PORT with data from
other filings or sources that is or will be reported elsewhere as LEIs become more widely used by regulators and
the financial industry. See Investment Company Reporting Modernization, Release No. 33-9776 (May 20,

text.

257

accommodations or alternatives? Why or why not? If so, should such a condition
be limited to certain types of registrants, such as those operating in financial
services? For registrants that have not obtained an LEI, will these registrants seek
to obtain an LEI in the future absent any regulatory incentive to do so? In addition
to the fees for obtaining and maintaining an LEI, would there be other costs
associated with obtaining LEIs?
263. Some registrants may have hundreds or thousands of subsidiaries or affiliates
operating globally while other registrants have simple corporate structures. If we
required registrants to disclose LEIs (if available) in the list of significant
subsidiaries, should we limit the requirement to larger registrants or larger
subsidiaries, independent of the industry in which the registrant operates? For
example, should we limit the requirement to large accelerated filers or well-known
seasoned issuers (WKSIs)?
H.

Scaled Requirements

1.

Categories of Registrants Eligible for Scaled Disclosure

Over the years, the Commission has developed a disclosure system that provides regulatory
relief in the form of reduced disclosure requirements for certain smaller registrants. Although
initially developed to facilitate smaller companies’ access to the capital markets,836 these reduced or
scaled disclosure requirements also apply to annual and quarterly reports. Currently, registrants are
eligible for scaled disclosure if they qualify as an SRC or an EGC. SRCs are registrants having less
than $75 million in public float (i.e., the aggregate market value of the issuer’s outstanding

836

See Small Business Initiatives Adopting Release and Form S-18 Release.

258

voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates) or, if public float is zero, less than
$50 million in annual revenue in the last fiscal year. 837
In 2012, Title I of the JOBS Act created a new category of issuer called an “emerging
growth company.” Like SRCs, EGCs are eligible for a variety of accommodations, including
scaled disclosure requirements. 838 A company qualifies as an EGC if it did not complete its first
registered sale of common equity securities on or before December 8, 2011 and has total annual
gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. 839 A
company retains EGC status until the earliest of the following:
•

the last day of its fiscal year during which its total annual gross revenues are $1 billion or
more;

•

the date it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Commission’s rules;

•

the date on which it has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the
previous three years; or

•

the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first registered sale of
common equity securities of the issuer. 840
The Commission has specified other categories of registrants for different purposes.

These include: accelerated filers, with a public float of $75 million or more but less than $700

period for EGCs at risk of losing their status as an EGC after the initial filing or confidential submission of their
IPO registration statement but before the IPO is completed. Such companies shall continue to be treated as an
EGC through the earlier of the consummation of the IPO or one year after they would otherwise cease to be an
EGC. See Pub. L. No. 114-94, Sec. 71002, 129 Stat. 1312 (2015).

million; and large accelerated filers, with a public float of $700 million or more. 841 A filer with a
public float of less than $75 million is a “non-accelerated filer.” 842
These categories determine periodic reporting schedules. 843 They also determine the age
requirements for financial statements under Regulation S-X 844 and certain requirements for
audits of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) under Item 308 of Regulation S-K. 845
In addition, accelerated and large accelerated filers are subject to other disclosure requirements,
such as the requirements to disclose their Internet address, 846 information about how they make
their periodic reports available, 847 and a description of any open unresolved staff comments on
their periodic or current reports. 848
The following table summarizes the criteria for determining whether a company qualifies
as an EGC, SRC, non-accelerated filer, accelerated filer or large accelerated filer.

Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2]. Under Rule 12b-2, accelerated filers and large accelerated
filers must also have been subject to the requirements of Exchange Act Section 13(a) or 15(d) for at least 12
months and must not be eligible to use the SRC requirements under Regulation S-K for its annual and quarterly
reports. Id. See also Revisions to Accelerated Filer Definition and Accelerated Deadlines for Filing Periodic

Comments Received

S-K Study. One commenter noted that the $1 billion threshold for EGCs established in
the JOBS Act appeared to be arbitrary and opposed any potential Commission guidance
broadening the definition of EGCs, because it would unnecessarily increase the risks to
investors. 859 Two commenters suggested that the Commission should modify Regulation S-K to
apply to different classes of EGCs, such as those that reach specified revenue levels lower than
$1 billion, or to phase in different requirements after a certain period of time following the
IPO. 860
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter suggested that overreliance on public
float to define SRCs and non-accelerated filers creates a compliance burden for companies with
high valuations that would be considered “small” by any “reasonable observer.” 861 This
commenter recommended revising the definition of SRC and non-accelerated filer to include any
issuer with public float below $250 million, or annual revenues below $100 million regardless of
its public float, to avoid grouping highly valued small companies with little or no revenue with
larger corporations.

Once a registrant becomes a large accelerated filer, it will remain a large accelerated filer unless it determines at
the end of a fiscal year that its public float was less than $500 million as of the last business day of it most

Discussion

The Commission’s practice of providing disclosure accommodations to smaller companies
with less established trading markets dates back to 1979. In providing these accommodations and
determining what categories of registrants are eligible for scaled disclosure requirements, the
Commission has sought to promote capital formation and reduce compliance costs while
maintaining investor protections. 862
Our current system of reporting and registration for SRCs is based on Form S-18, which
allowed an entity that was not previously a reporting company to raise a limited amount of
capital without immediately incurring the full range of disclosure and reporting obligations
required of other issuers. 863 As part of a larger effort to facilitate capital raising by small
businesses and reduce the compliance burdens placed on these companies by the federal
securities laws, the Commission created Regulation S-B in 1992 and rescinded Form S-18.864
Regulation S-B was a new integrated disclosure system modeled after Form S-18 and specifically

862

See, e.g., Form S-18 Release; and Small Business Initiatives, Release No. 33-6924 (Mar. 11, 1992) [57 FR
9768 (Mar. 20, 1992)] (“Small Business Initiatives Proposing Release”).

863

See Small Business Initiatives Adopting Release and Form S-18 Release. Form S-18 was “in the nature of an
experiment” for use by certain non-reporting issuers seeking to register certain offerings of less than $5
million. Registrants using Form S-18 were permitted to provide narrative disclosure somewhat less
extensive than Form S-1 and audited financial statements for two fiscal years instead of the three fiscal
years required in Form S-1. In addition, and to help reduce the expenses resulting from registration and
reporting under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, the Commission allowed Form S-18 registrants to
include this scaled narrative and financial disclosure in their initial Form 10-K. See Form S-18 Release. See
also Section III.A.2.b for a discussion of Form S-18.
Notably, while Form S-18 was intended to facilitate a small business’s access to public capital markets,
eligibility to use the form was not determined by the size of the issuer. After observing the form’s use, the
Commission later expanded the availability of Form S-18. See supra note 78. The offering threshold was raised
to $7.5 million in 1983. See Revisions to Optional Form S-18, Release No. 33-6489 (Sept. 23, 1983) [48 FR
45386 (Oct. 5, 1983)].

864

See Small Business Initiatives Adopting Release. In addition to the small business integrated disclosure system
and forms, the Commission revised Regulation A to, among other things, raise the dollar limit to $5 million in a
12-month period and revised Rule 504 to, among other things, allow for receipt of freely transferable securities
and remove the proscription on general solicitation. Id.

263

tailored to “small business issuers,” which it defined as registrants with annual revenues of less than
$25 million whose voting stock had a public float of less than $25 million.
In 2007, the Commission replaced the “small business issuer” definition with the current
definition for “smaller reporting companies,” which expanded the universe of registrants eligible for
scaled disclosure.865 Unlike the dual eligibility test under Regulation S-B, which required separate
calculations using both public float and annual revenues, the 2007 definition, which remains in
effect today, eliminated the revenue test for most companies. 866 The Commission stated its belief
that this would simplify and streamline the definition while expanding the number of companies
eligible to qualify. The majority of commenters also supported a revenue test only if a company
is unable to calculate public float.
Recently, we have received recommendations to revisit some of our registrant categories
eligible for scaled disclosure, with particular focus on expanding the SRC definition to include a
greater number of registrants. 867 In the S-K Study, the staff recommended consideration of the

865

See SRC Adopting Release. Several of the amendments the Commission adopted in the SRC Adopting Release
originated in recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies (ACSPC),
which the Commission chartered in 2005 to assess the regulatory system for smaller companies. The ACSPC’s
recommendations included establishing a system of scaled securities regulation for “smaller public companies,”
which referred to registrants in the lowest six percent of total U.S. equity market capitalizations, and included:
“microcap companies” which referred to registrants in the lowest one percent of total U.S. equity market
capitalization and would have included registrants with capitalizations below approximately $128 million; and
“smallcap companies,” which referred to registrants in the next lowest five percent of total U.S. equity market
capitalization and would have included registrants with capitalizations between approximately $128 million and
$787 million. See Final Report of the Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, Apr. 23, 2006, available at http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acspc/acspcfinalreport.pdf.

866

See SRC Adopting Release.

867

The Annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation (“Small Business Forum”)
has recommended revising the SRC definition to include a company with a public float of less than $250
million or a company with a public float of less than $700 million with annual revenues of less than $100
million. See e.g., Final Report of the 2014 SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital
Formation, May 2015 (“2014 Forum Report”), available at http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor33.pdf.
Similarly, the Commission’s Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies (“ACSEC”)
recommended the Commission revise the SRC definition to include companies with a public float of up to $250
million to extend regulatory relief to a broader range of smaller public companies, including, among other

264

criteria used to determine eligibility for potential further scaling of disclosure requirements and,
in particular, whether it would be appropriate to scale for companies other than EGCs. The staff
also noted that any determination of which companies should be allowed to scale their
disclosures, how companies should migrate to a standard disclosure regime as they mature, and
the extent to which disclosure of previously undisclosed information should later be required
should reflect the overarching economic principles recommended in the S-K Study. The staff
further recommended consideration of the eligibility criteria for SRCs, as well as the criteria for
accelerated filers and large accelerated filers. 868
We are interested in receiving input on how we should approach the eligibility criteria for
using scaled disclosure. The FAST Act requires the Commission to revise Regulation S-K to
further scale or eliminate disclosure requirements to reduce the burden on a variety of smaller
issuers, including SRCs. 869 In response to this mandate, the staff is currently evaluating, among
other things, the criteria to qualify as an SRC, and expects to make recommendations to the
Commission. Consequently, we are not addressing the existing criteria in this release.

things, the exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor attestation of the registrant’s ICFR. Item
308(b) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.308(b)]. Item 308(b) applies to accelerated filers and large accelerated
filers, both of which definitions exclude issuers that that are eligible to use the SRC requirements in Regulation
S-K. Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2]. Because the definitions of accelerated filer and larger
accelerated filer specify that they do not include registrants that are eligible to use the requirements for SRCs
for their annual and quarterly reports, a change to the threshold for SRCs would extend this exemption even
without a corresponding change to the threshold for accelerated filers.
The ACSEC also has recommended the Commission revise the definition of “accelerated filer” to include
companies with a public float of $250 million or more, but less than $700 million, thereby exempting
companies with public float between $75 million and $250 million from the requirement to provide an auditor
attestation of the registrant’s ICFR. See e.g., Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies

Recommendations”), available at http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/acsec-recommendations-expandingsimplified-disclosure-for-smaller-issuers.pdf.

Request for Comment

264. In the context of registered offerings, the Commission has determined that certain
types of issuers are unsuited for short-form registration or disclosure-related
relief. 870 These issuers include reporting companies that are not current in their
Exchange Act reports, issuers that may raise greater potential for abuse (such as
blank check and shell companies) 871 and issuers that have violated the anti-fraud
provisions of the federal securities laws. Are there types of registrants that would
meet the current criteria for scaled disclosure but are unsuited for providing such
disclosure? If so, which issuers and why? Should we exclude certain types of
registrants from the use of scaled disclosure and if so, what should be the criteria
(e.g., failure to timely file, subject to enforcement actions for disclosure violations
or fraud, being an “ineligible issuer” as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities
Act or disqualified under Regulation A or Regulation D) and the time period of
exclusion?
265. Should we tie eligibility for scaled disclosure to a certain proportion of companies,
such as companies in the lowest one percent of total U.S. market capitalization or
the lowest six percent of total U.S. market capitalization, as previously
recommended by the ACSPC? 872

fraud and manipulation in the penny stock market, and concluded that the Commission's disclosure-based
regulation and review of such offerings protects investors).

See supra note 865.

266

266. Should we allow one or more categories of larger companies, such as companies
with a longer reporting history or more readily available public information to
benefit from scaled disclosure requirements as a means of reducing compliance
costs?
267. The benefits of disclosure may be greater for smaller registrants because
information asymmetries between investors and managers of smaller companies are
typically higher than for larger, more seasoned companies with a large following. 873
However, disclosure requirements may impose disproportionate costs on smaller
registrants, especially if these requirements impose fixed rather than variable
costs. 874 To what extent are the costs imposed by our disclosure requirements fixed
costs that do not scale with the size of a registrant?
2.

Scaled Disclosure Requirements for Eligible Registrants

Registrants that qualify as an SRC or EGC are allowed to provide less detailed
disclosure about their business operations and financial condition and to limit the number of
periods for which disclosure is required. 875 An SRC may limit the description of the
development of its business under Item 101(h) of Regulation S-K to the last three years rather
than the five years required of other registrants. The business description should include the
registrant’s form and year of organization, any bankruptcy proceedings, any material

873

See, e.g., R. Frankel and X. Li, Characteristics of a firm's information environment and the information
asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, 37 J. Acct. Econ. 229, 229-259 (June 2004). See also, L. Cheng, S.
Liao, and H. Zhang, The Commitment Effect versus Information Effect of Disclosure – Evidence from Smaller
Reporting Companies, 88 Acct. Rev. 1239, 1239-1263 (2013).

874

Empirical evidence suggests the imposition of additional disclosure requirements in the past has imposed
disproportionate costs on smaller registrants relative to larger registrants. See supra note 169.

875

SRCs and EGCs may take advantage of additional scaled disclosure requirements and other accommodations,
such as reduced executive compensation disclosure under Item 402(n) through (r) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR
229.402(n) through (r)] that we do not discuss in detail here, as they are beyond the scope of this release.

267

reclassification, merger, sale or purchase of assets outside the ordinary course of business and a
description of the business. The disclosure required in the description of business for SRCs is
less detailed than that required for other reporting companies and does not require information
about seasonality, working capital practices, backlog information and certain material
government contracts. 876 The scaled requirements do, however, call for information not
specifically required for other reporting companies, such as the need for government approval of
principal products and services. 877
SRCs also are required to provide only two years of audited financial statements 878 rather
than the three years required of other companies. 879 To the extent a SRC presents only two years
of financial statement information, they also are permitted under Item 303 of Regulation S-K to
provide MD&A for only these two years. 880
Not all EGCs qualify as SRCs. EGCs are only required to provide two years of audited
financial statements in an initial public offering of common equity securities and may limit their
MD&A to only those audited periods presented in the financial statements. 881 In interpretive

Pub. L. No. 112-106, Sec. 102(b)-(c), 126 Stat. 306 (2012). One study, however, indicated that only fifty-nine
percent of EGCs provided the minimum financial statement disclosures required by the JOBS Act and
voluntarily provided more disclosure. See Ernst & Young LLP, The JOBS Act: 2015 Mid-Year Update, (Sept.
2015), available at

to only those audited periods presented in its financial statements, Division staff has provided interpretive
guidance that Section 102(c) does not permit an EGC to comply with the SRC provisions of Item 303. An EGC

guidance, the Division has stated that in any other offering or in an Exchange Act annual report
or registration statement, an EGC that is not an SRC is required to provide three years of audited
financial statements, except the registrant is not required to include financial statements for any
periods prior to the earliest period presented in its initial public offering of common equity
securities. 882 In addition, EGCs may take advantage of an extended transition period for
complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. 883
SRCs are not required to provide certain line-item requirements in Regulation S-K,
including Item 201(e) (Market price of and dividends on the registrant's common equity and
related stockholder matters – Performance Graph), 884 Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), 885

that is not an SRC is therefore required to include the contractual obligations table required by Item 303(a)(5).

Questions on Title I of the JOBS Act, (May 3, 2012), available at

EGC must provide three years of audited financial statements in an Exchange Act registration statement or
annual report, and therefore its MD&A in such filing must cover the same three-year period. See Division of
Corporation Finance Financial Reporting Manual, Section 10220.1.

Section 71003 of the FAST Act amended Section 102 of the JOBS Act to allow an EGC that is filing a
registration statement (or submitting a draft registration statement for confidential review) under Section 6 of
the Securities Act on Form S-1 or Form F-1 to omit financial information for historical periods otherwise
required by Regulation S-X if it reasonably believes the omitted information will not be required in the filing at
the time of the contemplated offering, so long as the issuer amends the registration statement prior to
distributing a preliminary prospectus to include all financial information required by Regulation S-X at the time
of the amendment. This provision took effect 30 days after the date of enactment of the FAST Act. Section
71003 also directs the Commission to revise the general instructions to Form S-1 and Form F-1 to reflect this
self-executing change. In addition, Section 84001 of the FAST Act requires the Commission to revise Form S1 to permit an SRC to incorporate by reference into its registration statement any documents filed by the issuer
subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement. Pub. L. No. 114-94, Sec. 71003, 129 Stat. 1312

example, an EGC is permitted to limit the selected financial data it includes in a registration
statement under Item 301 to those periods for which audited financial statements are included in
the registration statement. For periodic reports, an EGC is not required to provide the selected
financial data for any periods earlier than those for which financial statements were presented in
the IPO. 891 EGCs are also not required to provide auditor attestations of ICFR and, accordingly,
are not subject to Item 308(b). 892

Comments Received

S-K Study. One commenter encouraged the Commission not to issue guidance or rules to
increase the scope of companies eligible for EGC status or to defer further the application of
internal control requirements, such as the requirement to provide an auditor attestation report, for
EGCs that outgrow their EGC status. 904
Two commenters suggested that EGCs should be exempt from Item 305 disclosure. 905
These commenters specified that companies that have not yet reached the revenue or market
capitalization thresholds that would disqualify them from EGC status are unlikely to face
meaningful market risks. These commenters also recommended eliminating the requirement in
Item 101(c) to disclose the amount of backlog orders believed to be firm for EGCs, stating the
concept of backlog is not a “meaningful metric” for most of these companies. In addition, these
commenters noted that the threshold for agreements that are “immaterial in amount or
significance” in Item 601(b)(10)(ii)(A) is too low for EGCs, because they often enter into
agreements with parties that have a five percent or greater ownership of the company. 906
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter generally supported the concept of
scaled disclosure requirements noting that smaller companies face challenges when preparing
annual reports. 907 Another commenter expressed concerns with a differential disclosure regime
for different sized entities, stating that investors will factor the differences into their price
determinations (i.e., they will price the lack of transparency, clarity and comparability in what

may be perceived to be lower-quality requirements). 908 One commenter recommended that
requirements related exclusively to SRCs should be grouped together under separate headings in
Regulation S-K. 909

Discussion

In simplifying disclosure requirements for small businesses, we seek to facilitate capital
formation without compromising investor protection. Previous Commission efforts in this area
have focused on reducing requirements that impede the formation and growth of small
businesses and, given the nature of these smaller companies, the Commission determined are not
necessary for the protection of investors. 910
The disclosure items formerly required by Form S-18 generally were consistent with the
corresponding items in Form S-1. However, Form S-18 required less extensive narrative
disclosure and simplified financial statements, consistent with Regulation A. Based on input
from public hearings and written comments, the Commission sought to require in Form S-18
only the information that normally would be applicable to those small businesses expected to use
the form. Accordingly, the Commission reduced or eliminated requirements that it determined
were particularly burdensome to small businesses and tended to elicit information that, in the
small business context, was less relevant or less beneficial to investors. 911
For example, Form S-18 did not use the description of business requirement from
Regulation S-K. Instead, Form S-18 provided smaller issuers the flexibility to discuss other
business-related disclosure, such as their dependence on a limited number of customers or
908

275

suppliers (including suppliers of raw materials or financing) and cyclicality of their industry,
only if it would have “a material impact upon the registrant’s future financial performance.” 912
In addition, Form S-18 required two years of audited financial statements prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, 913 similar in content to those required by Regulation A at the time, 914 as
opposed to the more detailed requirements in Form S-1. In adopting Form S-18, the
Commission stated its belief that the simplified financial statements and schedules would result
in costs savings to registrants while providing investors adequate information about these smaller
offerings. 915
Under Regulation S-B, the narrative disclosure requirements generally paralleled those in
Regulation S-K at the time, except that Regulation S-B incorporated the simplified requirements
of Form S-18. The financial information required by Regulation S-B was substantially similar to
that required by Form S-18, except that Regulation S-B also addressed interim financial
statement requirements. 916
In 2007, the Commission eliminated the separate Regulation S-B disclosure requirements
and instead provided scaled disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X. 917
For example, new paragraph (h) to Item 101 of Regulation S-K set forth the alternative disclosure

912

Form S-18 Release at 21570; See also 1977 Regulation S-K Adopting Release.

913

Specifically, Form S-18 required: (1) a consolidated balance sheet as of a date within ninety days prior to the
date of filing; and (2) consolidated statements of income, source and application of funds, and other
stockholders’ equity for the two fiscal years prior to the date of filing. See Form S-18 Release.

914

Until 2015, Regulation A required financial statements to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In 2015,
the Commission revised Regulation A to allow Canadian issuers to prepare their financial statements in
accordance with either U.S. GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards. See 2015 Regulation A
Release.

standards for smaller companies that had appeared in Item 101 of Regulation S-B.918 The
Commission included an index in Item 10 to identify the Items of Regulation S-K containing
scaled disclosure requirements for SRCs. 919
In response to comment letters and the recommendation of the ACSPC, the Commission
revised the requirements in Regulation S-X to require two years of comparative audited balance
sheet data for SRCs, rather than the one year previously required by Regulation S-B. 920 The
Commission noted that the additional balance sheet data would provide a more meaningful
presentation for investors without a significant additional burden on SRCs, because the earlier
year data would be readily available for purposes of preparing the otherwise required statements
of income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’ equity. 921
Unlike Regulation S-B, which required small business issuers to comply with the entire
Regulation S-B disclosure regime, the amendments to Regulation S-K adopted in 2007 permitted
SRCs to comply selectively with the scaled disclosure requirements on an item-by-item basis. 922
The Commission intended the amendments to eliminate redundancies and provide a more
streamlined disclosure system for SRCs. 923
In recent years, the Small Business Forum has recommended that the Commission:
•

eliminate or significantly reduce the extent of XBRL tagging requirements for SRCs; and

918

Item 101(h) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.101(h)].

Id. Where a disclosure requirement applicable to SRCs was more stringent than the corresponding requirement
for other registrants, SRCs were required to comply with the more stringent standard. The SRC Adopting
Release identified Item 404 of Regulation S-K as the only instance where the requirements applicable to SRCs
could be more stringent than the larger company standard.

923

Id.

277

•

permit SRCs to exclude line item-responsive disclosures from their periodic reports if
such disclosures are not material. 924

Similarly, in the last few years, the ACSEC has recommended that the Commission:
•

exempt SRCs from XBRL tagging requirements; 925

•

exempt SRCs from filing immaterial attachments to material contracts; 926 and

•

when adopting new disclosure rules, consider whether such rules place a disproportionate
burden on SRCs in terms of the cost of, and time spent on, compliance with such
requirements, and if so, provide for exemptions from or phase-in periods for such new
rules for SRCs. 927
In 2015, the FAST Act directed the Commission to revise Regulation S–K to further

scale or eliminate requirements in order to reduce the burden on EGCs, accelerated filers, SRCs,
and other smaller issuers, while still providing all material information to investors. 928 Given
these recommendations and the recent legislative directive, we are seeking public input on
whether we should expand or eliminate any of our scaled disclosure requirements to further ease
the compliance burden for smaller registrants and, if so, how we could do so without sacrificing
investor protection.

Request for Comment

268. Are there any disclosure requirements for which scaling is not appropriate?
269. How should we assess whether scaled disclosures are effective at achieving the
Commission’s mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair and orderly markets
and facilitating capital formation?
270. Are there disclosure requirements that are particularly beneficial for investors in
smaller registrants? For example, are there disclosure requirements that elicit
information that is not as readily available outside of smaller registrants’ filings
although this information might be readily available outside of a filing for larger or
more seasoned companies? If so, which requirements and why? Does the
information elicited from smaller registrants by these disclosure requirements
appropriately consider the costs of these requirements to these smaller registrants?
271. Are there additional item requirements that we should consider scaling for SRCs?
Are there any current scaled disclosure requirements that we should scale further or
eliminate entirely?
272. Should we allow EGCs to take advantage of the scaled disclosure requirements
currently available only to SRCs, such as the less extensive requirements for the
description of business set forth in Item 101(h) of Regulation S-K or the elimination
of the contractual obligations table available under Item 303(d) of Regulation S-K?
273. Should we reorganize Regulation S-K, as recommended by one commenter, 929 to
group the requirements related exclusively to SRCs together under separate
headings? Why or why not?
929

See Shearman.

279

274. Should we eliminate or reduce the XBRL tagging requirements for SRCs? What, if
any, XBRL tagging should we require of SRCs?
275. Should we permit SRCs to exclude disclosure that would be responsive to specific
items in Regulation S-K from their periodic reports if such disclosures are not
material? Should we permit SRCs to omit all such disclosure or should we limit
this accommodation to specific items in Regulation S-K?
276. What types of investors or audiences would be affected by further scaling? How?
277. Do our scaled disclosure requirements appropriately consider the costs and benefits
of these requirements to smaller registrants and investors in these registrants? What
savings (or costs avoided) for registrants, including the administrative and
compliance costs of preparing and disseminating disclosure, would likely arise from
scaling additional item requirements? Please provide quantifications of savings and
costs avoided where possible.

Frequency of Interim Reporting

The federal securities laws have required registrants to provide annual reports since
1934. 930 In 1955, the Commission adopted rules requiring registrants to file semi-annual reports
on Form 9-K. 931 In the proposing release for Form 9-K, the Commission stated that
“consideration should be given to requiring reports of certain significant information more
930

As enacted, Section 13 of the Exchange Act required listed companies to furnish annual reports, and if the
Commission required, quarterly reports. John Hanna, The Securities Exchange Act as Supplementary of the
Securities Act, 4 Law & Contemp. Probs. 256,256-268 (1937). Exchange Act reporting requirements were
extended to non-listed registrants with the enactment of Section 12 of the Exchange Act in 1964. See supra
note 14.

931

See Semi-Annual Reports, Release No. 34-5189 (June 23, 1955) [20 FR 4816 (July 7, 1955)]. The Form 9-K
was filed once a year, 45 days after the end of the first half the registrant’s fiscal year. The semi-annual report
required disclosure with respect to sales and gross revenues, net income before and after taxes, extraordinary
and special items, and charges and credits to earned surplus. Form 9-K did not require formal statements of
profit and loss or earned surplus and was not required to be certified.

frequently than annually.” 932 Investors and the securities industry supported the semi-annual
reporting proposal, while registrants opposed it. 933
The Commission has required quarterly reporting since 1970, when it adopted Form 10-Q
to replace the semi-annual report on Form 9-K. 934 However, prior to adopting Form 10-Q, more
than seventy percent of public companies produced quarterly reports, partially in response to
exchange listing standards. 935 As adopted in 1970, Form 10-Q required summarized financial
information and profit and loss information in more detail than was required by Form 9-K,
including data on earnings per common share. In addition, information on a registrant’s
capitalization and stockholders’ equity was also required. 936

In 1981, in connection with its integrated disclosure initiatives, the Commission revised
Form 10-Q to “build upon the annual reporting system to ensure meaningful disclosure on a
continuous basis by making quarterly reporting a mechanism to update the annual report.” 937
The amendments were intended to complement the previously adopted revisions relating to
annual reporting, and included the addition of management’s discussion and analysis of interim
financial information. 938 Other significant additions to Form 10-Q over time have included
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, 939 disclosure controls and
procedures, 940 and risk factors. 941

principal omissions in the Exchange Act reporting system was the absence of a quarterly
summary of basic financial information prepared using reasonably specific standards. 944 The
Wheat Report also concluded that “a regular, quarterly report would be more useful than the
current reports on Form 8-K, which were filed irregularly.” 945 Accordingly, quarterly reports
were intended to provide a mechanism to update the information in an annual report on Form 10K in a more consistent manner and on a regular basis.
The value of quarterly financial reporting has been the subject of debate. 946 Opponents
of quarterly reporting argue that frequent financial reporting may lead management to focus on
short-term results to meet or beat earnings targets rather than on long-term strategies. 947
Consequently, some have argued that quarterly reports should be discontinued 948 or made
voluntary 949 in the United States. 950

Commission should consider the UK’s move toward discontinuing quarterly reporting in pursuing disclosure
reform initiatives. He notes that Legal & General Investment Management, a global investment firm with more
than £700 billion in assets under its management, contacted the boards of London Stock Exchange’s 350 largest
companies to support the discontinuation of quarterly reporting. According to the author, Legal & General
emphasized that short-term reporting “is not necessarily conducive to building a sustainable business” and
“adds little value for companies that are operating in long-term business cycles.” See also David Benoit, Time
to End Quarterly Reports, Law Firm Says, The Wall Street Journal, Aug. 19, 2015, available at;

Other jurisdictions have eliminated quarterly reporting. For example, in the European Union, the requirement
for issuers traded on a regulated market to publish financial information more frequently than annual financial
reports and semi-annual reports was abolished in 2013. See Directive 2013/50/EU of the European Parliament
and of the Council, Oct. 22, 2013, available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-

283

On the other hand, some advocates of frequent reporting, typically on a quarterly basis,
point out that greater frequency improves the timeliness of earnings and reduces information
asymmetry between managers and investors. 951 Others are skeptical of the benefits of
eliminating quarterly reporting requirements. 952 According to one survey of institutional
investors, fifty-eight percent of investors preferred to receive information on a quarterly basis to
confirm or reframe expectations. 953 Some advocates have expressed concern that eliminating
quarterly reporting requirements would result in inconsistent reporting intervals across
registrants and potentially, from period to period. 954 Meanwhile, others argue that delaying a
report by a few months would not fix the problems of short-termism. 955
The value of quarterly reporting may vary by industry or by the size of the registrant. For
example, investors in smaller, capital-intensive technology companies may focus more on

content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013L0050. Following implementation, E.U. member states generally will
require only annual and semi-annual reports. However, an E.U. member state may require issuers to publish
additional periodic financial information if the requirement does not constitute a significant financial burden
and if the required information is proportionate to the factors that contribute to investment decisions. Id.

Similarly, the costs of more frequent reporting may impose a disproportionate burden on smaller
or less capitalized registrants. 957 At the same time, smaller registrants may be more volatile and
quarterly reporting may provide more timely disclosure of performance issues. 958 Additionally,
because smaller, capital-intensive companies may need greater or more frequent access to capital
markets, more frequent reporting may provide greater investor confidence and a lower cost of
capital for these companies. 959

V.

Presentation and Delivery of Important Information
Given the volume, complexity and sophistication of corporate disclosures, the

presentation and delivery of information may play a significant role in investors’ ability to access
and use important disclosure. The Commission’s own disclosure system creates some
fragmentation of information, in both location and time. Registrants provide disclosure on

286

Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, which are filed on EDGAR. Registrants also can provide broad,
non-exclusionary distribution of information under Regulation FD either on Form 8-K or through
press releases, conference calls, or websites. 960 In addition, registrants may use tools such as
cross-referencing and incorporation by reference to reduce repetitive disclosure and present more
streamlined information in each filing. As different investors and third parties likely use
disclosures in different ways, the benefits of different presentation and delivery approaches may
vary.
The S-K Study recommended that the staff consider ways to present information that
would improve the readability and navigability of disclosure. It also recommended that the staff
explore methods to discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. 961
Additionally, the FAST Act requires the Commission to issue regulations permitting registrants
to submit a summary page in their Form 10-K only if each item on the summary page includes a
cross-reference (by electronic link or otherwise) from each item in the summary to the related
material in the Form 10-K. 962
In light of the S-K Study’s recommendations and the recent FAST Act mandate, we are
seeking public input on how our rules can facilitate the readability and navigability of disclosure
documents. We are seeking public input on the use of tools such as cross-referencing,
incorporation by reference, hyperlinks and registrant websites as well as other ways we could
change our disclosure requirements to improve the readability and navigability of registrant

filings. 963 Given the various types of filings and other delivery methods available to registrants,
we also are seeking input on where information should be provided directly and in full, and
where references to the location of the information may suffice. Additionally, we are interested
in whether any required disclosures would be more effective if we required registrants to present
them in a specified format, such as a tabular or graphic presentation, to layer the disclosures by
means of a summary or overview, or to provide certain information as structured data.
A.

Cross-Referencing

In lieu of presenting duplicative disclosure, our rules generally permit registrants to
cross-reference to information in one section of a document to satisfy a disclosure requirement in
another section of the document. Several items in Regulation S-K specify that a company may
include in its financial statements or related notes a cross-reference to certain information in the
non-financial statement disclosure or, conversely, a company may cross-reference from the
disclosure to the financial statements or notes thereto. 964 In addition to allowing for crossreferencing, Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K requires that the substance of the cross-referenced
information be integrated into the discussion to help inform readers of the significance of the
information that is omitted from MD&A. 965

supporting the use of cross-referencing. 966 A few of these commenters recommended clear and
precise cross-references to help investors locate important information in the current volume of
disclosure. 967 Several supported greater use of cross-referencing to eliminate redundancies. 968
One of these commenters supported the use of cross-referencing where appropriate to eliminate
duplicative information but suggested that any referenced document should be considered “filed
with the SEC” for legal and liability purposes. 969 One of these commenters supported crossreferencing so long as the level of auditor assurance was not diminished. 970 This same
commenter noted that many sections within Commission filings are meant to touch on the same
topic but from a different perspective and encouraged the Commission to consider not whether
those sections should be eliminated, but whether they should be tailored to meet the original
disclosure objective.
Some commenters suggested that the Commission require or encourage the use of crossreferences within filings. 971 One of these commenters recommended a new Commission policy

on the avoidance of duplication and the use of cross-references. 972 This commenter
recommended adding instructions to specific Regulation S-K items to encourage the use of
cross-references to avoid duplicative disclosure. 973 This commenter also recommended that the
inclusion of responsive disclosure anywhere in a document should be sufficient to satisfy the
disclosure requirement without the need to include a cross-reference in each item calling for the
information. 974

Discussion

We recognize that an investor may find it easier to access all relevant information in a
single location, even if a portion of the information is repeated elsewhere in the document.
However, repetitive disclosure may obscure relevant information or render it difficult to evaluate
the importance of the information. Below, we consider ways in which cross-references could
potentially be used to reduce redundant disclosure and improve the navigability of lengthy
documents.
a.

Cross-References to Reduce Repetitive Disclosure

Where different disclosure requirements call for the same information in separate parts of
the same document, as discussed above, our rules generally allow the registrant to crossreference to the applicable discussion in another part of the document rather than duplicating the
disclosure. 975 In some instances, Regulation S-K and U.S. GAAP requirements call for similar
972

See ABA 2.

973

See id. (recommending amendments to Items 101(c)(ix) and 303(a)(1), (4) and (5) to state that “cross-references
should be used to avoid duplicative disclosure”).

974

See id. The one exception recommended was for the financial statements and notes to the financial statements,
where cross-references should not be used to satisfy U.S. GAAP requirements. However, where the financial
statements and notes to the financial statements include disclosure that is responsive to Regulation S-K items,
the commenter recommended that the rules allow an appropriate cross-reference to the relevant financial
statement disclosure to satisfy the requirement.

975

See Section V.A.

290

but not identical disclosures. 976 A registrant, subject to certain conditions, may present all the
information required by both requirements in one location, with the second location simply
containing a cross-reference back to the first location. 977 In this way, the related disclosures may
be logically presented together and both requirements met in their separate locations within the
filing while avoiding duplicative or partially duplicative disclosure.
In seeking input on how registrants can most effectively present and deliver important
information, we recognize that information may be relevant to more than one filing or more than
one section of a given filing. Registrants often repeat information in response to different item
requirements in Form 10-K. For example, disclosure about the registrant’s business appears in
the Business section, and parts of that disclosure may be repeated in MD&A, risk factors, and the
footnotes to the financial statements. Repetition of this information may be beneficial in certain
contexts, such as a registrant with a complex organizational structure or business model.
Repetition also may provide users of disclosure with direct access to the information they need in

In the Securities Act context, Commission staff has discouraged registrants from repeating disclosure in
multiple places in a prospectus, instead encouraging the inclusion of a brief overview to provide context in one
section along with a cross-reference to more detailed discussion elsewhere. See also Updated Staff Legal
Bulletin No. 7. In addition, Securities Act Rule 421(b), amended at the same time as our Plain English Rules,
discourages repeating disclosure in more than one location that lengthens the filing without enhancing the
quality of the information. See Note 4 to Rule 421(b) [17 CFR 230.421(b)]; Plain English Disclosure Adopting
Release.
976

See, e.g., Item 103 of Regulation S-K (Legal proceedings) [17 CFR 229.103] and ASC Topic 450
(Contingencies); Item 404 of Regulation S-K (Transactions with related persons, promoters and certain control
persons) [17 CFR 229.404] and ASC Topic 850 (Related Party Disclosures). The staff is separately considering
Item 103 in developing recommendations for potential changes to update or simplify the requirements. For a
description of these recommendations, see Section I.

977

In some instances, a cross-reference is effectively prohibited because it would be inconsistent with the
disclosure requirement. For example, the table of contractual obligations calls for aggregated information in a
single location. A registrant could not satisfy the requirement to provide the data required in the table of
contractual obligations with a cross-reference in MD&A to multiple financial statement footnotes. See Item
303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.303(a)(5)]; and Off-Balance Sheet and Contractual Obligations
Adopting Release.

a consistent location, particularly to the extent that different audiences for disclosure focus on
different filings or sections of filings. In other instances, such repetition can be distracting.
i.

Request for Comment

286. Do investors find that cross-referencing within a filing in lieu of repeating the
disclosure helps them locate important information? Why or why not?
287. Are there specific items in Regulation S-K that would benefit from greater use of
cross-referencing to reduce duplicative disclosure? If so, which items? For these
specific items, should we amend the item to specifically encourage use of crossreferences? Alternatively, and as suggested by a commenter, 978 should we amend
these items to meet the original disclosure objective more effectively?
288. Does cross-referencing negatively affect investors’ ability to use disclosure by
creating inconsistency in the location of information across different registrants and
different filings? To what extent does cross-referencing introduce challenges with
respect to comparative analyses or large-scale automated processing of disclosure?
289. Should we require registrants to provide certain disclosures in the same location
(e.g., under a specific item of the form) in every filing, rather than permitting crossreferencing? If so, which information should be located consistently and where
should that information be located?
290. To what extent does the flexibility to use cross-references reduce compliance and
administrative costs to registrants of preparing and disseminating disclosures?
Please provide quantifications if possible.

See CFA Institute.

b.

Cross-References to Navigate Disclosure

Cross-references can also assist readers in navigating disclosure where disclosures are not
necessarily duplicative but relate to the same topic and may be required in multiple locations
throughout a filing. 979 For example, a discussion in the business section about how a registrant
generates revenue may benefit from a cross-reference to the registrant’s revenue recognition
policy. Similarly, a risk factor that the registrant may not be able to meet payments on its
outstanding debt may benefit from a reference to the debt footnote in the financial statements.
Including these cross-references may help readers obtain a more complete picture by directing
them to other similar information that the reader may not have otherwise reviewed. In addition,
where registrants include a summary or overview of their filing or part of their filing, as
contemplated by the FAST Act, 980 cross-references can assist the reader in locating the more
detailed disclosure included elsewhere in the filing. 981

enable companies to concisely disclose pertinent information …[and] would also enable investors to more
easily access the most relevant information about a company”). For a discussion of layered disclosure, see
Section V.F.

293

c.

Limitations on Cross-Referencing

Registrants’ ability to use cross-references is not unlimited, as the Commission has
discouraged cross-references that render disclosure unclear or incomplete. It also has
acknowledged that vague or excessive cross-references can hinder the reader’s ability to locate
and understand information. 982 Moreover, even specific cross-references may draw the reader
away from key information. 983
While none of our rules prohibit the use of cross-references, there may be instances
where cross-references would not satisfy the requirements or would detract from the readability
or completeness of the disclosure. For example, the Commission has stated that its MD&A rules
are intended to provide, in one section of a filing, a discussion of all the material impacts on the
registrant’s financial condition or results of operations, including those arising from
circumstances discussed elsewhere in the filing. 984
Cross-referencing is contemplated under auditing standards. 985 However, some auditors
have expressed concern that cross-referencing from the financial statements to MD&A may
confuse users on the auditor’s responsibilities and what information the auditor’s report

their own so they can be audited or reviewed, as applicable. 987
In addition, the financial statements are not covered by the PSLRA safe harbor from
liability for forward-looking statements. The PSLRA does, however, cover MD&A
disclosures. 988 While nothing prohibits cross-referencing between the financial statements and,
for example, MD&A, forward-looking statements pulled from MD&A into the financial
statements could “lose” their PSLRA safe harbor. Accordingly, preparers concerned about
forward-looking information may have a disincentive to include a cross-reference in the financial
statements to forward-looking information elsewhere in the document out of concern that doing
so would effectively pull the statements into the financial statements and expose the registrant to
liability without the protection of the PSLRA for such statements. 989

Incorporation by Reference

Rule 12b-23 of the Exchange Act generally allows a registrant to incorporate by
reference information in any part of a registration statement or report in answer, or partial
answer, to any other item of a registration statement or report. 991 In Form 10-K, registrants may
incorporate by reference the information called for by Parts I and II 992 of Form 10-K from the
990

See supra note 984.

991

Exchange Act Rule 12b-23 [17 CFR 240.12b-23]. In addition, Item 10(d) of Regulation S-K provides that
where rules, regulations, or instructions to forms permit incorporation by reference, information may be
incorporated by reference to the specific document and to the prior filing or submission containing the
information. 17 CFR 229.10(d).

992

Subject to some scaled disclosure requirements discussed in Section IV.H above, Parts I and II of Form 10-K
generally require the following information:
Part I: Business, Risk Factors, Unresolved Staff Comments, Properties, Legal Proceedings, and Mine Safety
Disclosures.

296

company’s annual report to security holders. Registrants also may incorporate by reference the
information required by Part III of Form 10-K from the registrant’s definitive proxy statement or
information statement, as applicable. 993 The staff has provided interpretive guidance on Rule
12b-23, stating that within the guidelines specified by the rule, a registrant may incorporate by
reference into its own Exchange Act documents any information contained in the filed
documents of another issuer. 994
Rule 12b-23 provides that where material is incorporated by reference:
•

the material must be clearly identified by page, paragraph, and caption or otherwise;

•

the filing must state that the specified matter is incorporated by reference at the
particular place in the report where the information is required; and

•

except in certain circumstances, a copy of any information incorporated by reference
or the pertinent pages of the document containing such information must be filed as
an exhibit to the report where it is incorporated by reference. 995

Part II: Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities, Selected Financial Data, MD&A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting

993

Subject to some scaled disclosure requirements discussed in Section IV.H, Part III of Form 10-K generally
requires the following information: Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance; Executive
Compensation; Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder
Matters; Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence; and Principal Accounting
Fees and Services.
To incorporate Part III information into the Form 10-K, the proxy statement or information statement must be
filed not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by the Form 10-K See General Instruction
G(3) to Form 10-K.

For exhibits, Rule 12b-32 allows any document or part thereof filed with the Commission
to be incorporated by reference as an exhibit to any report filed with the Commission by the
registrant or any other person. 996 Registrants regularly satisfy exhibit filing requirements by
relying on Rule 12b-32 to incorporate exhibits by reference to previously filed reports or
registration statements. 997 Rule 12b-32 also allows a registrant to meet the exhibit filing
requirement of Rule 12b-23(a)(3) by incorporating by reference as an exhibit the document or
portion of the document containing the information incorporated by reference under that rule. 998

Discussion

The Commission has a long history of permitting incorporation by reference. 1001
Incorporation by reference was a key component of Form S-3, introduced as part of the
integrated disclosure system, based on the efficient market theory. 1002 The Commission
envisioned that its integrated disclosure system would eliminate duplicative disclosure by
allowing registrants to incorporate by reference information filed in Exchange Act reports into
Securities Act registration statements. 1003 The Commission also acknowledged that

1001

See Release No. 34-51 (Nov. 27, 1934) [not published in the Federal Register] (adopting the first Exchange
Act rule, JB4, allowing registrants to incorporate by reference as an exhibit any document previously or
concurrently filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act); see also Registration and Reporting Rules
and Rules of General Application [13 FR 9321(Dec. 31, 1948)] and 1948 Adoption of Amendments to General
Rules and Regulations Release (adopting early versions of Rules 12b-23 and 12b-32).

1002

See 1982 Integrated Disclosure Adopting Release at 11382 (stating that “Form S-3, in reliance on the efficient
market theory, allows maximum use of incorporation by reference of Exchange Act reports and requires the
least disclosure to be presented in the prospectus and delivered to investors” and that “[g]enerally, the Form S-3
prospectus will present the same transaction-specific information as will be presented in a Form S-1… The
prospectus will not be required to present any information concerning the registrant unless there has been a
material change...which has not been reported in an Exchange Act filing or the Exchange Act reports
incorporated by reference do not reflect certain restated financial statements or other financial information.”).
For a description of the efficient market theory, see supra note 163.

1003

See 1980 Form 10-K Proposing Release.
Certain Commission forms allow historical incorporation by reference, meaning a registrant or issuer may
incorporate information by reference to previous filings. Examples include Exchange Act Form 8-A, which
allows for incorporation by reference of the description of a registrant’s securities if a comparable description is
contained in a prior filing. See Instruction to Item 1 of Form 8-A [17 CFR 249.208a]. Certain Securities Act
registration statements also permit historical incorporation by reference, such as Form S-3, Form S-4, and Form
S-11, which allow incorporation by reference of previous Exchange Act filings into the prospectus. See Item
12(a) of Form S-3 [17 CFR 239.13]; Item 11(a) of Form S-4 [17 CFR 239.25]; Item 29(a) of Form S-11 [17
CFR 239.18].
Certain Securities Act forms allow for forward incorporation by reference by certain issuers, where an issuer is
permitted to forward incorporate by reference to Exchange Act reports filed in the future. Examples include
Form S-3 and Form S-4. See Item 12(b) of Form S-3 [17 CFR 239.13]; Item 11(b) of Form S-4 [17 CFR
239.25]. In addition, the FAST Act recently directed the Commission to revise Form S-1 to permit SRCs to
incorporate by reference to future filings. Pub. L. No. 114-94, Sec. 84001, 129 Stat. 1312 (2015); See also
FAST Act Interim Rules Release.
Given the scope of this release and its focus on Exchange Act periodic reports, the discussion here generally is
limited to historical incorporation by reference.

299

incorporation by reference has limitations, as there is no assurance that the mere reference to
incorporated information will be meaningful to an investor or potential investor. 1004
The Commission initially limited eligibility to incorporate by reference in registration
statements to seasoned, exchange-traded companies based on the likelihood that the information
in the incorporated filings has been thoroughly analyzed and reflected in the price or rating of the
securities offered. For these types of registrants, the Commission concluded that the cost savings
to registrants of not having to repeat or refile information disclosed elsewhere outweighed the
risk to investors that the stock price does not reflect the omitted information. 1005
The integrated disclosure system also gave rise to the current structure of Form 10-K that
allows registrants to incorporate Parts I and II from the annual report to shareholders and Part III
from the definitive proxy statement. 1006 For periodic reports, registrants regularly incorporate by
reference the information required by Part III of Form 10-K from their definitive proxy
statements. Fewer registrants incorporate Parts I and II of Form 10-K from their annual reports
to shareholders. 1007 This likely is because many companies have eliminated their separate annual
report to shareholders and instead use Form 10-K to satisfy their Rule 14a-3 requirements. 1008

1004

See 1980 Form 10-K Proposing Release.

1005

See id.

1006

See 1980 Form 10-K Adopting Release. Although Form 10-K was amended in 1980 to reflect the current
structure, the Commission has allowed some form of incorporation by reference from the annual report to
shareholders to satisfy requirements of Form 10-K since 1942. See Amendment to Forms for Registration and
Filing Annual Reports [7 FR 10653 (Dec. 22, 1942)] and Release No. 34-3347 [not published in the Federal
Register] (Dec. 18, 1942).

1007

Based on data compiled by DERA, in calendar year 2014 approximately two percent of registrants incorporated
some portion of the information required in either Part I or Part II of their Form 10-K from their annual report to
shareholders, with more registrants incorporating Part II information than Part I information.

For exhibits, registrants often incorporate by reference exhibits from prior filings into their
periodic reports.
Advancements in technology support greater use of incorporation by reference. In
Securities Offering Reform, the Commission expanded the use of incorporation by reference
conditioned on the registrant making its incorporated Exchange Act reports and other materials
readily accessible on a website maintained by or for the registrant. 1009 By conditioning the
ability to incorporate by reference on the ready availability of a registrant’s incorporated
Exchange Act reports and other materials on its website, the Commission sought to provide
investors with the ability to obtain the information from those reports and materials at the same
time that they would have been able to obtain the information if it were set forth directly in the
registration statement. 1010

Request for Comment

296. To what extent does including previously disclosed information along with recent
developments in a single self-contained filing facilitate an investor’s understanding
of a registrant’s disclosure? Does repeating information that previously has been
disclosed hinder an investor’s ability to identify information that has changed since

and that “[t]he traditional annual report may have been all but killed off by the austere 10K-wrap”).

materials are available and access to the reports or other materials is free of charge to the user. See General
Instruction VII.F. to Form S-1; General Instruction VI.F to Form F-1. The Commission noted that this manner
of access was similar to those for disclosure of website access to an accelerated filer’s Exchange Act reports.
See Securities Offering Reform Release. In adopting the requirements for accelerated filers, the Commission
noted that, while these reports were already available through the Commission website, access through
company websites was still desirable to encourage the availability of information in a variety of locations and to
foster best practices for making that information broadly accessible. See Acceleration of Periodic Report Filing
Dates and Disclosure Concerning Website Access to Reports, Release No. 33-8128 (Sept. 5, 2002) [67 FR

the registrant’s last report? Does providing previously disclosed information along
with information that is new or has changed better enable investors to consider the
changes in context? If so, should we structure our requirements to elicit disclosure
that highlights changes from a registrant’s last report and provides a comprehensive
discussion in a single location?
297. Should we expand or limit registrants’ ability to incorporate by reference? Why or
why not? Does incorporation by reference make the disclosure more or less
readable?
298. Are there particular filings or sections of filings that should remain direct sources of
disclosure information, rather than permitting incorporation by reference? If so,
what information should be located consistently and in which filings? Which
sections of those filings should contain the information? For example, is it more
important for an investor to have information included directly and in full in a
Securities Act registration statement than it is in an Exchange Act filing?
299. Should our requirements to provide historical and recent information within a single
self-contained filing differ for registrants of different sizes, development stages,
reporting histories or other factors?
300. Should registrants be permitted to incorporate by reference historical information
from prior filings in lieu of presenting prior years’ information in the Form 10-K?
If so, when or how frequently should we require registrants to present or refresh
their complete core disclosure? Should we limit this approach to certain categories
of registrants and, if so, how should we determine which categories would be
eligible?

Hyperlinks

Under Rule 105 of Regulation S-T, a registrant may include hyperlinks within a filing,
such as a table of contents that hyperlinks to specific sections in a filing or a cross-reference that
hyperlinks to another part of a filing. 1011 Rule 105 also allows registrants to include hyperlinks
to exhibits within the same filing or hyperlinks to other Commission filings. 1012 However,
registrants may not include hyperlinks to information outside the EDGAR system, such as
external websites. 1013
Of the two formats that are generally accepted by the EDGAR system, the text-based
American Standard Code for Information Interchange (“ASCII”) and hypertext markup language
(“HTML”), 1014 only the HTML format accommodates hyperlinks. Currently, the vast majority

The EDGAR system also accepts PDF documents, but will not accept PDF documents containing hyperlinks.
See, e.g., EDGAR Filer Manual, Vol. I, v. 24 (Dec. 2015) at 3-27. Most PDF documents are considered
unofficial copies, and PDF documents are permitted as official filings only in limited circumstances. See Rules

of registrants file in HTML format. 1015 Many of these registrants include hyperlinks within their
filings.
If a registrant includes a hyperlink in its filing, whether or not the link is permitted by
Commission rules, the information in the linked material is not considered part of the filing for
determining compliance with disclosure obligations. However, inclusion of the link will cause
the registrant to be subject to the civil liability and antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws for the information contained in the linked material. 1016 Similarly, if a registrant hyperlinks
to another hyperlink, the registrant will be treated as making all the hyperlinked material its own
for liability purposes. 1017

Discussion

In 2000, the Commission stated that it is appropriate for registrants to assume liability for
hyperlinked material as if it were part of the filing, because the use of hyperlinks in filings is
voluntary and filers need not hyperlink to material that they do not wish to be understood as
having adopted as their own. The Commission cautioned registrants not to use hyperlinks if they
are not prepared to accept responsibility for the hyperlinked material. 1021
The EDGAR system initially permitted hyperlinks only to different sections within a
single document. In 2000, when the Commission expanded the permissibility of hyperlinks to
allow hyperlinks to other documents and exhibits filed on EDGAR, the Commission stated that
hyperlinks alone should not satisfy the disclosure requirements. 1022 The Commission noted that
it would not be appropriate for a registrant to use hyperlinks effectively to use incorporation by
reference when it is not permitted. 1023 In addition, when the form or rule does permit
incorporation by reference, the registrant must comply with all of the form or rule requirements
for such incorporation by reference. 1024
The Commission’s rationale for limiting the use of hyperlinks was that readers might be
unable to understand the content of the filing without accessing numerous hyperlinks and that
readers would be unable to print the filing as an integrated whole. 1025 In 2008, in its guidance on

1021

See 2000 EDGAR Release.

1022

See id.

1023

See id. (stating that a filer would be permitted to use hyperlinks to optional information for the convenience of
the reader, but could not omit information required within the filing by providing it through a hyperlink).

1024

For example, the filing must contain a statement that the document is incorporated by reference, whether or not
there is a hyperlink. As another example, Form 10-K may incorporate information from a registrant’s annual
report to security holders, so long as the information is filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-K. This exhibit is
needed even if the information also is provided by hyperlink. See Section V.B for a discussion of incorporation
by reference.

305

the use of company websites, the Commission stated that the inability to print disclosure
designed for interactive viewing and not for reading outside the electronic context, is not
inherently detrimental to its readability. 1026 However, it also noted that certain disclosure would
continue to be required in a format convenient for both reading online and printing. 1027
Since this 2008 guidance, there has been a significant increase in the use of the Internet
as a tool for disseminating information. As of 2014, eighty-seven percent of the U.S. population
uses the Internet, up from seventy-four percent in 2008. 1028 In addition, recent data shows that
most investors, even those who rely on financial advisors, use the Internet to conduct
transactions and gather financial information. 1029 There have also been advancements in the
types of technologies that can be used to report and analyze information. 1030 In light of these
developments, we are interested in learning whether the Commission’s prior concerns about
disaggregated disclosure remain relevant. We are seeking public input on whether and how to
revise our rules to take advantage of the Internet as a source of information about registrants.

1026

See 2008 Website Guidance.

1027

See id. (stating that the Commission did not think it was necessary that information appearing on company web
sites satisfy a printer-friendly standard unless our rules specifically require it, such as the notice and access

reading online and printing on paper). For a discussion of disclosure on company websites, see Section V.D.

Request for Comment

303. Should we consider revising our rules to permit registrants to include external
hyperlinks in their filings? Should we consider permitting registrants to include
external hyperlinks in their filings to satisfy disclosure obligations? Why or why
not? What would be the benefits and challenges of such a requirement? 1031
304. Would increased use of hyperlinks and further disaggregation of company
disclosure into multiple filings hinder the quality or readability of disclosure? If so,
how? What information, if any, should we require in a single filing or location?
305. Should we require registrants to include hyperlinks with any cross-reference to
specific information or a specific section within a filing? Why or why not? What
would be the benefits and challenges of such a requirement? In particular, what
would be the costs or savings in compliance and administrative costs to registrants
of required hyperlinks?
306. As suggested by one commenter, 1032 should we eliminate the requirement under
Rule 12b-23 to attach, as an exhibit, information incorporated by reference from
another filing, so long as the registrant includes in the text a hyperlink to the other
filing?
D.

Company Websites

In certain circumstances, our rules and forms either permit or require the use of company
websites as a means to provide information to investors. Depending on the circumstances,
company websites may serve as a supplement to material filed or furnished via EDGAR, as an

alternative to such materials, or as a stand-alone method of providing information to investors
independent of EDGAR. 1033 Our rules do not permit a registrant to satisfy disclosure
requirements by incorporating by reference to information on registrant websites. 1034
When a company website supplements Commission filings, company information is
available both on EDGAR and on the company’s website. We have encouraged or required
supplemental use of websites to make information more broadly accessible. For example,
registrants are required to:
•

disclose their website addresses, if available, in annual reports on Form 10-K and state
whether their Exchange Act reports are available on their websites; 1035

•

make their Exchange Act reports and documents incorporated by reference available on
their website as a condition to incorporation by reference of previously filed reports into
prospectuses filed as part of registration statements on Form S-1 or Form S-11; 1036

1033

See 2008 Website Guidance. More recently, in April 2013, in connection with an investigation of the use of
social media to announce operational metrics, the Commission provided guidance to issuers on how the 2008
Website Guidance and Regulation FD apply to disclosure made through social media channels. See Report of
Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act: Netflix, Inc. and Reed Hastings, Release

satisfy the requirement to make filings available on their websites by “including hyperlinks directly to the
reports or other materials filed on EDGAR or on another third-party website where the reports or other

corporate website to post on its website all Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed with respect to its equity securities by the end
of the business day after filing. The Commission noted that “One objective of the amendments is to encourage
availability of this information in a variety of locations, so that it is broadly accessible.” See Mandated

non-GAAP financial measures orally, telephonically, by webcast, by broadcast, or by similar
means may satisfy Regulation G by posting the required reconciliation on its website and
disclosing the location and availability during the presentation. 1042
In addition, Item 406(c) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of a registrant’s
code of ethics, requires the registrant to: file a copy of its code of ethics as an exhibit to its
annual report; post the text of its code of ethics on its website and disclose in its annual report its
website address and the fact that it has posted its code of ethics on its website; or undertake in its
annual report to provide any person a copy of its code of ethics upon request. 1043 The
Commission originally proposed to require a registrant to file a copy of its code of ethics as an
exhibit to its annual report. 1044 At adoption, the Commission opted for greater flexibility, citing
commenters’ concerns that some codes are extremely lengthy and therefore would be difficult to
file electronically on EDGAR and noting that many registrants already post their codes on their
websites. In addition, our rules require disclosure on either Form 8-K or the registrant’s website
of any change to or waiver of its code of ethics for its senior financial officers. 1045
Only in very limited circumstances do our rules allow a company’s website to serve as a
standalone method of providing information to investors wholly independent of EDGAR. Rules

Disclosure Effectiveness. One commenter recommended that particular focus should be
given to adapting disclosure practices to a more technologically-driven marketplace. 1046 Two
commenters suggested that registrants be permitted to use their websites to satisfy certain
disclosure requirements such as those relating to their business, management team, and
board. 1047 One of these commenters recommended that registrants use their website as a
repository for basic corporate documents, such as a company’s certificate of incorporation or
bylaws. 1048 Another commenter opposed the delivery of information using a registrant’s website
because it would “raise issues, including liability matters, certifications, preservation of past
disclosure, comparability and accessibility that would need to be addressed.” 1049 Another
commenter stated that “having some information on a company website and other information on

information will be, and information provided on company websites is often difficult to find.” 1050
Another commenter acknowledged the potential efficiency to be gained through use of
the Internet and electronic delivery, but suggested that, to protect the interests of investors who
rely on paper delivery, the Commission should take steps to protect the interests or access of
investors who depend on non-electronic access to information. 1051

Discussion

As noted by several commenters, today’s technology provides virtually instant access to
information through a variety of sources outside of EDGAR, including company websites. 1052
The Internet has become a primary source of information for investors. We are seeking public
input on whether and the extent to which investors benefit from requiring disclosure in a filing
when the information is readily available on the registrant’s website. We are also interested in
what additional investor protections we should consider in the event we allow registrants to
exclude required information from filings when the information is otherwise provided on their
websites, such as requirements for registrants to preserve disclosure provided on their website.
Currently, investors typically can access registrants’ public filings since 1996 through
EDGAR. 1053 Investors may request other public filings or records from the Commission. 1054

Registrants were phased into EDGAR over a three-year period ending May 6, 1996. As of that date, all
domestic registrants were required to make their filings on EDGAR, except for filings made in paper because of
a hardship exemption. See Rulemaking for EDGAR System, Release No. 33-7122 (Dec. 19, 1994) [59 FR

However, information posted on company websites may change frequently and may not remain
available to investors. Certain of our rules that allow registrants to disseminate information
through their websites in lieu of including that information in a filing also require the registrant
to maintain that information for a designated period of time. For example, registrants posting
their code of ethics on their website under Item 406(c) are required to make the information
accessible for as long as the registrant remains subject to Item 406. 1055 Similarly, registrants
required to post Exchange Act Section 16(a) filings on their websites are required to keep those
filings accessible on their websites for at least a 12-month period. 1056 As another example, while
Regulation G does not specify how long a registrant must keep disclosure available on its
website, the Commission encourages companies to provide ongoing website access to this
information for at least a 12-month period. 1057
For historical information available on company websites, the Commission has stated
generally that “the fact that investors can access previously posted materials or statements on a
company’s Web site does not in itself mean that such previously posted materials or statements have
been reissued or republished for purposes of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,
that the company has made a new statement, or that the company has created a duty to update the
materials or statements.” 1058 To help assure that investors understand that the posted materials or
statements speak as of a date or period earlier than when the investor may be accessing the posted

1056

Exchange Act Rule 16a-3(k) [17 CFR 240.16a-3(k)]. In addition, the Commission has stated that the
availability of historical issuer information provides investors with more readily accessible information about
the issuer and that issuers should be able to maintain historical information on their website so that information
will remain accessible to the public but will not be considered to be reissued or republished for purposes of the
Securities Act. See Securities Offering Reform Release.

materials or statements, the Commission has stated that historical or previously posted materials or
statements should be:
•

separately identified as historical or previously posted materials or statements, including, for
example, by dating the posted materials or statements; and

•

located in a separate section of the website containing previously posted materials or
statements. 1059

In other contexts, the Commission has expressed concerns about whether information disclosed
on company websites would be adequately preserved for purposes of the reporting and liability
provisions under the federal securities laws. 1060
Information on company websites currently is subject to some but not all Exchange Act
liability provisions. Anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Exchange Act
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, apply to statements made on a company website. If a registrant
were to make a false or misleading statement of a material fact on its website in connection with
the purchase or sale of a security, the registrant could face liability under Section 10(b) and Rule
10b-5. These anti-fraud provisions also apply in certain circumstances to third-party information
available via hyperlink on a company website that could be attributable to the company, in the
same way they would apply to any other statement made by, or attributable to, a company. 1061
The reporting provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1
and 12b-20 generally do not apply to disclosures on company websites. However, if a company
fails to satisfy a website disclosure option that relieves it of its obligation to file or furnish an

Exchange Act report, an action could be brought under the Exchange Act reporting provisions
based on the company’s failure to file the report. 1062 For example, in the event a company fails
to make public disclosure of information as required by Regulation FD, 1063 that issuer would
violate Regulation FD as well as Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 1064
Material incorporated by reference into a filed document is subject to liability under
Section 18 of the Exchange Act, which provides a private cause of action for a false or
misleading statement of material fact in a filed document. 1065 Material appearing solely outside
Commission filings, such as on a registrant’s website, cannot be incorporated by reference into a
registrant’s filings 1066 and would not be subject to Section 18 liability.
Liability under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act applies to information in
Exchange Act filings when it is incorporated by reference in a registration statement or
prospectus. Section 11 imposes liability on an issuer for any untrue statement or omission of a
material fact in a registration statement. Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act imposes similar
liability for material misstatements or omissions in a prospectus or oral communication that
constitutes an offer. This liability also applies to information incorporated by reference, where
permitted, from Exchange Act filings filed after the registration statement. Under our current
rules, disclosure provided on a registrant’s website rather than in an Exchange Act filing cannot
be incorporated by reference into a registration statement or prospectus. Accordingly, it would

reference to Commission filings, or should we allow registrants to incorporate
information from their websites?
308. Are there challenges investors may face in using sources outside registrant filings to
obtain information about a registrant? If so, what are these challenges? Would
investors seeking information on a registrant’s website rather than in its filings
require specialized equipment, knowledge or expertise that some investors may not
have? What would be the impact on investors who want to receive materials in
paper? 1067 What would be the impact on investors or third parties who engage in
automated processing or large-scale analysis of disclosure on EDGAR?

incorporated information? How should it be preserved in the event the registrant
exits the reporting system or goes out of business? What would be the impact on
the reporting and liability provisions of the federal securities laws if this
information is not preserved as required?
312. Are there categories of business or financial information that we should permit
registrants to disclose by posting on their websites in lieu of including in their
periodic reports?

what are the benefits of continuing to require disclosure of the same information in
the registrant’s filings? What would be the impact on registrant liability, accuracy
of reported information or investor protection generally if we eliminated disclosure
requirements for information that investors routinely access from websites?

and compliance costs of preparing and disseminating disclosure? Please provide
quantifications of expected changes in costs if possible.

Specific Formatting Requirements

The business and financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K generally do not
specify the precise layout or format for disclosure. 1068 In adopting the earliest Exchange Act
report forms, the Commission’s emphasis was “on substance rather than on form,” giving
companies “wide latitude in the manner of presenting the required data.” 1069 Current Forms
10-K and 10-Q specify that they are not a blank form to be filled in but a guide to be used in
preparing the report. 1070

1068

This section discusses formatting requirements that call for a standardized visual presentation or layout of
disclosure within a registrant’s ASCII or HTML filing. For a discussion of structured disclosures and our
requirements for specific data formats to facilitate the extraction of information into standardized formats, see
Section V.G.

1070

See General Instruction C.1 to Form 10-K [17 CFR 249.310]; General Instruction C.1 to Form 10-Q [17 CFR
249.308a]. In addition, Form 10-K cites Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, which requires a company to include, in
addition to any information specifically required to be included in a statement or report, any further material
information necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are

318

While our general approach allows registrants to use discretion in the overall layout of
their disclosure, a few items prescribe the format for disclosure. In some cases, basic
formatting requirements may be standardized, such as the prescribed location, order or title of
required disclosure. For example, the structure of our periodic reports and related rules require
registrants to include the numbers and captions of all items in the relevant form. 1071 Some of our
more specific requirements seek to elicit standardized information, such as prescribed tables with
standardized rows and columns, such as the tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in Item
303(a)(5). 1072

placement or presentation of registrant disclosure to facilitate identification of current, material
information. 1073 Two commenters suggested that prior to creating and implementing any new
system, the Commission should encourage registrants to experiment with different formats in
periodic reports, rather than strictly following the prescribed format of disclosure items in the
applicable form. 1074 One of these commenters stated that this would support reaching (and

suggested that our rules should incorporate the “growing body of scholarship around user
experience” to improve the utility of corporate reporting. This commenter specified that some
information lends itself well to graphic presentation and that, where possible, reporting
companies should use graphics to communicate key trends and practices to investors quickly and
clearly. Another commenter suggested that we encourage registrants to base the order,
prominence and extent of disclosures presented on the materiality of the matter covered by such
disclosures. 1076 One commenter recommended a more complete and descriptive table of
contents to help investors navigate the current volume of disclosure. 1077 One commenter stated
that disclosure in “[p]lain language, clear formatting, no footnotes, no jargon, complete
information without having to jump to another site are critical and doable.” 1078 Some
commenters supported the concept of a “company profile” or “company tab” discussed in the SK Study. 1079
One commenter recommended disclosure in Q&A form for certain common risk factors,
with standardized questions for all registrants allowing only for potential responses of “yes,”
“no,” or “NA.” 1080 Another commenter provided results of a survey that it conducted showing
that a “substantial majority of respondents (65 percent) indicated that the increased use of tables

and charts would be very important to improving financial reporting.” 1081 This commenter stated
that investors want quantitative tables with entity-specific information appropriately
disaggregated and suggested that this information should be supported by “qualitative
explanations that are not littered with boilerplate or generic language.” 1082 This commenter
further stated that standardization of quantitative disclosures would enhance comparability over
time and among firms. 1083 Similarly, another commenter recommended that companies consider
the use of “pie charts” and “bar charts” to enhance certain disclosure. 1084

Discussion

A standard layout, format, or style requirement may enhance the comparability of
disclosures across periods and across issuers and registrants. Such comparability and
consistency may reduce the costs of acquiring information, increase valuation accuracy, and
enhance investment efficiency. 1085 A standardized presentation may also reduce the ability of
registrants to choose presentation formats that could highlight more favorable disclosures and
obscure less favorable ones.
However, flexibility in the presentation of disclosure may enhance the ability of
registrants to tailor disclosure to their individual circumstances and investor bases. Flexibility
in presenting disclosure could allow registrants to more effectively communicate the
information most critical to understanding their particular company as prescriptive presentation

Request for Comment

319. Do current disclosure requirements appropriately consider the need for both
standardization and flexibility in presentation? If not, how could we change our
requirements?
320. How could we facilitate or encourage better presentation of disclosure by
registrants?
321. Would further prescribing the order and format for presenting information in annual
or quarterly reports improve readability or increase comparability across
registrants? Would such standardized requirements enhance the ability of investors
and third parties to use disclosures, including for large-scale processing and
analyses, in a more timely and efficient way?
322. Is there particular information that investors would prefer we require registrants to
present in a specific order or in a particular section of the document? If so, which
information should be so presented? What would be the advantages or
disadvantages of such an approach?
323. Do item numbers and captions improve the clarity, navigability or overall
effectiveness of disclosure? Should we revise our rules to reduce or eliminate the

322

requirement to include the item numbers and captions from any of our forms? Why
or why not?
324. Should we revise any of our current disclosure rules to require a standardized
tabular or graphic presentation rather than, or in addition to, the narrative disclosure
we currently require? Which disclosures could be improved by a requirement for
tabular or graphic presentation? Would such a presentation improve comparability
of disclosure across registrants? Does increased comparability improve
transparency or is it otherwise beneficial to investors? What would be the
advantages or disadvantages of such an approach?
325. Should we require registrants to present certain disclosures in question-and-answer
format? If so, what information would be appropriate for this format? Should we
require or permit it for certain types of registrants?
326. Should we permit or require registrants to present certain disclosures in a “checkthe-box” presentation, where registrants select the appropriate disclosure from a
finite list of options? For example, should we require or permit registrants to
indicate by checkbox rather than narrative disclosure portions of the information
regarding changes in and disagreements with accountants under Item 304 or

Layered Disclosure

In first implementing our integrated disclosure system, the Commission considered
various approaches that might differentiate between institutional investors, professional security
analysts and sophisticated individual investors. 1087 These approaches included providing
investors the option of receiving a simplified annual report containing summary information in
lieu of the full, or portions of the, traditional annual report. 1088 While the Commission did not
adopt such an approach, it has encouraged layered disclosure in several instances.
The Wheat Report noted that special efforts should be made to call any unusually
speculative elements or risk factors of an offering to the attention of the ordinary investor using
an introductory statement. 1089 For MD&A, the Commission has suggested registrants use an
overview, introduction or other statement of the principal factors, trends or other matters that are
covered in more detail elsewhere in the section. 1090 The Commission cautioned that an
introduction or overview should not be a duplicative layer of disclosure that repeats the more

1087

See 1980 Form 10-K Adopting Release (“The Commission recognizes that the information content in Form 10K not only was originally formulated for a specialized use, but that within those groups which have utilized the
Form there are different constituencies. Those constituencies which have been the most frequent users of Form
10-K information are institutional investors, professional security analysts and sophisticated individual
investors.”).

1088

See id. The release noted that the potential approach would be based on an “as yet unproven hypothesis that
some users, particularly certain individual investors, either rely on financial advisers and therefore do not use
detailed disclosure, or are overwhelmed by the technical nature or volume of presently required disclosure.”
However, the release also cited studies such as that conducted by Professors Lucia S. Chang and Kenneth S.
Most at Florida International University indicating that the typical “unsophisticated small investor” often is
quite sophisticated. See Lucia S.. Chang and Kenneth S. Most, Financial Statements and Investment Decisions
(1979).

detailed discussion and analysis that follows. Instead, it should present information in a manner
that emphasizes the information and analysis that is most important.
In offering prospectuses, our rules require summary presentations where the length or
complexity of the prospectus makes a summary useful. 1091 Similarly, our rules require openend management investment companies to include key information at the front of their statutory
prospectuses in a standardized order to provide investors disclosure that is easier to use and
more readily accessible, while retaining the comprehensive quality of the information available
elsewhere. 1092

Comments Received

S-K Study. One commenter suggested that the Commission analyze each required
disclosure, segregating them by nature and frequency of change to determine the method of
filing and delivery. 1093 This commenter proposed that basic information (such as the description
of the business, risk factors, officers and directors, website address) that typically does not
significantly change from quarter to quarter, absent a specific transaction or event, should only
require updating when something changes. Additionally, the commenter recommended that the
information presented in periodic reports be limited to new information specific to the most
recent fiscal period (such as MD&A, selected quarterly financial data and executive
compensation).
Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. A few commenters addressed layering disclosure and
the use of summaries to improve disclosure. 1094 One of these commenters stated that an

integrated presentation of related information, such as layering information, with summary
information presented first and details presented later or long-standing explanatory information
that may still be relevant placed separately, perhaps as a schedule to the financial statements,
enhances understanding of the relationship between items across financial statements. 1095
Another commenter proposed a rule requiring companies to provide an overview describing what
happened at the company over the past year and the company’s expectation and concerns about
the year to come. 1096 This commenter noted that such a rule would not replace the more detailed
financial and other business information that allows analysts to populate their models and
otherwise scrutinize performance, but would permit management to identify up front what it
determines to be the most important information in a way that is both understandable and
provides context.
One commenter proposed the use of “tabs” to organize information topically (e.g.,
business, officers and directors, material risks), with information under various tabs to be
updated appropriately and supplemented with periodic MD&A disclosure. 1097 This commenter
suggested that more effective, navigable documents should eliminate the need for summary
disclosure for retail investors without eliminating material information. This commenter further
noted that all investors, retail or institutional, should have access to full and fair disclosure. 1098

Discussion

As discussed in Section III.B.2., the informational needs, financial resources, and
capacity to analyze disclosure may vary significantly among investors. Highly sophisticated

investors may seek a different level or presentation of information than those with fewer
financial or analytical resources. For example, some investors may prefer a summary
presentation while others may seek detailed data that they can analyze and compare across
companies or industries. 1099 In addition, a “layered” approach to disclosure that highlights what
management believes is the most important information, while still providing detailed data and
analysis, 1100 may make filings more navigable for all investors. On the other hand, a “layered”
approach could introduce challenges for investors or third parties seeking all available disclosure
on a particular topic, as they many need to search summary disclosures as well as more detailed
disclosures for all data and commentary relevant for their purposes. The FAST Act requires the
Commission to issue regulations permitting registrants to submit a summary page in their Form
10-K. 1101 We do not address this aspect of layered disclosure here.

Request for Comment

329. Other than a summary page, are there other approaches to layering or layered
disclosure that we should consider for business and financial information in
periodic reports? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of these approaches?

Structured Disclosures

Investors, their financial advisors, and professional analysts use increasingly complex
information and find that structured disclosures facilitate analysis of this information. 1102 Some

“layered” disclosure and, wherever possible, the use of a summary document containing key information about
an investment product or service).

See, e.g., CFA Report (stating that investors do not seek a reduction in data or volume of disclosures, as they
can use technology to evaluate the data, but instead seek to identify more effective ways to capture, manage,

investors seek structured data as it enhances their ability to use technology to process and
synthesize information, 1103 allowing for more timely and granular analysis of financial
information, including comparative 1104 and trend analysis. 1105
Structured disclosures include both numeric and narrative-based disclosures that are
made machine-readable by having reported disclosure items labeled (tagged) using a markup
language, such as eXtensible Markup Language (“XML”) 1106 or XBRL. 1107 Tagging disclosure
enables information to be structured, stored, shared, and presented in different systems or
platforms. 1108
Standardized markup languages, such as XBRL, use standard sets of data element tags
for each required reporting element, referred to as taxonomies. Taxonomies provide common
definitions that represent agreed-upon information or reporting standards, such as U.S. GAAP
analyze, present, and deliver financial data); Interactive Data Release (stating that many commenters generally
supported the required submission of interactive data).

XML is an open source markup language to tag elements of a document. It does not have a defined set of tags,
but instead provides a mechanism to define tags and structural relationships between tagged elements. See

XBRL is an open source standardized language derived from XML for purposes of tagging business reporting
information. Many commercial vendors and open source projects support the XBRL standards with tools and
software. See Stephanie Farewell, XBRL International, Inc., XBRL or Customized XML? (Oct. 2010), available

for aggregation, comparison, and large-scale statistical analysis of reported financial and other
material information through significantly more automated means than is possible with

Disclosure Effectiveness Initiative. One commenter encouraged regulators, in light of
advances in technology and connectivity and the ever-increasing demand for data, to look to
technology to facilitate the capture, management, analysis, presentation, and delivery of
information to investors. This commenter also noted that “technology holds the promise of
better (improved quantity and quality of), faster (improved timeliness of), and cheaper
(improved access to) information for investors.” 1118 Another commenter stated that the ability
to download financial tables and other data to better compare companies’ disclosures across
industries would appear to be particularly useful. 1119 This commenter also noted, however, that
the time it takes to prepare the XBRL filing may cause registrants to forego updates to its
disclosure in the days prior to filing to allow time for data tagging, and suggested that the
Commission explore technological solutions that avoid unnecessary duplication, such as
modifying XBRL or using another data tagging system that is more cost and time-efficient. 1120
One commenter supported the continued improvement of tagging and coding of financial
reporting, noting that investors and regulators alike would benefit greatly from real time access

recommendations to enhance and modernize EDGAR, including enhanced functionality

allow the user to save XBRL output more easily in Excel and identify tag extensions used by the
registrant. Another commenter provided similar recommendations to modernize EDGAR and
improve the Commission’s data tagging framework and concurred with the jointly submitted

Commission extend XBRL or other data tagging requirements to MD&A and other parts of

also recommended that the Commission consider taking steps to improve the comparability of

recommended expanding XBRL requirements, such as to earnings releases, MD&A, and proxy

One commenter encouraged the Commission to transform the current documents-based
disclosure system to a system that collects, manages, and disseminates disclosure information as
structured data with standardized tags and electronic formats. 1127 This commenter argued that
such a system would improve accountability to investors, allow public companies eventually to
reduce compliance costs by automating reporting tasks, and improve the Commission’s ability
to use data analytics to review and evaluate registrants’ submissions. As an initial step, this
commenter recommended that the Commission adopt Inline XBRL to eliminate the duplication
associated with providing the XBRL exhibit in addition to the text-based financial statements,
and to “enforce” the quality of XBRL filings. 1128 The commenter further recommended that the
Commission work with industry groups to set clearer data standards. This commenter also
suggested that the higher cost to market participants of absorbing unstructured disclosure results
in higher cost of capital to registrants, particularly smaller registrants.
2.

Discussion

The Commission requires registrants and other filers to provide certain information as
structured data to facilitate the analysis and improve the accuracy of that information. 1129 When
the Commission first adopted rules requiring reporting company registrants to provide financial
statement information in XBRL, it cited the potential of structured data to reduce the time
required for registrants to prepare their disclosures, to increase the usability of disclosures for
1127

See Data Transparency Coalition.

1128

We are considering whether to amend the current XBRL tagging requirements with respect to the financial
statements of registrants to require the use of “Inline XBRL.” Inline XBRL would allow registrants to file the
required information and data tags in one document rather than requiring a separate exhibit for the interactive
data. Commission rules and the EDGAR system do not currently allow for the use of Inline XBRL. Any such
proposal would be subject to public notice and comment as part of a separate rulemaking initiative. In this
concept release, we seek comment on the benefits and costs of structured data generally and whether it would
be appropriate to extend data tagging requirements to other Commission disclosures.

investors, and eventually to reduce costs for both registrants and investors, as structured data can
help automate regulatory filings and business information processing. 1130
By requiring structured data, the Commission has sought to make disclosure easier for
investors to access, analyze and compare across reporting periods, registrants, and industries. 1131
When registrants provide disclosure items in a standardized data format, investors can more
easily search and obtain specific information about registrants, compare common disclosures
across registrants, and observe how registrant-specific information changes across reporting
periods as the same registrant continues to file in a structured data format. 1132 Additionally, data
that investors can download, for example, from EDGAR, directly into a spreadsheet or statistical
analysis software eliminates the need to enter the information manually, which minimizes the
time burden and risk of errors associated with data entry.
In adopting Regulation AB requiring asset-level disclosures in XML, the Commission
noted that requiring this information in a standardized machine-readable format makes the data
transparent and comparable. 1133 The Commission stated that it expected that this would lower
the cost for investors of accessing, collecting and analyzing information, which would lead to
better allocation of capital. In requiring the information in XML rather than XBRL, the

1130

See Interactive Data Release (noting that interactive data, unlike static, text-based information, (1) can be
dynamically searched and analyzed, facilitating the comparison of financial and business performance across
companies, reporting periods, and industries, and (2) allows for the automation of regulatory filings and
business information processing, with the potential to increase the speed, accuracy, and usability of financial
disclosure and eventually to reduce costs); Interactive Data for Mutual Funds Release (stating the Commission’s
intent not only to make risk/return summary information easier for investors to analyze but also to assist in
automating regulatory filings and business information processing).

Commission noted that the relatively simpler data to be presented in these disclosures, in contrast
to the rich complexity of corporate financial disclosures, was well-suited for XML. 1134
Our rules requiring registrants to file financial and other information in a structured
format require that data to be filed as an exhibit to the filing rather than embedded in the filing
itself. 1135 In this way, the structured data supplements but does not replace the traditional HTML
electronic filing format. Having XBRL and other structured data submitted as a separate exhibit,
however, has raised a number of issues regarding the accuracy and usability of the data.
First, structured data filed as a separate exhibit does not look like the disclosure in the
related HTML document submitted by the registrant unless specially rendered to do so with
specialized software. 1136 In an effort to make the XBRL data look more like the HTML
document, some registrants create custom elements or dimensions or otherwise alter their XBRL
documents. While our rules permit custom or company-specific element extensions for
disclosures for which the standard U.S. GAAP taxonomy does not provide an appropriate
element, the Commission and its staff have cautioned against custom elements for minor
differences 1137 or solely for formatting, 1138 which can inhibit automated parsing processes and
potentially create confusion between U.S. GAAP and company specific extension elements. The

staff also has found that many registrants create custom axis extensions despite the availability of
appropriate standard axis elements in the standard U.S. GAAP taxonomy, further diminishing
data quality and impairing comparability across registrants and filings. 1139 These and other
potentially inappropriate uses of custom elements identified by Commission staff can affect the
quality of the data and its potential use. 1140
Second, the redundant process of preparing financial statements and periodic reports in
HTML or ASCII and then preparing exhibits in XBRL creates a greater chance of data entry and
other errors. Staff identified a number of errors, such as characterization of a number as negative
when it is positive, missing amounts and calculations, and other inaccuracies, 1141 which may
occur more frequently, partially as a result of these redundant processes. Registrants often
outsource the structuring of their XBRL reports, thereby adding incremental manual processes

at http://www.sec.gov/dera/reportspubs/assessment-custom-tag-rates-xbrl.html (in which, for a random sample
of filings that staff reviewed, staff observed instances of filers creating custom axis tags unnecessarily when an
appropriate standard axis tag existed in the U.S. GAAP taxonomy).
An axis tag allows a filer to divide reported elements into different dimensions (e.g., revenue by geographical
area, fair value measurement levels, components of total equity (e.g., common, preferred)). In a recent
assessment of custom axis extensions use in XBRL exhibits, DERA staff reported that despite the overall
decline in the use of custom tags generally, approximately 50% of filers continue to create custom axis tags,
with large accelerated filers using custom axis tags more than twice as often as SRCs. DERA staff suggested
that a contributing factor may be that SRCs likely have less complex financial disclosures that can be structured
primarily using axis options provided by the U.S. GAAP taxonomy. See 2016 Staff Observations.
In a previous review of the use of custom tags in general in XBRL exhibits, the staff found a steady decline in
custom element use by larger registrants, indicating improvements in the U.S. GAAP taxonomy and registrants’
selections of tags. However, in contrast to the recent findings on axis extensions, the staff found that smaller
filers were associated with an average custom tag rate almost 50% greater than that of larger filers. Staff
analysis also revealed that some of the perceived quality issues associated with XBRL data are correlated with
particular third-party providers of XBRL software and services, which may be, at least in part, due to continued
innovation and growth in the market for filer software and services, resulting in offerings of varying
functionality and ease of use. See id; 2014 Staff Observations.

and controls to their efforts, which in turn can adversely affect the quality of XBRL-formatted
disclosures. 1142 Observers also have noted that XBRL data is not required to be audited,
resulting in diminished investor confidence in the quality of the data. 1143
We continue to explore ways to incorporate structured data. We also continue to explore
changes to the Commission’s website and the EDGAR system that could enhance the usefulness
of structured disclosures. For example, in December 2014, the Commission announced a pilot
program under which data that registrants provide in structured formats would be combined and
organized into structured data sets and posted for bulk downloads on the Commission’s website
for use by investors and academics. 1144
Concerns have been raised about the costs and time burden associated with structured
data requirements. For example, the ACSEC has focused on the costs of structuring disclosures
and asserted that the requirements impose a disproportionate burden on smaller registrants in
terms of cost and time. 1145 As discussed above, both ACSEC and the Small Business Forum
have recommended that the Commission exempt SRCs from the requirement to provide financial
information in XBRL. 1146 In its own structured data recommendation, the Investor Advisory
Committee generally supported structured data but acknowledged the costs of data tagging and

recommended that the Commission take steps to reduce these costs, particularly for smaller
registrants and investors. 1147 According to a 2015 AICPA study, however, XBRL filing costs for
smaller registrants were lower than initially expected and have been decreasing since the 2009
inception of the Commission’s Structured Data Program. 1148
We acknowledge that registrants may incur costs to provide disclosure in structured data
format, particularly initial set-up costs. We seek public comment on ways to minimize the costs
of providing structured disclosures, particularly over time, while still realizing the intended
benefits to investors and other users of such disclosures.

Request for Comment

330. How can the quality of structured disclosures be enhanced?
331. Are there changes to the EDGAR system that the Commission should make to
render the structured disclosure filed by registrants more useful?
332. Are company-specific custom extensions, such as element or axis extensions, useful
to investors or other users of structured disclosures? If so, how might these custom
extensions be made more useful for enhancing automated analysis? If not, are there
better ways to express disclosures that are unique to a company (e.g., business
segment, product line)?
333. Should we require registrants to provide additional disclosures in a structured
format? If so, which disclosures? For example, are there categories of information

in Parts I and II of Form 10-K or in Form 10-Q that investors would want to receive
as structured data?
334. To the extent that we consider additional structured data requirements for disclosure
in periodic reports, what level of structured data requirements would be
appropriate? For example, should we require registrants to identify sections, subsections or topics with “block text” labels, or should we require registrants to
structure numeric elements and tables individually? What would be the challenges
and costs of such an approach? What would be the benefit?
335. How does the availability of structured data in registrants’ periodic reports affect
the timeliness, efficiency, or depth of investors’ review of disclosures? How do the
effects of structured disclosure requirements vary across investor types? Are there
other methods of structuring disclosures that would make disclosures more
accessible or useful?
336. To what extent is the information currently provided in structured disclosures
readily available through other sources, such as third-party data aggregators? What
are the costs and benefits to investors of obtaining this data from such third parties
rather than through the use of structured disclosures filed by registrants?
337. To what extent do investors, analysts, third-party data aggregators, or other market
participants rely on structured data provided by registrants in their periodic reports?
What specific content in structured disclosures is useful to each of these groups?
338. Are there other ways in which our requirements can improve the accuracy of tagged
data? What would be the challenges to registrants posed by such alternatives?

339

339. Are there certain categories of registrant for which we should provide an exemption
from some or all structured disclosure requirements, require more limited
information to be tagged, or require a different presentation of this information?
Why or why not? If so, to which registrants or structured disclosure requirements
should such exemptions apply?
340. In requiring structured data, the Commission has sought to make disclosure easier
for investors to access, analyze and compare across reporting periods, registrants,
and industries. 1149 Are there other technologies that could make disclosure easier
for investors to access, analyze and compare? If so, how should we incorporate
these technologies into our disclosure requirements?
