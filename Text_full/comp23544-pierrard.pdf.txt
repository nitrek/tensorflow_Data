IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA
CHARLOTTE DIVISION

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,

Civil Action No.

v.
JOHN PIERRARD,
Defendant.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission("Commission"), files its
complaint and alleges that:
OVERVIEW
1.

This matter involves a financial fraud conducted by the accounting

department of Swisher Hygiene, Inc.("Swisher")that began shortly after the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based hygiene and sanitation company became a public
reporting company in late 2010. During 2011, Swisher was engaged in ongoing
acquisitions of related sanitation and waste management companies, and lacked
effective internal controls over financial reporting.
2.

Exploiting Swisher's lack of effective internal controls, Swisher's

accounting group reevaluated and manipulated various acquisition-related reserves

Case 3:16-cv-00257 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 1 of 19

and expenses in order to increase earnings to predetermined targets tied to what
Swisher management understood to be the expectations of the Company's lenders
as the basis for future acquisition financing.
3.

John Pierrard("Pierrard"), the company's Director of Financial Planning

and Analysis, assisted in carrying out this scheme.
4.

The scheme came to light in early 2012, before Swisher filed its Form 10-K

for 2011. Specifically, a former employee provided Swisher's general counsel and
outside auditor, BDO USA,LLP("BDO"), with a draft letter outlining the
employee's concerns that the accounting department was preparing financial
statements manipulated to meet previously communicated targets.
5.

Upon learning of the former employee's allegations, Swisher's Audit

Committee commenced an internal investigation, which led to the terminations of
several individuals, including Pierrard.
6.

In February 2013, after the conclusion of the internal investigation, Swisher

filed amended quarterly reports for the first three quarters of 2011, including
restated financial statements, to reflect adjustments to previously reported financial
information. The restatement reflects the reversal of entries made in furtherance of
the earnings management scheme.

2

Case 3:16-cv-00257 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 2 of 19

7.

As restated, Swisher's aggregate reported losses for the first three quarters of

2011 increased by a total of approximately $4.8 million.
8.

During the closing process for fourth quarter of 2011, Pierrard, at the

direction of Swisher's CFO, manipulated Swisher's allowance for doubtful account
to increase earnings, knowing or consciously disregarding that the associated
entries were not in accordance with GAAP.

THE DEFENDANT
15.

John Pierrard is a resident of Delray Beach, Florida. Pierrard became an

employee of Swisher in early 2011. During the relevant period, Pierrard was
Swisher's Director of Financial Planning and Analysis, and he reported to
Swisher's CFO. Swisher terminated Pierrard in May 2012.
16.

Pierrard has pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities

fraud in connection with his employment at Swisher. United States v. Pierrard
Case No. 3:15-CR-238(W.DN.C.)
OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY
17.

In 2001 and 2012, Swisher Hygiene, Inc. was a Delaware corporation

headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Prior to the sale of its operating assets,
Swisher was a commercial hygiene company delivering essential hygiene and
sanitizing solutions to customers in a wide range of end-markets. Swisher's
common stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
Swisher became a public company at the end of 2010, and its stock commenced
trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC("NASDAQ")on February 2, 2011.
5

Case 3:16-cv-00257 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 5 of 19

In November 2015, Swisher consummated the sale of the stock of its wholly
owned U.S. subsidiary, Swisher International, Inc., and other assets relating to
Swisher's U.S. operations, which comprised all of Swisher's remaining operating
interests, to Ecolab, Inc., a publically traded company. In January 2016, NASDAQ
suspended trading in Swisher's stock, and initiated formal delisting proceedings.
THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
18.

Swisher's financial statement closing process during the second, third, and

fourth quarters of 2011 was conducted with the intent to realize targeted Adjusted
EBITDA figures, and the closing process ended immediately after achieving those
results rather than continuing through a complete analysis of all significant
accounts.
19.

EBITDA generally stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation

and amortization. In its September 30, 2011 Form 10-Q, Swisher defined
Adjusted EBITDA as "net loss excluding the impact ofincome taxes, depreciation
and amortization expense, interest expense and income, foreign currency gain, net
gain loss on debt related fair value measurements, stock based compensation and
third party costs directly related to merger s and acquisitions."
20.

Swisher's closing process followed a consistent pattern, namely: (1)the

communication by the CFO of an Adjusted EBITDA target to accounting
D

Case 3:16-cv-00257 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 6 of 19

personnel;(2) an initial closing process that produced numbers less than the target;
(3) meetings and communications through which the CFO demanded adjustments
to help Swisher meet the original target;(4)the recording of inappropriate
accounting entries to achieve the target; and (5)the immediate cessation of the
closing process once the target was achieved.
21.

After reaching the Adjusted EBITDA target, the CFO typically would advise

his team that additional entries would not be recorded.
22.

Pierrrad, as a member of the accounting department, was aware of and

participated in this improper closing process.
23.

Moreover, Pierrad actively assisted in manipulating at least one account to

reach EBITDA targets.
24.

During the fourth quarter of 201 1, accounting personnel discovered that

Swisher had significantly understated it reserve for doubtful accounts because the
company had failed to include write-offs associated with one ofthe companies it
had acquired in 2011. The CFO instructed Pierrard to come up with a solution that
would increase the reserve without impacting Swisher's earnings.
25.

In response, Pierrard obtained a spreadsheet of Swisher's acquisitions during

the year, and arbitrarily increased the previously recorded reserves for each
company by approximately 5%,thereby increasing the reserve for doubtful
7

Case 3:16-cv-00257 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 7 of 19

accounts by approximately $550,000. There was no legitimate justification to
increase the reserves in this manner.
26.

This improper adjustment allowed Swisher to increase its reserve for

doubtful accounts without impacting earnings.
27.

Pierrard prepared this adjustment and caused it to be entered into Swisher's

accounting books and records even though he had concerns with its effect on
earnings and despite the fact that he believed he was underqualified to perform the
analysis.
28.

By preparing this adjustment and causing it to be entered into the accounting

books and records, Pierrad caused Swisher's accounting books and records to not
be in conformity with GAAP.
29.

Pierrard knowingly circumvented Swisher's internal accounting controls to

manipulate the allowance for doubtful accounts.
DISCOVERY OF THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
30.

Swisher's earnings management scheme unraveled in early 2012.

31.

During the closing process for the fourth quarter of 2011, the CFO

terminated a member of the accounting department. That former employee
subsequently met with Swisher's General Counsel and BDO and provided them
with a draft letter to the audit committee. The letter raised several accounting

Case 3:16-cv-00257 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 8 of 19

issues, including the allegation that Swisher was using purchase accounting to
manage reported results to previously determined Adjusted EBITDA targets.
32.

The former employee's letter also alleged that Swisher's standard practice

was to put reserves on the opening balance sheet for a number of potential losses
and for contingent consideration. According to the letter, the reserves were
typically recorded at their highest possible amount so that they could be considered
part ofthe purchase price of the acquired entity and thus offset against goodwill.
Swisher would later reduce the inflated reserves and reflect the reduction as an
increase to income.
33.

The letter further alleged that rather than expensing the costs that arose in

connection with the ongoing operation of the acquired businesses, Swisher would
frequently place those costs on the opening balance sheet as part of goodwill.
34.

After learning of the former employee's allegations, in March 2012

Swisher's audit committee hired the law firm of Holland &Knight to conduct an
internal investigation. Holland &Knight and the forensic accounting firm Cherry
Beckert &Holland reviewed the accounting entries related to each of the 63
acquisitions made by Swisher in 2011.
35.

On May 17, 2012, Swisher announced that it was firing several individuals,

including Pierrard.
E

Case 3:16-cv-00257 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 9 of 19

36.

On March 28, 2012, Swisher announced that its quarterly reports for 2011

should no longer be relied upon and might require restatement.
37.

Although the fraudulent earnings management scheme continued into the

fourth quarter of 2011, the scheme was discovered and came to a halt before the
filing of the 2011 Form 10-K. Thus, although the fraudulent accounting entries
were recorded in Swisher's books and records for the fourth quarter, none of the
fraudulent accounting for that quarter is reflected in filings with the Commission.
38.

As a result of Swisher's earnings management and departure from GAAP,

the internal investigators identified approximately 20 accounts that were materially
misstated in 2011. Consequently, on February 19, 20 and 21, 2013, Swisher filed
amended quarterly reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly periods ended March
31, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011, respectively.
