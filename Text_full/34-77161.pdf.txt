ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

In the Matter of
DONALD J. GLIDEWELL,
CPA
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Donald J. Glidewell (“the Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, the Respondent has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”), that the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and over the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and the Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
This matter involves misstated revenues at Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. (“MBI”
or “the Company”), a Davis, California-based company that manufactures and sells biologicalbased pest management and plant health products. The misstatements were the result of MBI’s
former Chief Operating Officer and Head of Sales directing MBI’s sales employees to offer
various sales concessions to MBI’s distributors in order to meet sales targets and analysts’ revenue
expectations, while simultaneously concealing those concessions from MBI’s finance and
accounting personnel. Accordingly, MBI improperly and prematurely recognized more than $4
million in revenue from March 2013 through June 2014 (the “relevant period”), including $2
million in revenue that will never be recognized because the distributors returned the product to
MBI.
2.
As a result, MBI reported materially false financial results in its financial
statements filed with the Commission over the period from July 1, 2013 through May 15, 2014.
On September 3, 2014, MBI announced that its previously filed financial statements could not be
relied upon. On November 10, 2015, MBI filed with the Commission restated financial statements
for its 2013 quarterly and annual periods, as well as the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014
and June 30, 2014.
3.
MBI’s former Chief Financial Officer, Donald J. Glidewell, received bonuses
during the 12-month periods following the filings containing financial results that MBI has restated
as a result of misconduct. The Commission does not allege that Glidewell participated in the
misconduct giving rise to the restatement. Glidewell has not, however, reimbursed MBI for those
bonuses as required under Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Respondent
4.
Donald J. Glidewell, age 59, is a resident of Benicia, California. He served as
MBI’s Chief Financial Officer from April 2011 until his resignation in March 2014. Glidewell is a
certified public accountant licensed in California. Before joining MBI, Glidewell served as the
CFO at a private company in the Sacramento area from 2000 to 2007 and as a Senior Director of
Finance at the U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese-based public company from 2007 to 2011.

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and
is not binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

Other Relevant Entity
5.
MBI is a public company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Davis,
California. At all relevant times, MBI’s common stock has been registered under Section 12(b) of
the Exchange Act. MBI had its initial public offering (“IPO”), in August 2013, after which its
stock traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “MBII”. On June 6, 2014, MBI
undertook both a secondary and a follow-on offering in which it netted $39.9 million. On
November 10, 2015, MBI restated its financial statements for its year ended December 31, 2013, as
well as its quarterly results for the periods ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30,
2013, March 31, 2014, and June 30, 2014.
Facts
MBI Conducts an Initial Public Offering and Issues Revenue Guidance
6.
On September 12, 2013, MBI held its first quarterly earnings call where it
announced that revenues for the first six months of 2013 totaled $7.2 million and that MBI
expected revenues for 2013 to double those of 2012 (which were $7.1 million). After that, MBI’s
senior leaders consistently urged MBI’s employees to ensure the Company met its goal; the
doubling of revenue became a key financial metric for MBI’s leadership. Analysts covering MBI
cared about the Company’s expected sales and sales growth and the doubling of revenue was the
only guidance that MBI’s management provided to analysts.
7.
MBI primarily sold its products to distributors who would then sell the product to
growers and other end users. MBI historically recognized revenue on a “sell-in” basis, which
meant that it recognized revenue upon sale to a distributor rather than waiting to recognize revenue
until products were sold to the ultimate grower or end user. This was appropriate under MBI’s
revenue recognition policy as long as persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, delivery and
transfer of title had occurred or services had been rendered, the price was fixed and determinable,
and collectability was reasonably assured and no contingencies existed. MBI’s revenue
recognition policy did not allow for recognition of revenue at the time of sale if any
contingencies—such as rights of return, or extended payment terms—were offered; rather, revenue
could be recognized only once the contingencies expired.
MBI Sales Employees Offer, And Hide From MBI’s Accounting Department, Numerous
Sales Concessions to Meet Previously-Announced Revenue Targets
8.
Towards the end of 2013, MBI’s former Chief Operating Officer became concerned
that MBI might not meet its goal of doubling its 2012 revenue because its distributors did not have
any more capacity to buy MBI’s products. To close the gap, MBI’s former COO—then Head of
Sales—instructed his sales employees to offer inventory protection on deals to ensure they moved
as much product as they could by the end of the year. The inventory protection offered took three
general forms: (1) rights to return unsold product; (2) credit and re-bill arrangements, which
3

extended payment dates beyond the originally agreed-upon terms; and (3) allowing payment for
products upon sales to the end user, rather than pursuant to stated payment terms with the
distributor.
9.
In addition to offering inventory protection on certain deals in the first and second
quarters of MBI’s 2013 fiscal year, the former COO and other MBI sales employees offered
significantly more inventory protection towards the end of the year. During the relevant period,
MBI’s former COO offered, and directed others to offer, inventory protection on at least eleven
sales transactions totaling approximately $4 million.
10.
MBI’s former COO knew that inventory protection could preclude immediate
revenue recognition on deals sold through to distributors and that MBI’s accounting department
needed to know the terms of all sales transactions to ensure MBI’s revenue was accurately
recorded and reported. Respondent Glidewell, MBI’s chief executive officer, and MBI’s controller
told the former COO on multiple occasions throughout 2013 and 2014 about the revenue
implications of offering inventory protection.
11.
Despite knowing that it was important for MBI’s accounting department to be
aware of all terms and conditions of each sales transaction, MBI’s former COO instructed MBI’s
employees to conceal the inventory protection terms from MBI’s accountants. For example, in late
2013, he instructed MBI’s former Customer Service Manager to hide a side letter in her office
desk, which detailed inventory protection on a large sales transaction transacted late in the fourth
quarter of 2013. He also instructed the former Customer Service Manager to physically remove
the inventory protection terms from the face of a purchase order on another sales transaction.
These actions caused MBI to file financial statements that were not in accordance with GAAP. See
Accounting Standards Codification 605-15-25-1.
12.
Additionally, despite knowing he personally had offered, and authorized his sales
employees to offer, inventory protection on several sales transactions in 2013 and 2014, MBI’s
former COO consistently denied knowing about transactions with inventory protection in several
quarterly and annual disclosure committee meetings, the purpose of which was to help MBI’s
accounting department ensure that MBI appropriately recorded and reported its revenue. MBI’s
former COO also lied on a sales certification provided to him by MBI’s independent auditor in
connection with their year-end 2013 audit by certifying in writing that he was not aware of any
terms or conditions MBI had agreed to with distributors that were not reflected in written
agreements or purchase orders.
13.
On March 6, 2014, MBI held its 2013 full-year earnings call. During the call,
MBI’s former COO attributed the Company’s achievement of doubling its 2012 revenue to the
successful launch of a new product into row crops in the Midwest and the stellar performance of
another product in its first full year of sales.
14.
On March 25, 2014, MBI filed its 2013 Form 10-K with the Commission.
Revenue, as reported, more than doubled from $7.1 million in 2012 to $14.5 million in 2013.
4

15.
MBI’s former COO, as well as several of his sales employees, continued to offer
inventory protection throughout at least the first quarter of 2014 and continued to hide it from
MBI’s accounting department. All told, MBI’s former COO caused MBI to improperly recognize
revenue on at least eleven sales transactions totaling approximately $4 million. Without offering
inventory protection on these sales transactions, MBI would have missed its doubling-of-revenue
target for 2013 because many of the Company’s distributors would not have purchased its products
without assurances that they could return them in the future.
16.
MBI’s former COO also engaged in other fraudulent conduct to maximize revenue
and allow MBI to recognize revenue earlier than allowed under GAAP. During 2013, the former
COO instructed employees in MBI’s supply chain department to ship the wrong product to a
distributor and in early 2014, the former COO directed MBI’s former Customer Relations Manager
to backdate a shipping document. In an additional attempt to book certain sales transactions, the
former COO authorized MBI to pay a distributor’s freight costs and storage fees, and then directed
the former Customer Relations Manager to mischaracterize these expenses as promotional
marketing expenses in the Company’s books and records, resulting in MBI filing financial
statements that were not in accordance with GAAP. See Accounting Standards Codification 60550-45-2.
Scope and Impact of the Fraud at MBI
17.
MBI’s revenues were materially overstated in its financial statements filed with the
Commission as a result of the hidden inventory protection. Specifically, MBI misstated its
financial statements in Forms 10-Q and 10-K for fiscal year 2013 and Forms 10-Q for 2014. MBI
also misstated its financial statements in the Company’s Forms S-1 filed on July 1, 2013 and May
16, 2014. Finally, MBI incorporated the misstated first quarter 2013 financial statements, as
included in the first Form S-1, in its Form S-8 filed on September 6, 2013.
18.
These misstatements are material. Without the inventory protection on several
sales transactions in 2013, MBI would not have doubled its 2012 revenue and would have missed
its revenue target for the year. MBI’s distributors returned approximately $2 million in product
after June 30, 2014 pursuant to inventory protection rights and the Company will not recognize this
revenue in any future period.
MBI’s Restatement
19.
On September 3, 2014, MBI announced that its Audit Committee had commenced
an independent investigation into whether revenue for a particular transaction had been
appropriately recognized. It also announced that it had concluded, after consultation with
management, that its previously reported financial statements as of December 31, 2013, included
in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and the unaudited
interim financial statements included in the Company’s quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the
quarters ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, should no longer be relied upon.
5

20.
On November 10, 2015, MBI filed with the Commission restated financial results,
for its quarterly periods ending March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013, September 30, 2013, March 31,
2014, and June 30, 2014, as well as its annual results for the year ended December 31, 2013. For
certain distributors, MBI changed its method of recognizing revenue from “sell-in” to “sellthrough,” meaning that, for those distributors, it will delay the recognition of revenue until the
product is sold through to an end user.
21.
In its restated Form 10-K, MBI disclosed that its Audit Committee had determined
that, as a result of the failure of certain former employees to share with the Company’s accounting
department or external auditor important transaction terms with distributors, including inventory
protection agreements that would permit the distributors to return to the Company certain unsold
products, the Company inappropriately recognized revenue for certain historical sales transactions
prior to satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition required under GAAP. MBI also concluded
that mitigating controls were not in place to discourage, prevent or detect management override of
internal accounting control by certain sales personnel related to MBI’s process for recognizing
revenue, and that its controls were not effectively designed to identify instances when sales
personnel made unauthorized commitments with certain distributors, including inventory
protection arrangements, that would permit the distributors to return to MBI certain unsold
products.
Compensation of CFO Glidewell
22.
During the 12-month periods that followed the filing of the periodic reports
requiring restatement, Glidewell received bonuses that were tied to MBI’s achievement of certain
revenue targets.
23.

Glidewell has not reimbursed those amounts to MBI.
Violations

24.
Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the chief executive officer
or chief financial officer of any issuer required to prepare an accounting restatement due to
material noncompliance with the securities laws as a result of misconduct to reimburse the issuer
for: (i) any bonus or incentive-based or equity-based compensation received by that person from
the issuer during the 12-month periods following the false filings; and (ii) any profits realized from
the sale of securities of the issuer during that 12-month periods. Section 304 does not require that a
chief executive officer or chief financial officer engage in misconduct to trigger the reimbursement
requirement. Glidewell received bonuses during the 12-month periods following the filings
containing financial results that MBI was required to restate. He has not, to date, reimbursed the
Company for those amounts. Glidewell has, therefore, violated Sarbanes-Oxley Section 304.

6

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, that:
A.
Respondent Glidewell cease and desist from committing or causing any violations
and any future violations of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
B.
Respondent Glidewell shall, within 30 days of the entry of this Order, reimburse
MBI for a total of $11,789 pursuant to Section 304(a) of SOX. Respondent shall simultaneously
deliver proof of satisfying this reimbursement obligation to Erin E. Schneider, Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 44 Montgomery Street, Suite 2800, San
Francisco, California 94104.

By the Commission.
