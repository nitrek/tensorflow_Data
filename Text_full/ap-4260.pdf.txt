ORDER FOLLOWING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE AND TO SHOW CAUSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on September 23, 2016. On
October 5, 2016, I postponed the hearing, ordered a prehearing conference for October 13, 2016,
and directed the Division of Enforcement to file a declaration of service. Medient Studios, Inc.,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4226, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3784.
The Division filed a declaration of service on October 12, 2016. I held a prehearing
conference on October 13, 2016, at which only the Division appeared. The Division reported
that it has not been contacted by Respondent. During the prehearing conference, I found that
Respondent was served with the OIP on September 29, 2016, and its answer was due by October
12, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.141(a)(2)(ii), .160(b), .220(b).
As of this date, Respondent has not participated in the proceeding. Accordingly, I
ORDER Respondent to SHOW CAUSE by October 27, 2016, why the registration of its
securities should not be revoked by default for its failure to timely file an answer, participate in
the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend the proceeding. Failure to respond to this order
will result in the revocation of Respondent’s registered securities. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
