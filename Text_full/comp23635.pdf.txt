AMENDED COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) alleges as follows:
NATURE OF ACTION
1.

The SEC brings this action to halt an ongoing fraudulent and unregistered

securities offering being perpetrated by Defendants Providence Financial Investments, Inc.
(“Providence Financial”) and Providence Fixed Income Fund, LLC (“Providence Fund”).
Since at least as early as 2011, Providence Financial and Providence Fund have raised
more than $64 million from over 400 investors throughout the United States.
2.

The securities at issue are promissory notes that purport to pay annual

returns generally ranging from 12% to 13%. Providence Financial and Providence Fund
represented to investors that their investment proceeds would be used to fund the
“factoring” of accounts receivable in Brazil. Contrary to these representations,

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 2 of 26

Providence Financial and Providence Fund spent, at best, less than 68% of their
investors’ money to finance Brazil factoring transactions, and both companies have been
unable to account for how they spent the remaining investor proceeds. One use of
investor funds that was not disclosed to investors was the generous 6% annual
commission that Providence Financial and Providence Fund paid to their unregistered
brokers for selling the promissory notes. Another undisclosed use of funds was the
payment of millions of dollars to Providence Financial and Providence Fund insiders.
3.

In addition to misrepresenting how they would use investor funds,

Providence Financial and Providence Fund have concealed from investors that the
companies face serious financial difficulties. Providence Financial and Providence Fund
hold very little cash or liquid assets, and the amount of money owed to investors vastly
exceeds the value of any Brazilian receivables investments held by Providence Financial
and Providence Fund. Compounding these problems is a highly unfavorable foreign
exchange rate which hinders the repatriation of Brazilian assets to repay U.S investors.
As a result, the only way Providence Financial and Providence Fund are repaying their
current investors is through the proceeds of new investments.
4.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund have failed to disclose any of

this negative financial information to their investors. Instead, Providence Financial and
Providence Fund tout the notes as a safe and relatively low risk investment.
5.

To lure investors, Providence Financial and Providence Fund employ a

team of unregistered brokers throughout the United States, and pay them the
aforementioned 6% annual commission for each successful promissory note sale. One
2

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 3 of 26

such unregistered broker is Defendant Jeffory Churchfield, a Forest Lake financial
advisor who promoted the promissory notes to his Minnesota clients. Another is
Defendant Jack Jarrell, an investment adviser registered with the State of Washington,
who assisted Churchfield in promoting the promissory notes to his Minnesota clients.
6.

In the course of the SEC’s investigation, Providence Financial and

Providence Fund have been unable to answer basic questions about their organizational
structure, their use of investor proceeds, and their current financial condition. These
defendants have failed to produce audited or consolidated financial statements, up-to-date
financial information, or a current inventory of their purported factoring investments.
7.

When the SEC sought to learn more information on these subjects by

compelling the testimony of Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s CEO,
Anthony Buzaneli, he asserted his 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
8.

Buzaneli controlled all aspects of the day-to-day operations of Providence

Financial and Providence Fund until those entities filed for bankruptcy.
9.

While the SEC continues to investigate the promissory note offerings, it

brings this action now to stop the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered securities
through unregistered brokers. In addition to seeking temporary and preliminary relief to
halt the ongoing offering and preserve investor funds, including the appointment of a
receiver, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against the defendants to enjoin them
from future violations of the federal securities laws specified below. The SEC further
seeks an order requiring the defendants to pay civil penalties and disgorgement, plus
prejudgment interest, on all ill-gotten gains they received.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
I.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund Offer and Sell Unregistered
Securities through Unregistered Brokers.
19.

From at least as early as 2011, Providence Financial and Providence Fund

have been issuing, offering to sell, and selling fixed rate promissory notes to investors in
the United States and elsewhere.
20.

Generally, the notes pay annual interest rates of 12% to 13%. Investors

generally have the option of purchasing a note with a one-year term at or slightly less
than 12%, or purchasing a note with a longer term at a higher interest rate. Providence
Financial and Providence Fund allow investors to elect to receive monthly or quarterly
cash interest payments or take a one-time payment of interest, at a higher rate, upon
maturity.

6

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 7 of 26

21.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund purport to use the proceeds of

those notes to generate profits via investment in receivables transactions –a practice they
refer to as “factoring” – made through certain affiliated companies in Brazil. At least 400
U.S. investors currently hold at least $64 million in notes issued by Providence Financial
and Providence Fund.
22.

The notes issued by Providence Financial and Providence Fund are

securities, as that term is defined in the federal securities laws.
23.

No registration statement has been filed with the SEC concerning the notes

sold by Providence Financial or Providence Fund to investors in the United States.
24.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund have offered and sold the

unregistered notes through a network of unregistered brokers, including Defendants
Churchfield and Jarrell.
25.

Churchfield, Jarrell, and other unregistered brokers have offered and sold

Providence Financial and Providence Fund notes pursuant to agreements with a related
Providence Group company that pay the brokers an annual commission in the amount of
6% of the face value of each note sold.
26.

Jarrell began selling the promissory notes in March 2012, and has offered

and sold the notes to investors with whom Jarrell had an investment advisory agreement
in place.
27.

In 2015, Providence Financial and Providence Fund paid Jarrell

approximately $260,000 in commissions on the sale of the promissory notes. In addition,
Providence Financial and Providence Fund have paid for half of Jarrell’s office rent since
7

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 8 of 26

Jarrell began selling the promissory notes to his clients. Jarrell did not disclose this
compensation to any of the investors to whom he sold Providence notes, including the
individuals with whom he had advisory agreements in place.
28.

Churchfield began offering and selling Providence Fund and Providence

Financial promissory notes in 2013. At Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s
direction, Jarrell provided guidance, training, and assistance to Churchfield on how to
offer and sell the promissory notes. In addition to the 6% commission paid to
Churchfield, Providence Fund and Providence Financial paid Jarrell a 3% annual
“override” commission on the face value of notes sold by Churchfield. Accordingly, 9%
of the proceeds of the investments sold by Churchfield would be devoted, annually, to
commissions for Churchfield and Jarrell.
29.

In 2015, Providence Financial and Providence Fund paid Churchfield

approximately $130,000 in commissions on the sale of the promissory notes, which
represented Churchfield’s sole source of income for that year. In addition, Providence
Financial and Providence Fund have paid for all of Churchfield’s office rent since he
began offering the promissory notes.
30.

Jarrell and Churchfield identified potential investors for the promissory

notes by, among other things, holding “social security seminars.” In the course of selling
notes to investors, both Jarrell and Churchfield explained the investment to potential
investors using documents provided to them by Providence Financial and Providence
Fund. They met with and answered questions from investors and potential investors,
accepted application materials, forwarded signed applications and promissory notes to
8

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 9 of 26

Providence Financial and Providence Fund, and transferred investor funds to and from
Providence Financial and Providence Fund.
31.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund offered higher interest rates to

noteholders that did not take monthly or quarterly interest payments in cash, but instead
allowed interest to accrue until their notes matured. The majority of investors chose not
to take monthly or quarterly cash interest payments, but instead opted to allow interest to
accrue until the notes reached maturity.
32.

When their notes matured, many investors did not take repayment of their

principal and payment of accrued interest in cash. Instead, they “renewed” their notes by
transferring the principal and any accrued interest on their mature notes into new notes.
Both Jarrell and Churchfield walked their clients through the note renewal process,
collecting client signatures on new notes and other documents and forwarding those
documents to Providence Financial and Providence Fund.
33.

At some point in 2015, Providence Financial and Providence Fund began

sending Jarrell and other unregistered brokers an “Accredited Applicant Questionnaire”
along with other documents used in the note renewal process. However, Jarrell never
used this questionnaire with his clients. Moreover, numerous promissory note investors
were not “accredited” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws.
II.

The Promissory Note Offering Materials Contain Material
Misrepresentations and Omissions.
34.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund gave investors only a limited

amount of information about the notes or their purported factoring business in Brazil.

9

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 10 of 26

That information initially took the form of a Providence Fund “Executive Memorandum,”
which Providence Fund and Providence Financial provided to investors and the
unregistered brokers who promoted the promissory notes.
35.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund later provided investors and

brokers a document entitled “Providence Financial Investments Inc. High Yield Fixed
Returns Information” (the “Information Memorandum”).
36.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund additionally promoted, and

continue to promote, the promissory notes on a public website: www.provfinance.com.
37.

Neither the Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum, the

website, nor any of the other materials that Providence Financial and Providence Fund
provided to investors included financial statements or balance sheets related to
Providence Financial, Providence Fund, or any of their affiliates. Indeed, when requested
by Churchfield to provide such information, Providence Financial and Providence Fund
refused, telling Churchfield: “we are not a public company and don’t disclose this.”
38.

The Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum, and the website

provide a general description, and tout the profitability, of the receivables financing
business that Providence Financial and Providence Fund purport to conduct in the
Brazilian factoring market. These offering materials describe factoring as a financial
transaction whereby a business sells its accounts receivable to a third party (the factor) at
a discount, and the factor obtains the rights associated with the receivables. In theory, the
factor makes money via the spread between the discounted purchase price of the

10

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 11 of 26

receivables and the supposedly larger amount the factor collects when the outstanding
receivables are paid off.
39.

The Executive Memorandum describes the promissory notes, and states that

Providence Fund will pay noteholders 12% annual interest, with payments to be made
monthly. The Executive Memorandum indicates that note proceeds will be used, solely,
to finance receivables factoring in Brazil. The Executive Memorandum additionally
describes the promissory notes as a “low to moderate risk” investment.
40.

Similar to the Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum

contains a general discussion of receivables financing and factoring in Brazil, but
provides scant details about Providence Financial’s or Providence Fund’s operations or
how those companies will use investor funds to engage in factoring transactions.
41.

The Information Memorandum additionally states that one of Providence

Financial’s main philosophies is to: “Provide investment safety with real high yield
returns.” The Information Memorandum additionally represents, in a section titled
“Charges”: “There are no fixed charges to clients.”
42.

The website similarly states, in a section titled “Charges”: “No fees or

charges to our lenders [the promissory note holders].”
43.

The Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum, and website

each fail to disclose any use for the note proceeds other than investing in factoring
transactions in Brazil. For instance, none of the offering materials provided to investors
disclosed that Providence Financial and Providence Fund would pay 6% annual
commissions on each promissory note sold. The offering materials additionally do not
11

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 12 of 26

disclose that, from 2011 to 2015, a small set of Providence Group executives have
received nearly $9 million from Providence Group’s U.S. entities.
44.

These offering materials also do not disclose information describing the

current financial condition, the current assets and liabilities, or the ability to repay
investors, of Providence Financial, Providence Fund, or their related entities. Moreover,
beyond general statements downplaying the risks of the investment, the offering materials
contain little, if any, disclosures about the risks attendant to receivables factoring,
generally, or the promissory notes, in particular.
III.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund Face Serious Financial Problems.
45.

Contrary to their representation that the “sole” use of investor proceeds

would be to fund Brazilian factoring transactions, Providence Financial and Providence
Fund deployed at least 32% of investor proceeds on expenditures other than receivables
factoring.
46.

One result of Providence Financial and Providence Fund expending large

portions of investor proceeds for uses other than factoring is that they hold receivables
investments that are significantly lower in value than their obligations to investors. For
example, at year-end 2014, Providence Financial and Providence Fund owed investors
more than $52 million, yet their Brazilian affiliates held only $13 million in receivables
assets. For 2015, Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s obligations to U.S.
investors had increased to $64 million, yet their receivables investments had dwindled to
$10.6 million.

12

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 13 of 26

47.

Moreover, Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s Brazilian

affiliates have faced difficulties collecting certain of their accounts receivable.
48.

Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s current financial situation

appears extremely tenuous. Based on the most current bank statements available,
Providence Financial and Providence Fund hold less than $250,000, spread through 28
accounts.
49.

Compounding these problems, Brazil’s currency has sharply devalued

against the U.S. dollar, with a nearly 50% decline in 2015. As a result, Providence
Financial and Providence Fund cannot repatriate their Brazilian assets to repay the U.S.
investors without suffering significant currency exchange losses. Accordingly, the only
way Providence Financial and Providence Fund are able to repay U.S. investors is
through the proceeds of new investments.
50.

Nevertheless, Providence Financial and Providence Fund continue to offer

the promissory notes to U.S. investors, and do so without disclosing any of the financial
concerns described above.
IV.

Buzaneli Controlled Providence Financial and Providence Fund
51.

Buzaneli controlled all aspects of the day-to-day operations of Providence

Financial and Providence Fund until those entities filed for bankruptcy. Buzaneli signed
consents on behalf of both Providence Financial and Providence Fund with respect to the
agreed upon injunctive relief entered by the court at the outset of the litigation in this
matter.

13

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 14 of 26

52.

Buzaneli ran the companies’ purported factoring operations, including the

companies’ efforts to sell notes to fund those transactions; executed notes on behalf of
Providence Financial and Providence Fund; recruited brokers such as Churchfield to sell
notes; and controlled daily cash flow transactions.
53.

The Providence Financial website described Buzaneli as its CEO and as a

“Co-Founder of the Providence Companies Group” and stated that Buzaneli “is the
driving force behind the group’s receivable financing activities.” Certain versions of the
Executive Documents provided to investors also make the same claim – that Buzaneli “is
the driving force behind the group’s factoring activities.”
54.

Defendant Jerrell testified that he was told that certain payments were late

because “[Buzaneli] hasn’t processed that yet.” Jerrell also testified that “Antonio gives
the go ahead when to send payments for groupings like if it’s bills or clients or,
everything comes through Antonio. So, even though [an employee of Providence] is the
accounts payable, she can’t pay things until Antonio tells her to pay.”
55.

Buzaneli also had signatory authority with respect to Providence

Financial’s and Providence Fund’s bank accounts; was listed as the contact point for
further information on Providence Financial’s Executive Memorandum; and executed the
bulk of the notes purchased by investors in Providence Financial and Providence Fund.
56.

Buzaneli employed a scheme and engaged in a course of business by which

he used Providence Financial and Providence Fund to raise money from investors who
were told that their note proceeds would be used to generate enormous profits via lowrisk investment in factoring transactions in Brazil. But Buzaneli then used Providence
14

CASE 0:16-cv-01877-SRN-FLN Document 67 Filed 08/25/16 Page 15 of 26

Financial and Providence Fund to divert significant amounts of investor proceeds to other
entities in the Providence Group that appear to have been controlled by Buzaneli.
57.

When subpoenaed by the SEC for testimony, Buzaneli asserted his rights

under the Fifth Amendment.
