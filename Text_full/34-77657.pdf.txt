ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO RULE
102(e) OF THE COMMISSION’S RULES OF
PRACTICE, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Laura P.
Messenbaugh (“Respondent” or “Messenbaugh”) pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(i) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice.1

1

Rule 102(e)(3)(i) provides, in relevant part, that:

The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing,
may, by order, . . . suspend from appearing or practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has
been by name . . . permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting
the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations
thereunder.

II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over her and the subject matter of these
proceedings, and the findings contained in Section III.3 below, which are admitted, Respondent
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Rule 102(e)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
Messenbaugh, age 51, is and has been a certified public accountant licensed
to practice in the State of Washington. She served as Chief Accounting Officer and Vice President
of Finance and Accounting of SMF Energy Corp. (“SMF”) from approximately 2007 until at least
March 2012.
2.
SMF was, at all relevant times, a publicly-held Delaware corporation,
headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, whose primary businesses were commercial mobilefueling and lubricant distribution. At all relevant times, SMF’s common stock was registered with
the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) and traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “FUEL”.
3.
On April 6, 2016, by consent, a Final Judgment was entered against
Messenbaugh, permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules
10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a),
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13
thereunder, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Laura P.
Messenbaugh, et al., Civil Action Number 15-62028-CIV in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida. Messenbaugh was also barred from serving as an officer or
director; ordered to pay disgorgement of $11,010 and $1,408 of prejudgment interest thereon; and
ordered to pay a $60,000 civil money penalty.
4.
The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that
Messenbaugh, and the other defendants, participated in a fraudulent billing scheme involving SMF.
The Commission further alleged that from approximately June 2010 through mid-March 2012 this
scheme misled investors by materially overstating SMF’s financial performance and falsely
attributing SMF’s purported improved financial results to legitimate business factors, while not
disclosing that in reality the purported improvement in its financial results was due to the
fraudulent billing scheme. Additionally, the Commission alleged that this scheme caused SMF to
2

provide financial statements to the investing public that were not in compliance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, and that Messenbaugh and other provided false information to
SMF’s independent auditors.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanction agreed to in Respondent Messenbaugh’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:
Messenbaugh is suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an
accountant.
By the Commission.
Brent J. Fields
Secretary
