ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION AND POSTPONING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On February 17, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This proceeding has already ended with respect to all respondents but Ceyoniq AG (n/k/a
Ceyoniq, Inc.). See Ceyoniq AG, Initial Decision Release No. 999, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1346 (ALJ
Apr. 12, 2016), finality order, Exchange Act Release No. 77986, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1969 (June
3, 2016). A telephonic prehearing conference is scheduled for August 31, 2016, at 11:00 a.m.
EDT.
On July 25, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a motion seeking leave to serve
Ceyoniq AG with the OIP by publication in the International New York Times newspaper. I
denied without prejudice the Division’s motion because the Division did not demonstrate “the
unavailability of other methods of service, such as personal service by agent or process server,
which may be better calculated to provide notice of this proceeding.” Ceyoniq AG, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 4033, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2655, at *3 (ALJ Aug. 1, 2016). I noted that the
Division “may renew its request for service by publication” if it “is unable to effect service on
Ceyoniq AG by other means.” Id.
On August 25, 2016, the Division filed a motion for reconsideration of its motion to serve
Ceyoniq AG with the OIP by publication in the International New York Times newspaper. The
motion describes the Division’s additional unsuccessful efforts to locate and serve the company.
Attached to the motion and accompanying declaration are: (1) emails exchanged with a
representative of a company with a similar name located in the same town informing the
Division that the company had no legal relationship to Ceyoniq AG and was not its legal
successor (Exs. 1-2); (2) articles published by Bankrupt.com stating that Ceyoniq AG filed for

insolvency in Germany in 2002 (Exs. 3-4); (3) German news articles indicating that Ceyoniq AG
filed for bankruptcy in Germany in 2002 and two of its officers were arrested for fraud (Ex. 5);
(4) emails exchanged with the German Embassy and the local Chamber of Commerce and
Industry in Bielefeld, Germany, attempting to locate a contact for Ceyoniq AG (Exs. 6, 8-9); (5)
a June 2010 letter from the Hague Convention Authority for the German lander of BadenWürttemberg sent to the Division in another administrative proceeding noting that “[u]nder
German case law, no effective service can be made on the bankruptcy trustee if . . . the complaint
is directed against the bankrupt” (Ex. 7); (6) an email from Ceyoniq AG’s German bankruptcy
liquidator attaching the court order terminating the bankruptcy proceeding (Ex. 10); and (7) a
printout of the Judicial Assistance Article on Germany from the U.S. Department of State’s
website (Ex. 11).
In its initial motion, the Division requested permission to serve Ceyoniq AG through
publication in the International New York Times (formerly the International Herald Tribune),
which is an English-language newspaper with a daily non-U.S. circulation of 213,049, once a
week for four consecutive weeks. Initial Motion at 1 & n.1, 4, 7, Ex. 9. Service by publication
is not prohibited by German law, according to information provided by the Division. See id. at
5, Ex. 8.
Any service method must be “reasonably calculated to give notice.” 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(iv). I am satisfied that the Division has exhausted other service options, and it
appears that service by publication, even on defunct corporations with known addresses, is
considered reasonable in Germany.
I therefore GRANT the Division’s motion for
reconsideration and GRANT its request to serve Ceyoniq AG through publication in the
International New York Times newspaper, for four consecutive weeks, of the notice attached as
Exhibit 3 to the Division’s initial motion.
In its motion for reconsideration, the Division also requests that the prehearing
conference scheduled for August 31, 2016, be postponed. The prehearing conference is
POSTPONED and a telephonic prehearing conference shall be held on October 31, 2016, at
11:00 a.m. EDT, if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
SO ORDERED.
