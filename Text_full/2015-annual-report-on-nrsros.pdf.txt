ANNUAL REPORT ON NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED
STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS
As Required by Section 6 of the Credit Rating Agency
Reform Act of 2006
I.

INTRODUCTION

The staff (the “Staff”) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“Commission” or “SEC”) is providing this report (“Report”) regarding nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations (“NRSROs”) pursuant to Section 6 of the Credit Rating Agency
Reform Act of 2006 (“Rating Agency Act”).1 This Report reflects solely the Staff’s views.
Section 6 of the Rating Agency Act requires the Commission to submit an annual report
(“Annual Report”) to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the U.S. Senate
and the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives that, with respect
to the year to which the Annual Report relates:




identifies applicants for registration as NRSROs under Section 15E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”); 2
specifies the number of, and actions taken on, such applications; and
specifies the views of the Commission on the state of competition, transparency, and
conflicts of interest among NRSROs.

This Report relates generally to the period from June 26, 2014 to June 25, 2015 (the
“Report Period”). In addition to addressing the items specified in Section 6 of the Rating
Agency Act, this Report provides an overview of certain Commission and Staff activities
relating to NRSROs.
Information regarding the topics covered in this Report with respect to prior periods can
be found on the Office of Credit Ratings (“OCR” or the “Office”) page of the Commission’s
website.3

Pub. L. No. 109-291, 120 Stat. 1327 (Sept. 29, 2006). The Rating Agency Act, among other things, added
Section 15E to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. §78o-7) to establish self-executing
requirements on NRSROs and provide the Commission with the authority to implement a registration and
oversight program for NRSROs. In June 2007, the Commission approved rules implementing such a
program. See Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, Release No. 34-55857, 72 FR 33564 (Jun. 18, 2007), available at

III. ACTIVITIES RELATING TO NRSROs
A.

Activities

The creation of OCR was mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”)7 and the Office was established in June 2012 with
the appointment of its Director, Thomas Butler. OCR is responsible for the oversight of credit
rating agencies registered with the Commission as NRSROs. OCR’s Staff includes professionals
with expertise in a variety of areas that relate to its regulatory mission, such as corporate,
municipal, and structured debt finance.8
OCR’s responsibilities – as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act – include conducting an
examination of each NRSRO at least annually in eight specified review areas.9 Information
regarding the examinations, including those that concluded during the Report Period, is included
in OCR’s annual examination reports.10
In connection with its regulatory mission, OCR also monitors trends and developments
affecting the credit rating industry. For example, during the Report Period, OCR Staff met with
each NRSRO to discuss rating and industry developments and met with the board of directors of
certain NRSROs to discuss, among other things, compliance and oversight matters. OCR Staff
also met with a variety of other market participants, including investors, issuers, and industry
organizations, to discuss matters relevant to the credit rating industry. OCR Staff also attended
various conferences, seminars, and other events addressing topics applicable to the industry.
These monitoring activities are focused on informing Commission policy and rulemaking and
NRSRO examinations.
During the Report Period, OCR Staff also continued to participate in meetings that
involved rating agency regulators globally, including those of the International Organization of
6

On January 21, 2015, S&P consented to a Commission order under which, among other things, S&P agreed to
refrain from making preliminary or final ratings for any new issue U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS transaction for a
period of twelve months from the date of the order, including engaging in any marketing activity related thereto.
See In the Matter of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Release Nos. 33-9705 and 34-74104 (Jan. 21, 2015),

Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) Committee 6 on Credit Rating Agencies11 and the
supervisory colleges that were formed at IOSCO’s recommendation for the largest
internationally active credit rating agencies.12 During the Report Period, the colleges held an inperson meeting and conducted quarterly calls. OCR Staff also conducted additional discussions
with international regulators as appropriate.
B.

Commission Releases and Orders and Other Staff Publications

From the beginning of the Report Period to the date preceding the issuance of this
Report, the below-listed final rule releases, proposing rule releases, Commission orders, and
other Staff publications were issued relating to NRSROs or credit ratings in general.


Final Rules: Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Release No. 3472936 (Aug. 27, 2014), 79 FR 55077 (Sept. 15, 2014) (“Adopting Release”).13 In
accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and to enhance its oversight responsibilities, the
Commission adopted amendments to existing rules and new rules that apply to NRSROs.
The adopted amendments and new rules (collectively, the “New NRSRO Rules”) address
the following areas, among others: filing annual reports on internal control structures;
addressing conflicts of interest with respect to sales and marketing considerations; taking
certain actions when a review conducted by an NRSRO determines that a conflict of
interest relating to post-NRSRO employment influenced a credit rating; enhancing and
standardizing disclosure of credit rating performance statistics; consolidating and
expanding the scope of credit rating histories to be disclosed by NRSROs; requiring
certain policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies used to
determine credit ratings; publishing a form with certain rating actions disclosing
information about the credit rating and any applicable certification by a provider of thirdparty due diligence services; requiring the establishment by NRSROs of standards of
training, experience, and competence for credit rating analysts; and requiring policies and
procedures that are designed to ensure the consistent application of rating symbols and
definitions. In addition to NRSROs, the New NRSRO Rules also apply to providers of
third-party due diligence services for asset-backed securities and issuers and underwriters
of asset-backed securities. The New NRSRO Rules became effective on various dates
during the Report Period (i.e., November 14, 2014, January 1, 2015 and June 15, 2015).

11

IOSCO Committee 6 was formed to evaluate and consider regulatory and policy initiatives relating to credit rating
agencies’ activities and oversight and facilitate regular dialogue between regulators and the credit rating industry.
The SEC chairs Committee 6, and OCR Staff represents the SEC in this regard. In March 2015, IOSCO published
the final report on Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies, available at:
https://www.iosco.org/news/pdf/IOSCONEWS375.pdf.

12

The supervisory colleges were formed to enhance communication among credit rating agency regulators globally
with respect to examinations of the relevant credit rating agencies. See Supervisory Colleges for Credit Rating
Agencies, Final Report (July 2013), available at http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD416.pdf.
The SEC serves as chair of the colleges for S&P and Moody’s, and OCR Staff represents the SEC in this regard.
The European Securities and Markets Authority serves as chair of the college for Fitch.



Final Rule: Asset-Backed Securities Disclosure and Registration, Release Nos. 33-9638
and 34-72982 (Sept. 4, 2014), 79 FR 57183 (Sept. 24, 2014).14 The Commission adopted
revisions to Regulation AB and other rules governing the offering process, disclosure,
and reporting for asset-backed securities. The final rules require that, with some
exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 and
ongoing reports under the Exchange Act of asset-backed securities backed by real estate
assets, auto-related assets, or debt securities, contain specified asset-level information
about each asset in the pool. The asset-level information is required to be provided
according to specified standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup
Language. The Commission also adopted rules revising filing deadlines for asset-backed
securities offerings and new registration forms tailored to asset-backed securities
offerings. Credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for asset-backed securities
issuers were repealed and new criteria established, pursuant to Section 939A of the
Dodd-Frank Act. 



Final Rule: Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Release Nos. 33-9874, 34-75586, 392505, and IC-31735 (Aug. 3, 2015), 80 FR 51123 (Aug. 24, 2015).15 The Commission adopted
revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system and
related rules to reflect updates, including those enabling NRSROs to deliver certain forms and
reports to the Commission electronically, as required under the new rules adopted by the
Commission with respect to NRSROs on August 27, 2014.



Final Rule: Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings and Amendment to the
Issuer Diversification Requirement in the Money Market Fund Rule, Release No. IC31828 (Sept. 16, 2015), 80 FR 58124 (Sept. 25, 2015).16 The Commission adopted
amendments to address provisions that reference credit ratings in Rule 2a-7 and Form NMFP, under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Specifically, the amendments to Rule
2a-7 replace references to credit ratings in the rule with alternative standards designed to
maintain a similar level of credit quality as under the rule prior to the amendments. The
amendments to Form N-MFP require that a fund disclose any credit rating that the fund’s
board considered in determining the credit quality of a portfolio security. The
amendments were adopted pursuant to Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act, and finalize
the re-proposed rule described below.



Re-Proposed Rule: Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings and Amendment to
the Issuer Diversification Requirement in the Money Market Fund Rule, Release No. IC31184 (July 23, 2014), 79 FR 47985 (Aug. 14, 2014).17 The Commission re-proposed
amendments to address provisions that reference credit ratings in Rule 2a-7 and Form NMFP, under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Specifically, the proposed
amendments to Rule 2a-7 would replace references to credit ratings in the rule with
alternative standards designed to maintain a similar level of credit quality as under the
rule prior to the amendments. The proposed amendments to Form N-MFP would require
that a fund disclose any credit rating that the fund’s board considered in determining the

A.

Select NRSRO Statistics

Sections 1 through 3 below summarize and discuss certain information reported by
NRSROs on Form NRSRO30 or pursuant to Rule 17g-3 that provides insight into the state of
competition among NRSROs. While this information indicates the high percentage of
outstanding ratings that continue to be issued by Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch, other information
demonstrates that smaller NRSROs have been able to make competitive inroads in certain rating
categories.31

Form NRSRO is the application for registration as an NRSRO under Section 15E and Rule 17g-1. Rule
17g-1 requires an applicant/NRSRO to use Form NRSRO for the following, as applicable:
 an initial application to be registered as an NRSRO;
 an application to register for an additional class of credit ratings;
 an application supplement;
 an update of registration pursuant to Section 15E(b)(1);
 an annual certification pursuant to Section 15E(b)(2); and
 a withdrawal of registration pursuant to Section 15E(e).
See http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/formnrsro.pdf for additional information.

31

For example, information regarding current market share among NRSROs in the asset-backed securities category
is published on the websites of Commercial Mortgage Alert (https://www.cmalert.com/) and Asset-Backed Alert
(https://www.abalert.com/) and is discussed in Section IV(B)(1) of this Report. In addition, Section IV(B)(2) of
this Report provides examples of certain asset classes in which smaller NRSROs have been able to gain market
share and discusses other developments relevant to competition among NRSROs.

NRSRO Credit Ratings Outstanding
(a)

Number of Outstanding Ratings in Statutory Rating Categories

Each NRSRO annually reports the number of credit ratings outstanding in each rating
category for which it is registered.32 This information, which is summarized in Charts 1 through
9 below, can be useful in determining the breadth of an NRSRO’s coverage with respect to
issuers and obligors within a particular rating class.
Comparing the number of ratings outstanding for established NRSROs and newer
NRSROs may not provide a comprehensive picture of the state of competition. Certain NRSROs
(particularly S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch) have a longer history of issuing ratings and their ratings
include those for debt obligations and obligors that were rated well before the establishment of
the newer entrants.33 Consequently, the information described in Section IV(B)(1) of this Report
(relating to recent market share developments in the asset-backed securities rating category) may
provide a better gauge of how well newer entrants are competing with more established rating
agencies, specifically in the asset-backed securities rating category.
Chart 1 provides the number of outstanding credit ratings reported by each NRSRO in its
annual certification for the calendar year ending December 31, 2014, in each of the five
categories identified in Section 3(a)(62) for which the NRSRO is registered, as applicable.

32

Annual certifications on Form NRSRO must be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-1(f) and made
publicly and freely available on each NRSRO’s website pursuant to Rule 17g-1(i). The number of outstanding
credit ratings for each class of credit ratings for which an NRSRO is registered is reported on Item 7A of Form
NRSRO.

33

The ratings counts disclosed on Item 7A of Form NRSRO include all credit ratings currently outstanding,
regardless of when they were issued. As a result, the ratings counts of the more established NRSROs may include
credit ratings that were issued before the newer entrants began issuing credit ratings. These earlier ratings will
continue to be included in the disclosed ratings counts until the rated securities are repaid or the credit ratings are
otherwise withdrawn. Because all outstanding ratings are included in the ratings counts, historical results factor
significantly into the disclosed number of ratings, making it more difficult to discern current-year trends and
identify gains achieved by the newer entrants.

Chart 2 displays the percentage of total credit ratings that were issued by each NRSRO,
and charts 3 through 7 depict the percentages of credit ratings in each rating category that were
attributable to each NRSRO that is registered in such category, in each case, based on
information reported by the NRSROs as of December 31, 2014.35, 36

34

Effective January 1, 2015, Item 7A of Form NRSRO and the corresponding instructions were amended to clarify
the manner in which the number of outstanding credit ratings should be calculated and presented. The clarifying
amendments are designed to better ensure that disclosures on Item 7A of Form NRSRO are consistent across
NRSROs. Although NRSROs were not required to adhere to the updated instructions for the annual certifications
pertaining to the year ended December 31, 2014, the change in instructions may have caused some NRSROs to
modify the way they count ratings for purposes of Item 7A of Form NRSRO, which may affect comparisons to
disclosures made in prior years. See Adopting Release, 79 FR at 55220-22 (discussing the clarifying amendments
to Item 7A of Form NRSRO).

35

For example, according to Chart 1, A.M. Best reported that it had 7,910 insurance company credit ratings,
and the total of the credit ratings in that category reported by all NRSROs was 22,335. Dividing 7,910 by
22,335 equals (approximately) 0.354 or 35.4% (which is the percentage of NRSRO insurance company
ratings attributable to A.M. Best, as shown on Chart 4).

S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch continue to be the three NRSROs with the highest number of
ratings reported to be outstanding as of December 31, 2014. As illustrated in Chart 2, in total,
these NRSROs issued 95.8% of all the ratings that were reported to be outstanding as of
December 31, 2014, slightly lower than 96.6% as of December 31, 2013. In 2007, the year when
NRSROs began reporting outstanding ratings on Form NRSRO, these NRSROs accounted for
98.8% of all outstanding ratings.
Charts 3 through 7 show that, as of December 31, 2014, Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch were
also the top three issuers of ratings in every rating category except for insurance ratings, in which
A.M. Best specializes. In that category, A.M. Best issued about 35.4% of the ratings
outstanding, which was the highest percentage among the NRSROs. S&P issued about 30.4% of
the outstanding insurance ratings, which was the second highest percentage. Moody’s and Fitch
issued about 14.9% and 13.5%, respectively, of such ratings. A.M. Best has consistently
reported being one of the top three issuers of insurance ratings since this information began to be
reported in 2007. In each other rating category, S&P reported the highest percentage of
outstanding ratings, Moody’s reported the second highest percentage, and Fitch reported the
third highest percentage.
Chart 8 depicts the percentages of outstanding credit ratings attributable to each rating
category, based on information reported by the NRSROs as of December 31, 2014.

As illustrated by Chart 8, as of December 31, 2014, a disproportionate number of the
aggregate credit ratings reported to be outstanding were in the government securities category,
which may be attributable to the large number of government bond issuers and their multiple
debt offerings. The government securities category accounted for 76.6% of the total number of
credit ratings reported across all categories and, as shown on Chart 7, is also the most
concentrated rating category, with 88.6% of all outstanding government ratings reported having
been issued by Moody’s and S&P.

12

Given the disproportionate size of the government securities rating category relative to
the other rating categories and the high concentration of NRSROs rating government securities,
the inclusion of the government securities category in the calculation of total market share for
each NRSRO may make it difficult to assess the relative market shares of the smaller NRSROs.
Chart 9 depicts the percentages of the credit ratings attributable to each NRSRO over all
rating categories other than the government securities category, based on information reported by

rating categories other than government securities.

A comparison of Chart 9 to Chart 2 (which shows each NRSRO’s total market share over
all rating categories, including government securities) illustrates that there is more competition in
the non-government rating categories. Moody’s and S&P’s percentage share of the overall
market declines by 5.0% and 12.2%, respectively, when government securities are excluded.
Fitch’s percentage share of outstanding ratings, on the other hand, increases by 6.5% when
government securities are excluded. The percentage market share for all the remaining NRSROs
other than HR Ratings (which is only registered in the government securities category) also
increases when government securities are excluded. Further, when government securities are
included in the total calculation, all but one of these smaller NRSROs have less than 1.0% of the
market share, making it difficult to assess their relative market shares. When government
securities are excluded, a clearer picture of the relative market shares of the smaller NRSROs
can be observed, as illustrated in Chart 9.
As discussed above, the number of outstanding ratings reported by the NRSROs provides
insights into the state of competition in each rating class and in the aggregate, but assessing the
state of competition based on this data has some limitations. For instance, some NRSROs have

13

pursued business strategies to specialize in particular rating categories or sub-categories37 and
may not plan to issue ratings in certain of the other rating categories. Also, the reported
information does not reflect any classes of ratings being issued by NRSROs in which they are
not registered with the Commission, nor does it reflect ratings issued by an affiliate of an
NRSRO unless the affiliate is identified as a credit rating affiliate on Item 3 of Form NRSRO.
Further, the outstanding ratings reported by the NRSROs are based on their own
determinations of the applicable categories and number of ratings, which are not necessarily
consistent among all the NRSROs. As NRSROs adjust their ratings count disclosures in
accordance with the new instructions to Form NRSRO (which are designed to enhance
comparability across NRSROs), comparisons to ratings counts disclosed in prior years may also
be affected.38
(b)

Industry Concentration

Economists generally measure industry concentration, which indicates the
competitiveness of an industry, by using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (“HHI”).39 The
inverse of the HHI (“HHI Inverse”) can be used to represent the number of firms with equal
market share necessary to replicate the degree of concentration in a particular industry.40 In
other words, an industry with an HHI Inverse of 3.0 has a concentration that is equal to an
industry where the entire market is evenly divided among three firms. A highly concentrated
market will have a low HHI Inverse, whereas an unconcentrated market will have a high HHI
Inverse.41
Calculations of the HHI and HHI Inverse for the NRSRO industry are consistent with the
results included in Section IV(A)(1)(a) of this Report and further illustrate competitive inroads
made by smaller NRSROs in certain rating categories. Based on the number of outstanding
ratings included in such section,42 the HHI Inverse indicates that the NRSRO industry constitutes
a “highly concentrated” market, and has the equivalent concentration of an industry with
approximately 2.68 firms with equal market share. This is consistent with the high proportion of
37

For example, A.M. Best with respect to insurance companies and their affiliates; JCR with respect to Japanese
issuers and securities; and HR Ratings with respect to Mexican securities.

38

See supra note 34.

39

See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, Horizontal Merger Guidelines
§5.3 (2010) (discussing how the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission use HHI to
measure the impact of a merger on market concentration); however, since the HHI calculation does not take
into account that multiple NRSROs may rate a single issue, different considerations may be applicable to
the use of the HHI calculation for NRSROs.

40

The HHI Inverse is calculated by dividing 10,000 (i.e., the highest possible HHI) by the HHI. For additional
discussion of the HHI Inverse, see Vera Pawlowsky-Glahn and Antonella Buccianti, Compositional Data
Analysis: Theory and Applications (2011); Toby Roberts, When Bigger is Better: A Critique of the HerfindahlHirschman Index’s Use to Evaluate Mergers in Network Industries, 34 PACE L. REV. 894, 908 (2014).

41

A market with an HHI Inverse of less than 4.0 is considered to be highly concentrated; a market with an HHI
Inverse between 4.0 and 6.67 is considered to be moderately concentrated; and a market with an HHI Inverse
above 6.67 is considered to be unconcentrated. See generally U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission, Horizontal Merger Guidelines §5.3 (2010).

remains highly concentrated, a comparison of the HHI Inverse calculations since 2010 shows
that each rating category other than the government securities category has become less
concentrated.

As mentioned in Section IV(A)(1)(a) of this Report, as of December 31, 2014, the
government securities rating category (which includes sovereigns, U.S. public finance, and
international public finance) is the largest class of ratings (comprising approximately 76.6% of
all ratings outstanding) and is dominated by S&P and Moody’s (which together issued 88.6% of
all outstanding government ratings). Given the disproportionate size of the government
securities rating category relative to the other rating categories and the high concentration of
NRSROs rating government securities, the inclusion of the government securities category in the
calculation of the aggregate HHI Inverse may make it difficult to assess the level of market
concentration in the other four rating categories.
Chart 10 illustrates that the financial institutions, insurance companies, corporate issuers,
and asset-backed securities categories of credit ratings are significantly less concentrated than
the government securities rating category. The aggregate HHI Inverse for these four rating
categories is 3.81, which is 1.13 higher than the aggregate HHI Inverse when government
securities are included. Chart 10 also shows that, when government securities are excluded, the
aggregate HHI Inverse for all other rating categories has increased by 0.25 since 2008, showing
that industry concentration has declined somewhat for these rating categories.43
43

Unlike the financial institutions and asset-backed securities rating categories, the HHI Inverse for the insurance
companies and corporate issuers categories decreased (indicating higher concentration) when compared to 2008.
However, the HHI Inverse increased (indicating lesser concentration) for these two latter rating categories when
compared to 2010.

The three largest NRSROs report employing 4,012 credit analysts (including
supervisors), which is approximately 88.6% of the total number employed by all of the
NRSROs. Although the smaller NRSROs in the aggregate employ only approximately 11.4%
of all credit analysts employed by NRSROs, this percentage has increased steadily in recent
years,45 and some of the smaller NRSROs have reported significant increases in their analytical
staff.46 The trend in the number of rating analysts employed by an NRSRO can indicate the
state of the NRSRO’s business or its business outlook–i.e., NRSROs that are increasing their
staff may be experiencing or anticipating an increase in ratings volumes or planning to enter
new markets.

44

Effective January 1, 2015, the instructions for Exhibit 8 of Form NRSRO were amended to clarify that NRSROs
must include credit analyst supervisors in the total number of credit analysts disclosed on Exhibit 8. This
amendment was designed to enhance consistency of the disclosures on Exhibit 8 of Form NRSRO. Prior to this
amendment, some NRSROs may have excluded credit analyst supervisors from the total number of credit analysts
disclosed.

45

Based on amounts reported by the currently registered NRSROs on their annual certifications for the applicable
calendar year, the smaller NRSROs employed approximately 7.5% of all NRSRO analysts in 2010, 8.3% of all
NRSRO analysts in 2011, 9.2% of all NRSRO analysts in 2012, and 9.6% of all NRSRO analysts in 2013. A
portion of the increase since 2012 is attributable to the registration of HR Ratings as an NRSRO in 2012.

46

For example, KBRA reported on its most recent annual certification that it employs 96 credit analysts and
supervisors, as compared to 13 reported for 2010.

NRSRO Revenue Growth

The total revenue reported to the Commission47 by all of the NRSROs for their 2014
fiscal year was approximately $5.9 billion, which was an increase of 9.0% from the 2013 fiscal
year. Revenue at Moody’s, Fitch, and S&P was reported to have increased from 2013 to 2014 by
9.0%, 8.7%, and 8.0%, respectively.48 Chart 12 shows the percentage of total NRSRO revenues
accounted for by S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s since 2011. As illustrated by Chart 12, the relative
percentages of total NRSRO revenues between the three largest NRSROs and the other NRSROs
have remained relatively constant over the past four years.

Moody’s Corporation, the owner of Moody’s, attributes the growth in revenues at
Moody’s to certain pricing increases, higher issuance volumes for investment-grade

high-yield corporate debt, as well as an unfavorable issuance mix in the banking sector.49

McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (“MHFI”) attributes the increase in revenues at S&P, a
business unit under the ownership of MHFI, to growth in both corporate and financial

Recent Developments in the State of Competition among NRSROs

Market Share Developments in the Asset-Backed Securities Rating
Category

Based on information from the websites of Commercial Mortgage Alert and AssetBacked Alert,53 some of the smaller NRSROs have built significant market shares in the assetbacked securities rating category. These websites, which allow NRSROs to self-report the
transactions that they have rated, indicate that the growth trend the Staff has observed since the
2012 Annual Report continued during the Report Period. Sections (a) and (b) below include
market share information reported on these websites as to commercial mortgage-backed
securities (“CMBS”), asset-backed securities (“ABS”), and mortgage-backed securities
(“MBS”), as further described in the following paragraph.54
The following definitions from the Commercial Mortgage Alert and Asset-Backed Alert
websites apply to the determination of reported market share numbers: (i) CMBS is comprised
of transactions collateralized by mortgages or leases on commercial or multi-family incomeproducing properties;55 (ii) the ABS category is comprised of securities that are collateralized
by assets (excluding mortgages, commercial paper, and other continuously offered securities

The charts reflect market share percentages based on dollar amounts of issuance. The market shares of
individual NRSROs do not add up to 100% since more than one NRSRO may rate a particular transaction
or obligor. CMBS market share data is from the Commercial Mortgage Alert. See
https://www.cmalert.com/rankings.pl.

59

The term “conduit” refers to a financial intermediary that functions as a link, or conduit, between the
lender(s) originating loans and the ultimate investor(s). The conduit makes loans to, or purchases loans
from, third parties under standardized terms, underwriting, and documents and then, when sufficient
volume has been accumulated, pools the loans for sale to investors in the CMBS market. The term
“fusion” refers to the combination within one CMBS of conduit loans, small loans and large loans. See
http://www.crefc.org/uploadedFiles/CMSA_Site_Home/Industry_Resources/Research/Glossary.pdf. In
contrast, a single borrower transaction includes commercial mortgage loans made to a single borrower.

Total U.S. CMBS ratings include conduit/fusion CMBS, single-borrower CMBS, and other types of
CMBS, such as distressed/non-performing CMBS transactions and resecuritizations of CMBS transactions.

* Charts 13-15 reflect market share percentages based on dollar amounts of issuance.

The market shares of individual NRSROs do not add up to 100%

since more than one NRSRO may rate a particular transaction or obligor.

Moody’s had the highest market share in the U.S. CMBS sector during the Report Period.
Moody’s rated 65.1% and 65.9% of all rated U.S. CMBS in the first half of 2015 and full year
2014, respectively. Moody’s market share was particularly strong in the U.S. conduit/fusion
CMBS sector, where it rated one or more tranches of all rated transactions issued in the first half
of 2015 and 94.0% of the transactions rated in 2014.
During the Report Period, there was a trend of certain larger NRSROs rating only the
more senior tranches of U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS transactions, while smaller NRSROs
generally rated both the senior and subordinate tranches of the same transactions.61 This trend
reflects significant inroads being made by certain smaller NRSROs into the U.S. CMBS sector.
KBRA and Morningstar had the second and third highest market shares in the U.S. CMBS
sector, respectively, during the first half of 2015. KBRA rated 56.6% of rated U.S. CMBS
61

during the first half of 2015, which is comparable to its market shares in 2013 and 2014.
Morningstar rated 44.4% of rated U.S. CMBS during the first half of 2015, an increase from
33.1% in 2014. The increase in market share for each of KBRA and Morningstar is largely
attributable to their growth in the U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS sector of CMBS ratings. KBRA’s
market share in this sector was 75.7% in the first half of 2015, which is an increase from 68.0%
in 2014, and Morningstar’s market share in this sector increased to 45.1% in the first half of
2015 from 25.2% in 2014. DBRS also achieved sizeable market share in the U.S.
conduit/fusion CMBS sector, rating 51.4% of the transactions in the first half of 2015 and
56.6% of the transactions in 2014.
The market share results from the first half of 2015 for U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS may
have also been affected by a settlement, dated January 21, 2015, between S&P and the
Commission regarding charges relating to S&P’s ratings on certain conduit/fusion CMBS.62
The settlement terms include a one-year timeout from marketing or rating new issue
conduit/fusion CMBS transactions. As shown in Chart 14, S&P did not rate any U.S.
conduit/fusion CMBS transactions in the first half of 2015.

* Charts 16 and 17 reflect market share percentages based on dollar amounts of issuance. The market shares of individual NRSROs do
not add up to 100% since more than one NRSRO may rate a particular transaction or obligor.

As Chart 16 shows, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch continue to have the largest market shares
in the U.S. ABS sector. However, the smaller NRSROs have increased their market shares in
this sector during the first half of 2015. DBRS increased its market share from 8.4% in 2013 to
17.5% in the first half of 2015, while KBRA increased its market share from 2.0% to 10.0%
over the same time period. As indicated by data on the Asset-Backed Alert website,
Morningstar began rating U.S. ABS in 2015 and had a reported market share of 4.5% during the
first half of 2015.
As Chart 17 shows, DBRS had a market share of 76.2% in the U.S. MBS sector during
the first half of 2015, which was the largest market share of all NRSROs. DBRS also had the
highest market shares in this sector in both 2014 and 2013. Fitch had the second highest market
share reported during the first half of 2015, which increased from 2014.
Moody’s had the largest increase in U.S. MBS market share from 2014 to the first half of
2015. Its market share increased to 24.0% from 4.5% in 2014. KBRA also increased its market
share to 23.8% during this time, up from 19.2% in 2014. Compared to the other NRSROs, S&P
had the largest decline in U.S. MBS market share during the first half of 2015. Its market share
was 13.4% in the first half of 2015, which was the fifth highest market share reported. In 2014,
it had a market share of 41.3%, which was the second highest.

Other NRSRO Developments

In 2015, two smaller NRSROs reported changes in their ownership structures that could
impact opportunities for growth. In March 2015, DBRS was acquired by investors including
The Carlyle Group LP and Warburg Pincus LLC.64 The new owners of DBRS stated that DBRS
would focus on growth opportunities in Europe and emerging markets and in rating complex

bond deals like mortgage-backed securities.65 Additionally, in November 2015, KBRA
announced a recapitalization whereby an existing investor, Wharf Street, LLC, acquired a
majority ownership stake in KBRA.66 According to its announcement of the increased
ownership stake, KBRA believes that the capital raised in the recapitalization will allow it to
continue to grow its credit rating business, and has indicated its intention to expand within the
corporate finance markets and internationally.67
Fitch also reported a change in its ownership structure during the Report Period. In
December 2014, the Hearst Corporation increased its equity interest in Fitch Group (the sole
shareholder of Fitch) from 50% to 80%, by acquiring a 30% equity stake from Fimalac. Fimalac
continues to hold the remaining 20% equity stake in Fitch Group.68
As described in Section IV(B)(1) of this Report, some of the smaller NRSROs have been
experiencing growth in the asset-backed securities rating category, such as in U.S. CMBS.
Additionally, some of the smaller NRSROs are rating newer asset classes (such as single-family
rental (“SFR”) securitizations69 and marketplace lending securitizations70).
KBRA and Morningstar have rated a very high percentage of the SFR securitizations
issued.71 During the Report Period, the first two multi-borrower SFR securitizations72 were
issued, both of which were rated by Morningstar73 and one of which was rated by KBRA.74 One

SFR securitizations are collateralized by rental income from residential rental properties and proceeds from the
sale of residential rental properties. Ratings of the first rated SFR securitization were issued in November 2013.

70

The assets collateralizing marketplace lending securitizations are generally loans that were made through online
platforms that connect borrowers with lenders. The first rated marketplace lending securitization was issued in
December 2013.

71

According to the Asset-Backed Alert’s database, as of June 30, 2015, there have been 23 rated SFR securitizations
issued. Of these deals, 22 were rated by Moody’s, KBRA, and Morningstar, and one was rated by Fitch and
KBRA.

72

Previous SFR securitizations were collateralized by loans to a single borrower. Multi-borrower SFR
securitizations are collateralized by multiple loans to multiple borrowers.

of these multi-borrower SFR securitizations was also rated by Fitch,75 while the other was also
rated by Moody’s.76
Although there were only a few rated marketplace lending transactions during the Report
Period, DBRS has been active in this asset class. DBRS was one of the first NRSROs to issue
ratings on these types of transactions, rating debt issuances collateralized by loans made to
individuals in order to refinance student loans.77 Since that transaction, S&P and Moody’s have
also issued ratings on marketplace lending transactions backed by student loans.78 During the
Report Period, the first marketplace lending transaction collateralized by consumer loans was
issued and rated solely by Moody’s.79
Smaller NRSROs are also rating other new types of asset-backed securities and issuances
commonly referred to as “esoteric” asset-backed securities. For example, during the Review
Period, a smaller NRSRO rated airport revenue bonds,80 property assessed clean energy
securitizations, 81 and tax lien securitizations,82 and two smaller NRSROs rated subprime auto
transactions.83
Some smaller NRSROs continue to pursue expansion in more traditional types of asset-backed
securities as well. For example, during the Report Period, Morningstar publicly announced its first
assignment to rate a non-mortgage asset-backed securitization84 and also rated its first MBS

transaction.85 Additionally, in June 2014, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(“NAIC”) voted to extend Morningstar’s designation on the NAIC Credit Rating Provider List
(“Provider List”) to additional structured finance asset classes.86 The NAIC converts current ratings
from an approved credit rating agency on its Provider List into the equivalent designation on an NAIC
credit risk rating scale that is used to compute risk-based capital requirements of insurance
companies.87
Smaller NRSROs also continue to pursue rating opportunities outside of the asset-backed
securities rating category. For example, during the Report Period, a smaller NRSRO published
criteria articles that describe its methodologies for rating certain public finance and financial
institution issuances.88
C. Barriers to Entry
Despite the notable progress made by smaller NRSROs in gaining market share in some
of the ratings classes (see Section IV(B) of this Report), economic and regulatory barriers to
entry continue to exist in the credit ratings industry, making it difficult for the smaller NRSROs
to compete with the larger NRSROs.
One such potential barrier that is consistently referred to by certain smaller NRSROs is
the minimum ratings requirements that specify use of the ratings of particular rating agencies in
the investment management contracts of institutional fund managers and the investment
guidelines of fixed income mutual fund managers, pension plan sponsors, and endowment fund
managers.89 The effect of these requirements can be to increase the demand and liquidity for

See letter from KBRA to the Commission, dated Aug. 19, 2014, available at:
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-18-11/s71811-88.pdf. This barrier to entry was also mentioned during
the SEC’s Credit Ratings Roundtable held on May 14, 2013. At the roundtable, a representative of
Morningstar mentioned that, according to a study conducted by Morningstar, approximately 42% of the
fixed income funds having investment guidelines referring to ratings specifically referred to S&P, Moody’s
or a “major NRSRO.” See Credit Rating Roundable, May 14, 2013, available at:

securities bearing the ratings of specified rating agencies.90 Historically, many of these
guidelines refer to the ratings from the larger NRSROs by name (i.e., S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch).
However, there have been reports that some investors are changing their guidelines to include
ratings from other NRSROs.91
Another potential barrier to entry is the inclusion requirements of some fixed income
indices. To be included in many of these indices, securities must be rated by specific NRSROs.
These indices are used to evaluate the performance of investment managers, which often try to
mimic the performance of the indices by purchasing the securities included in them. These
inclusion requirements increase the demand and liquidity for securities bearing the ratings of
specific NRSROs. It was reported that, during the Report Period, some indices changed their
requirements to include ratings from smaller NRSROs.92
With respect to potential regulatory barriers to entry, the Commission received public
comments regarding the effect that the proposed rules implementing the NRSRO mandates of the
Dodd-Frank Act (the “Proposed Rules”) would have on competition.93 Generally, these
comments expressed concerns that certain of the Proposed Rules could have negative effects on
competition because they would be burdensome for smaller NRSROs to implement and could
raise barriers to entry for credit rating agencies that seek to register as NRSROs.94 The New
NRSRO Rules include various changes from the Proposed Rules that were intended to address
such comments. For example, the New NRSRO Rules relating to certain disclosure and
reporting requirements were modified from the Proposed Rules in ways that could reduce the

90

The effect of including particular NRSROs in investment guidelines was highlighted in an article concerning
a loan securitization that was rated during the Report Period. In the article, an issuer referred to the fact that
many institutional buyers are limited to purchasing securities rated by one of the larger NRSROs, and that a
large NRSRO’s rating on the issue expanded the number of entities which could purchase the rated
securities. See Tracy Alloway, Peer-to-Peer Lender Wins Landmark Rating, Fin. Times, Jul. 10, 2014 at

impact on smaller NRSROs, while maintaining the usefulness of the information to users of
credit ratings.95
The Commission also adopted standards allowing NRSROs to tailor particular
requirements to their business models, size, and rating methodologies, which vary significantly
across NRSROs and potential NRSRO applicants. The Commission intended such rules to
provide flexibility to NRSROs to customize these standards, recognizing that NRSROs vary
significantly in the size and the scope of their activities.96 For example, the New NRSRO Rules
require each NRSRO to establish, maintain, document, and enforce standards of training,
experience, and competence for credit rating analysts.97 The standards of training must be
reasonably designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produces accurate ratings in
classes of ratings for which it is registered. Although an NRSRO is required to include certain
elements in its training standards and to consider certain enumerated factors in the design of such
standards, the rule provides flexibility to NRSROs to customize their standards as appropriate for
their business model, size, and rating methodologies.98
The New NRSRO Rules also include other provisions that may decrease the burden of
certain requirements on small NRSROs. For example, consistent with Section 15E(h)(3)(B)(i),
the Commission provided a mechanism for smaller NRSROs to apply for an exemption from
certain requirements relating to conflicts of interest.99
The Commission stated in the Adopting Release that the New NRSRO Rules enhancing
disclosure requirements and providing for the standardization of information may increase
competition by enabling smaller and newer NRSROs to attract attention to their rating
performance and methodologies, enhancing their ability to develop a reputation for producing
quality credit ratings.100 For a further discussion of these rules, see Sections V and VI of this
Report.

95

See Section VI of the Adopting Release. For example, the Commission modified the instructions for
Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO by narrowing the scope of credit ratings included in the performance statistics
for four of the five classes of credit ratings, which is expected to substantially reduce the amount of
historical information that an NRSRO is required to analyze. The Commission also modified Rule 17g7(a) by narrowing the scope of rating actions that will trigger the disclosure requirement, exempting certain
rating actions involving credit ratings assigned to foreign obligors or securities issued overseas, and
significantly reducing the reporting requirements relating to representations, warranties, and enforcement
mechanisms. These modifications from the Proposed Rules were described in the Adopting Release as
reducing the impact on small NRSROs. See Adopting Release, 79 FR at 55255-56.

96

In the Adopting Release, the Commission stated that the New NRSRO Rules are constructed to be
appropriate for NRSROs of all sizes. According to the Adopting Release, a number of the New NRSRO
Rules are policy and procedure-based requirements which allow NRSROs, including smaller NRSROs, to
comply with these requirements by tailoring and scaling their policies and procedures to their individual
sizes and business activities. See Adopting Release, 79 FR at 55253.

97

See Rule 17g-9. In the Adopting Release, the Commission noted that these requirements may increase the
level of competence and experience of the credit analysts employed by an NRSRO with possible positive
effects on the integrity and quality of credit ratings. See Adopting Release, 79 FR at 55092.

V.

TRANSPARENCY
A. Disclosure Requirements

Congress described the Rating Agency Act as an act to improve ratings quality “by
fostering accountability, transparency, and competition in the credit rating agency industry.”101
Section 932 of the Dodd-Frank Act is entitled “Enhanced regulation, accountability, and
transparency of NRSROs.” Both Acts contain various provisions designed to increase the
transparency—through clear disclosure open to public scrutiny—of, among other things,
NRSROs’ credit rating procedures and methodologies, business practices, and credit ratings
performance.
The New NRSRO Rules adopted during the Report Period improved and expanded the
disclosure requirements applicable to NRSROs. Additional sources of information that can be
beneficial to investors and others are now required to be made publicly available under
requirements of the New NRSRO Rules. These requirements are designed to enhance the
transparency of NRSRO credit ratings by reducing information asymmetries that may adversely
affect users of credit ratings.102 Specifically, the New NRSRO Rules require an NRSRO to
disclose:
(1) standardized performance statistics;103
(2) consolidated and increased information about credit rating histories;104
(3) information about material changes and significant errors in the procedures and
methodologies used to determine credit ratings;105
(4) information about specific rating actions;106 and
(5) clear definitions of each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the
NRSRO.107
An objective of these requirements is to improve the information provided to users of credit
ratings in order to facilitate external scrutiny of NRSRO activities, enable ratings users to make
more informed investment and credit-related decisions and allow users to compare the
performance of credit ratings by different NRSROs.108
The New NRSRO Rules amended the instructions to Exhibit 1 of Form NRSRO to
require a standard method for calculating and presenting performance statistics.109 The revised
instructions also require that the information for credit ratings of asset-backed securities be
presented on a more granular level than previously required. NRSROs must now disclose the

performance for various subclasses110 of asset-backed securities (rather than grouping all assetbacked securities ratings together in a single category), which is intended to provide more useful
information to users of credit ratings of those subclasses. The Commission noted in the
Adopting Release that the amendments to Exhibit 1 should result in performance statistics that
are more directly comparable across NRSROs.111
Additionally, the New NRSRO Rules also require NRSROs to use the EDGAR system to
file electronically with the Commission Form NRSRO and required exhibits to the form.112 On
August 3, 2015, the EDGAR system was updated to enable NRSROs to file Form NRSRO
through EDGAR. From that date forward, NRSROs are required to file their annual
certifications and updates to registration electronically using the EDGAR system, and the
Commission is to make such Form NRSRO filings publicly available on EDGAR upon
submission. These Form NRSRO submissions will remain available for reference even after
updated versions are submitted. Information filed using the EDGAR system will be publicly
available in a centralized online location, making the information easier for users of credit
ratings to access, search, and compare.113
The New NRSRO Rules enhance the disclosure requirements for credit rating histories so
that the histories will have a more complete scope and the information that must be disclosed
will be more robust. NRSROs are required to present this disclosure in a standardized XBRL
format as set forth in the Record of Credit Ratings Taxonomy, 2015 that was posted to the
Commission’s website on April 29, 2015.114
While the disclosure of performance statistics on Exhibit 1 of Form NRSRO provides an
overview of the performance of an NRSRO’s credit ratings in each class and subclass of credit
ratings, the disclosure of credit rating histories allows users of credit ratings to directly compare
the rating history of the same obligor or instrument across multiple NRSROs. The standardized
XBRL formatting requirements allow users of credit ratings to download, filter, and compare the
disclosures of each NRSRO. The objective of these enhancements is to make the disclosures
more useful in terms of the amount of information provided, the ability to search and sort the
information, and the ability to compare historical rating information across NRSROs.115
In accordance with the New NRSRO Rules, each NRSRO must now disclose certain
information in connection with each rating action it takes.116 Such information includes, among
other things, the version of the procedure or methodology used to determine the credit rating, a
description of the types of data that were relied upon for purposes of determining the credit
110

The required subclasses are residential mortgage backed securities, CMBS, collateralized loan obligations,
collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed commercial paper, other ABS, and other structured finance products.

rating, an assessment of the quality of information available and considered in determining the
credit rating, and information on the sensitivity of the credit ratings to assumptions made by the
NRSRO.117 These requirements are designed to promote transparency of the process for
determining credit rating actions, allowing users of credit ratings to better understand how credit
ratings are produced and the information content of credit ratings, including how these factors
vary across NRSROs.118
The New NRSRO Rules require an NRSRO to promptly publish information about
material changes to its procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings, the reason
for the changes, and the likelihood the changes will result in a change of existing credit
ratings.119 These disclosure requirements are designed to provide users of credit ratings with
additional information with which to assess the quality of a given NRSRO’s credit rating
processes.120 This new rule also requires an NRSRO to promptly publish notice of any
significant errors to such procedures and methodologies that may result in a change to current
credit ratings,121 further increasing the transparency of the NRSRO’s credit rating activities.
Under the New NRSRO Rules, each NRSRO must disclose on Form NRSRO a clear
definition of each symbol, number, or score it uses to denote a credit rating and must apply such
symbols, numbers, or scores consistently across all types of obligors and securities.122 This
requirement is designed to promote a better understanding of credit rating terminology and to
allow users of credit ratings to better compare the various credit ratings issued by a single
NRSRO, as well as credit ratings across NRSROs.123
B. Unsolicited Ratings and Commentaries
Beyond the disclosures required under Section 15E and the Commission’s rules,
transparency may be increased if NRSROs that are not hired to rate a security published their
views of the credit quality of such a security, such as by issuing an unsolicited rating or
publishing unsolicited commentaries. It is not uncommon for certain NRSROs to issue
unsolicited ratings in rating classes, outside of structured finance, where there is lower issuer
concentration, and where sufficient information is publicly available upon which to base a
rating.124 For structured finance transactions, however, much of the information on the
underlying assets necessary to produce a rating is not publicly available. Rule 17g-5(a)(3) was
intended to encourage the issuance of unsolicited ratings by NRSROs that are not hired to rate a
structured finance transaction by making the information necessary to rate such transactions

available to such NRSROs.125 However, no unsolicited initial ratings of structured finance
transactions have been produced in reliance on the information provided in the websites created
under such rule,126 and the rule contemplates that such information be used only for credit ratings
(and not for other types of publications, such as rating commentaries).
As mentioned in the Staff’s 2014 Annual Report, some NRSROs have published
unsolicited commentaries in which they express their viewpoints on particular securities, ratings,
or asset classes (including with respect to structured finance asset classes127). Several such
commentaries were issued over the course of the Report Period. For example, one larger
NRSRO published a report on the subprime auto sector, which highlighted some of the credit
risks associated with subprime auto transactions.128 The NRSRO stated that, because of these
risks, it did not view subprime auto deal tranches as worthy of the high ratings assigned to them
by other NRSROs. Additionally, two larger NRSROs published commentaries on CMBS
transactions in which they stated that the credit quality of loans in U.S. conduit/fusion CMBS
transactions has weakened.129 Both NRSROs also stated that some of the subordinate tranches of
these CMBS transactions which were not rated by these NRSROs were, in their opinions,
undercollateralized. These subordinate tranches received investment grade ratings from other
NRSROs.130 A larger NRSRO also published a commentary in which it criticized a rating on
Chinese ABS issued by another larger NRSRO.131

to Congress on Assigned Credit Ratings. See Report to Congress on Assigned Credit Ratings, Dec. 2012,

127

As noted above, information obtained pursuant to Rule 17g-5(a)(3) may not be used to produce commentaries.
Commentaries on specific structured finance transactions have largely been based on public information and/or
offering materials for the transaction. In other cases, NRSROs have produced commentaries that discuss a
structured finance asset class more generally, without commenting on a particular transaction.

Some of the smaller NRSROs have also published commentaries during the Report
Period. For example, one smaller NRSRO published a commentary on its views about certain
recent events in the CMBS sector.132 Another smaller NRSRO published a commentary
discussing the performance of banks during the financial crisis.133
Commentaries such as those mentioned above highlight differences in opinions and
ratings criteria among NRSROs, concerning matters such as the sufficiency of the credit
enhancement for the transactions. This type of information can serve to enhance investors’
understanding of the differences in ratings approaches used by the NRSROs.
VI.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

NRSROs operate under one of two business models (or a combination of them), and there
are potential conflicts of interest inherent in both. Most of the NRSROs, including the largest
NRSROs, operate under the “issuer-pay” model, which is subject to a potential conflict in that
the credit rating agency may be influenced to determine more favorable (i.e., higher) ratings than
warranted in order to retain the obligors or issuers as clients.134 This conflict could affect an
entire asset class if, for example, an NRSRO becomes known for issuing higher credit ratings
with respect to such class, resulting in that NRSRO’s retaining or attracting business from most
or all issuers of securities in such class.
The other business model is the “subscriber-pay” model which means that investors pay
the rating agency a subscription fee to access its ratings.135 This model is also subject to
potential conflicts of interest. For example, the NRSRO may be aware that an influential
subscriber holds a securities position (long or short) that could be advantaged if a credit rating
upgrade or downgrade causes the market value of the security to increase or decrease; or that the
subscriber invests in newly issued bonds and would obtain higher yields if the bonds were to
have lower ratings.

132

2014, available at: https://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/ResearchPapers/Structured-Credit-RatingsCommentary-Rating-Shopping.pdf.

See Large & Small Bank Performance During the Financial Crisis, Apr. 21, 2015, available at:
https://www.krollbondratings.com/show_report/2162.

134

For example, during the Report Period, the Department of Justice and 19 states and the District of Columbia
announced that they had entered into a settlement agreement with S&P to resolve certain allegations regarding
S&P’s ratings on MBS and collateralized debt obligations. One such allegation was that S&P falsely represented
that its ratings were objective, independent, and uninfluenced by S&P’s business relationships with the investment
banks that issued the securities. See Justice Department and State Partners Secure $1.375 Billion Settlement with
S&P for Defrauding Investors in the Lead Up to the Financial Crisis, Feb. 3, 2015, available at:
http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-state-partners-secure-1375-billion-settlement-spdefrauding-investors. In addition, the Commission announced a separate settlement agreement with S&P during
the Report Period. Among other things, the agreement settled charges that S&P loosened its CMBS rating criteria
to obtain more business but did not properly disclose the criteria changes to investors. See SEC Announces
Charges Against Standard & Poor’s for Fraudulent Ratings Misconduct, Release No. 2015-10 (Jan. 21, 2015),
available at: http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-10.html.

135

Under the “subscriber-pay” model, investors choosing not to subscribe might learn about credit ratings from
subscribers and other sources. This may be a reason for most of the NRSROs currently operating under the issuerpay business model.

32

Another example of a conflict in a “subscriber-pay” model is that the NRSRO may be
aware that a subscriber wishes to acquire a particular security but is prevented from doing so
because the credit rating of the security is lower than internal investment guidelines or an
applicable contract permit. An upgrade of the credit rating of the security by the NRSRO could
remove this impediment to investing in the security. These potential conflicts could be mitigated
to the extent that an NRSRO has a wide subscriber base and subscribers have different interests
with respect to an upgrade or downgrade of a particular security.
The potential for conflicts of interest involving an NRSRO may continue to be
particularly acute in structured finance products, where transactions are arranged by a relatively
concentrated group of sponsors, underwriters and managers, and rating fees are particularly
lucrative.136 Section 15E and the related Commission rules contain provisions addressing
conflicts of interest, applicable to both structured finance products and other types of rated
instruments and obligors.
The New NRSRO Rules supplemented and strengthened the prior existing rules related to
conflicts of interest. For example, the New NRSRO Rules:
(1) prohibit conflicts of interest relating to sales and marketing activities;137
(2) address conflicts of interest relating to employment of former analysts;138
(3) require, with respect to each rating action, disclosure of certain information related to
conflicts of interest and an attestation affirming the independence of such rating
action;139
(4) require each NRSRO to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal
controls;140 and
(5) provide that an NRSRO could have its registration suspended or revoked for violating
the rules governing conflicts of interest.141
These requirements are designed to promote the production of unbiased credit ratings and limit
the potential risk that users of credit ratings will make investment decisions using biased or
inaccurate information.142
The New NRSRO Rules prohibit an NRSRO from issuing or maintaining a credit rating
where a person within the NRSRO who participates in determining or monitoring the credit
rating, or developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for determining the credit
rating, also participates in sales or marketing activities, or is influenced by sales or marketing
considerations.143 This absolute prohibition is intended to isolate the analytical function,
136

A Senate Report related to the Dodd-Frank Act noted, for instance, that conflicts of interest in the process
of rating structured financial products contributed to the issuance of inaccurate ratings by rating agencies
and accordingly to the mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and investors. See S. Report No.
111-176 (2010).

including the development of the procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings,
from sales and marketing considerations within an NRSRO, in order to promote the integrity and
quality of an NRSRO’s credit ratings.144
In instances in which a conflict of interest relating to a future prospect of employment of
an analyst influenced a credit rating, the New NRSRO Rules require an NRSRO to have policies
and procedures to promptly determine whether a credit rating must be revised and promptly
publish a revised credit rating or an affirmation of the credit rating, along with certain
disclosures about the existence of the conflict.145 This new rule enhances the related
requirements set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act146 by requiring the NRSRO to act promptly and to
disclose information about the conflict of interest. The Commission noted in the Adopting
Release that these new requirements will provide users of credit ratings with information to
assess an NRSRO’s ability to address conflicts of interest and to compare NRSROs with respect
to their ability to manage the conflicts.147
The New NRSRO Rules also prescribe certain factors that an NRSRO must consider with
respect to its internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to
policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings148 and require each
NRSRO to submit to the Commission an annual report, certified by its CEO, containing an
assessment by management of the effectiveness of, and identifying any material weaknesses
identified in, such internal control structure.149 The Commission observed in the Adopting
Release that the exercise of considering the factors identified in the New NRSRO Rules will
provide NRSROs with an opportunity to critically evaluate their existing internal control
structures and should improve the overall effectiveness of these internal controls.150 Further, the
requirement to file and certify an internal controls report could provide accountability and
increase the likelihood that NRSROs will adhere to their procedures and methodologies for
determining credit ratings, thereby improving the integrity of credit ratings.151
Under the New NRSRO Rules, an NRSRO must disclose, when taking a rating action,
information relating to conflicts of interest of the NRSRO and provide an attestation that the
credit rating was not influenced by any other business activities, was based solely upon the
merits of the instruments being rated, and was an independent evaluation of the credit risk of the
instrument.152 The Commission noted in the Adopting Release that the individual providing the

attestation will be incentivized to take steps to verify the truth thereof, thus promoting analytical
independence.153
Finally, the New NRSRO Rules provide that an NRSRO could have its registration
suspended or revoked for violating the rules governing conflicts of interest if the violation
affected a credit rating and suspension or revocation is necessary for the protection of investors
and in the public interest.154 One objective of this new provision is to allow for suspension or
revocation of an NRSRO for conflict of interest violations that are not willful.155
VII. CONCLUSION
The Staff will continue to conduct its oversight function with respect to NRSROs,
including the performance of Staff examinations, and engage in other initiatives with respect to
NRSROs.

revocation of a credit rating agency’s registration as an NRSRO.
