FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
WASHINGTON,

D. C.

INTRODUCTION
The Securities and Exchange Commission is required, pursuant to
the provisions of Section 23 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Section 23 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, to submit annually a report to the Congress covering the work
of the Commission for the preceding year and such information,
data, and recommendations for further legislation as it may find
advisable. The following report, made pursuant to such provisions,
covers the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938.
The Securities and Exchange Commission was created under its
organic Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, approved June 6,
1934, for the purpose of administering this Act and the Securities
Act of 1933.1 The Congress next passed the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, which Act became effective on August 26,1935.
So that during the fiscal years 1936 and 1937 the Commission had
three major legislative enactments under its jurisdiction. Through
the passage of Public No. 621, 74th Congress, approved May 27,
1936, the Congress further strengthened certain provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by amending, in addition to other
sections, Section 15 thereof, relating to over-the-counter markets.
This constituted in brief the status of legislation falling within the
jurisdiction of the Commission as of June 30, 1937.
During the closing days of the last session of the 75th Congress,
new legislation was passed which placed additional responsibilities
and duties upon this Commission. This new legislation comprises
the following:
(1) The Maloney Act (Public No. 719, 75th Congress)
approved by the President on June 25,1938. This Act amends
certain sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, relating to the regulation of the over-the-counter markets and
imposes new duties upon the Commission with respect thereto.
In brief, this amendment provides for a system of regulation
in the over-the-counter markets through the formation of
1 Sections 201 to 209 of Title II of the Scenrities Exchsnge Act of 1934amended and repealed certain provisions of the Scenrities Actof1933. A further, but very slight, amendment was made on August II, 1935,
In the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

REGISTRATION OF PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANffiS

An outstanding event of the past fiscal year was the decision by the
Supreme Court of the United States upholding the constitutionality
of the registration provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935.11
On the day the above-mentioned decision was rendered, several of
the larger unregistered holding companies filed notification of registration. With a few exceptions, the remainder of the industry subject
to the Act and unregistered filed their notifications as rapidly thereafter
as the forms could be completed and forwarded to the Commission.
Registration under the provisions of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 is accomplished by the public utility holding
company filing with the Commission a notification of registration
(Form U-5A) and, within a prescribed time, a registration statement
(Form U-5B). The Commission's report for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1937, described in some detail the information required to be
furnished on Form U-5B; An analysis of the completed forms now
on file has shown a wealth of information not heretofore available.
This information has been and will continue to be of great assistance
to the public and to the Commission in the discharge of its duties.
As a result of experience, the Commission, on May 17, 1938, promulgated an amended Form U-5B (registration statement).
The
amendments to this form made no changes of substance. They were
designed to produce greater precision, clarity, and simplification in
the presentation of the data required. The important changes in
this amended form included requirements as to additional information
relating to the surplus accounts of system companies and to the original cost of securities acquired by system companies.
The Commission also, on May 17, 1938, promulgated Form U-5S,
which is an annual supplement to the Form U-5B registration statement. The purpose of this new form is to keep the information
contained in the registration statement current and up to date.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, 36 public utility holding company systems had registered under the Act containing altogether 86
registered holding companies. At the close of the year, 55 public
utility holding company systems had registered containing 139
registered holding companies. This represents during the year an
approximate increase of 215 percent in the value of holding company
system assets registered under the Act.
The 55 registered public utility holding company systems as of
June 30, 1938, together with an indication of their approximate consolidated assets as of December 31,1937, are identified in the following
table:

ORDERS
GRANTING
EXEMPTIONS
FROM REGISTRATION
UNDER
THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

Under the provisions of Sections 2 and 3 of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, authority is granted to the Commission to exempt by order certain types of companies from the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed by that ActY The requirements
as to the various kinds of applications for exemption under these
sections are extremely flexible.
The form such exemptions may take varies considerably, that is,
among other things, (1) a company may be declared not a "holding
company" as that term is defined in Section 2 (a) (7) of the Act; (2)
not to be a subsidiary of a specified holding company pursuant to
Section 2 (a) (8); or (3) a holding company may be exempted from
the registration requirements if it falls within one of the categories
specified in Section 3 (a). The Commission is also empowered by
the provisions of Section 3 (b) to exempt certain subsidiaries of
registered holding companies from such provisions of the Act which
it finds proper if such subsidiaries carry on their business wholly in
foreign countries.
However, before the Commission acts on any application for exemption, public hearings are held at which any interested member of
the public or a representative of a State public utility commission
may appear and take part in the proceedings. In granting any of
these exemptions, the Commission is directed by the Act to impose
such conditions as may be necessary to protect the public interest or
the interest of investors or consumers.
The following statistics indicate the number of applications for
exemption received, granted, withdrawn, and pending at the close of
the fiscal year:
" The Oommisslon's powers to exempt by rule are not discussed in this section.

REORGANIZATION,
SIMPLIFICATION,
TERED PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING

AND INTEGRATION OF REGISCOMPANIES AND SUBSIDIARIES

Section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act imposes
upon the Commission the duty of passing upon all plans, whether voluntary or involuntary, for the reorganization of registered holding
companies or their subsidiaries, and the duty of requiring the corporate simplification and geographical integration of public utility holding company systems.
Subparagraph (1) of Section 11 (b) of the Act provides that it shall
be the duty of the Commission to require by order each registered
holding company and subsidiary to take such action as the Commission shall find necessary to limit the operations of the holding company
system of which such company is a part to a single integrated public
utility system and to such other businesses as are reasonably incidental
or economically necessary to the operations of such integrated public
utility system. The Commission may, however, permit a registered
holding company to control more than one integrated public utility
system if it finds that each additional system cannot be operated as
an independent system without the loss of substantial economies,
that each is located in one or adjoining states, and that the combination of such systems under the control of a single holding company
is not so large as to impair the advantages of localized management.
Subparagraph (2) of Section 11 (b) provides that it shall be the duty
of the Commission to require by order that each registered holding
company and subsidiary take such steps as the Commission shall find
necessary to insure that the corporate structure and continued existence of each company in the holding company system does not unduly
or unnecessarily complicate the structure or unfairly or inequitably
distribute voting power among stockholders in the holding company
system. More particularly, the Commission's order shall require that
each holding company shall cease to be a holding company with respect
to any subsidiary which itself has a subsidiary which is a holding company. Both subparagraphs of this section are to be effectuated as
soon as practicable after January 1, 1938.
Section 11 (e) provides an alternative method for complying with
these standards established in Section 11 (b). Under Section 11 (e)

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Any registered holding company or subsidiary may submit a plan
to the Commission for the divestment of control, securities, or other

assets, or for other action by such company or any subsidiary for the
purpose of enabling it or any subsidiary to comply with the provisions
of Section 11 (b). If, after hearing, the Commission shall find such
plan necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 11 (b) and fair
and equitable to the persons affected by the plan, the Commission
shall make an order approving the plan:
It will be realized that the problem of conforming the electric and
gas utilities to the requirements of Section 11 (b) is a task of great
magnitude. Its most expeditious accomplishment turns upon the
willingness of the industry voluntarily to take the necessary steps."
The Commission's policy has been and is to give each holding company every reasonable opportunity to effectuate the Section 11 (b)
programs by voluntary proceedings, and to institute involuntary proceedings under Section 11 (b) only as a last resort or where the exigencies of special situations make such a course desirable or necessary.
By June 30, 1938, relatively few plans for compliance with Section
11 (b) had been submitted to the Commission. It had not at that
date instituted any involuntary proceedings. But in this connection
it should be recalled that only part of the industry was operating under
the statute prior to the Supreme Court decision in the Electric Bond
and Share case on March 28, 1938, and that Section 11 (b) did not
become mandatory until January 1, 1938. But a sound commencement and real progress were made in the Section 11 (b) program. In
that connection the following three cases, however, will be of interest:
American

Water Works and Electric Company,

Incorporated

On December 30, 1937, the Commission approved, with certain
modifications, the first major plan of corporate simplification filed
pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 (e). This concerned the
application of American Water Works and Electric Company, Incorporated. This company controls, through the medium of The West
Penn Electric Company, an intermediate holding company, stocks in
public utility and holding companies whose electric operations extend
over an area covering portions of the States of Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, and Virginia. The area extends, roughly,
300 miles north and south and 300 miles east and west. The assets
of American Water Works and Electric system on a consolidated
basis amount to approximately $455,189,065 and its annual con11On May 5, 1938,1'Committee of Holding Company Exeeutlves was chosen by 14major utility systems

under the PUblic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. On August 3, 1938,Chairman Douglas addressed
a letter to the heads of all registered holding companies requesting the various systems to present, not later
than December I, 1938, tentative suggestions and programs looking toward compliance with Sections

-solidated earnings amount to approximately $58,868,968 (both as of
December 31, 1937).14
In addition to its electric operations and a small amount of gas
.service, subsidiaries of American Water Works and Electric Company.
Incorporated, are engaged in a number of other businesses which do
-
not constitute public utility enterprises within the meaning of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. These include water
'works, coal appliance sales, electric railway and bus transportation.
. and bridges, agriculture, and certain other minor operations.
The plan submitted by the applicant contemplated, by process 01
.dissolution, merger and re-alignment, the elimination of several
"second-degree" holding company relationships, the continuance of
- which is forbidden under the terms of Section 11 (b) (2) of the statute.
No change in the actual physical utility properties of the applicant
was involved inasmuch as the company contended and the Commission
.found that the operations of its electric and gas utility subsidiaries
-were limited to a single integrated public utility system.
The Commission found that the retention by American Water
Works and Electric Company, Incorporated, of its water properties
(other than those controlled through American Communities Company) and its coal and appliance businesses were reasonably incidental
and economically appropriate to the operation of its integrated public
utility system.
The Commission reserved its decision with respect to the applicant's
retention of its interest in American Communities Company system
to afford an opportunity to effectuate the elimination of American
-'Communities Company as an intermediate company, and the recapitalization or reorganization of its system, and an increase of applicant's equity therein.
The Commission found that the applicant's interests in its agricultural properties in California were not reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropriate to its utility operations, and gave
the applicant a reasonable period of time to dispose of these interests.
The Commission found that the distribution of voting power in the
. applicant and its subsidiaries, especially in the event of non-payment
. of preferred stock dividends, was not fair and equitable. The appli. cant was given a reasonable period of time to effect appropriate
-changes in that respect.
Finally the Commission found that upon consummation of the simplification plan, the corporate structure of the American Water Works
and Electric system, except as relates to the distribution of voting
power and subject to approval of a plan to simplify and reorganize the
American Communities Company system and to increase applicant's
~
equity therein, would conform to the requirements of Section 11 (b) (2).
.. These figures were obtained from the annual report of American Water Works and Electric Company,

=: Inc., to Its stockholders for the year ended December 31, 1937.

Utdities Associates

The second voluntary simplification plan was filed by Massachusetts
Utilities Associates, a registered holding company and a subsidiary of
New England Power Association. Under the plan, Massachusetts
Utilities Associates was to absorb three of its direct subsidiary subholding companies, Massachusetts Lighting Companies, Central
Massachusetts Light & Power Company, and Commonwealth Gas &
Electric Companies. Upon consummation of the plan the 16 utility
subsidiaries of these 3 sub-holding companies would become direct
subsidiaries of Massachusetts Utilities Associates. This plan was
approved by the Commission on January 11, 1938.
Penn Western Gas and Electric Company

Penn Western Gas and Electric Company is a registered holding
company whose assets consisted principally of common stocks of the
following subsidiaries:
(1) Pennsylvania Gas & Electric Corporation, a registered holding
company which has 16 subsidiaries engaged in the manufactured and
natural gas business in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Virginia. (Applicant owned 100% of the Class B
common stock.)
(2) American Railways Corporation, a non-utility holding company
with one subsidiary, which supplies transportation service in Dayton,
Ohio. (Applicant owned 100% of the common stock.)
(3) Iowa Public Service Company, which is primarily an electric
and gas utility company, serving the central and western portion of
Iowa. It is also a registered holding company. (Applicant owns
42.3 % of the common stock and the balance is owned by Sioux City
Gas and Electric Company.)
(4) Sioux City Gas and Electric Company, which is primarily an
electric and gas utility company serving Sioux City, Iowa. It is also
a registered holding company. (Applicant owns 87.5% of the common stock and the balance is owned by Iowa Public Service Company.)
The application of Penn Western Gas and Electric Company
proposed a partial liquidating dividend to applicant's common stockholders of its holdings in Pennsylvania Gas and Electric Corporation,
American Railways Corporation and Iowa Public Service Company.
This divestment would leave Penn WesteJV with but one direct
subsidiary, namely, Sioux City Gas and Electric Company.
Severance of the "Eastern" holding company system, namely,
Pennsylvania Gas and Electric Corporation, from the "Western"
holdings of the system would be a distinct step toward meeting the
requirements of Section 11. In addition, the applicant satisfied the
Commission that it intends, within a reasonable period of time, to
eliminate certain inter-company holdings which now complicate the

system and then to distribute the balance of its holdings, including the
stock of Sioux City Gas and Electric Company, to its own stockholders, and that, thereupon, Penn Western Gas and Electric Company will be dissolved. Accordingly, the Commission approved the
application on March 30, 1938.
Including the 3 cases noted above, there have been filed 24 applications during the fiscal year dealing with plans for the reorganization
and simplification of 16 holding company systems. As of June 30,
1937, there were 3 such applications pending. Of the total 27 applications, the Commission disposed of 7 and 20 were pending as of June
30,1938. The total approximate consolidated assets affected by these
plans amounted to $4,213,655,479.

As was the case in the year ended June 30, 1937, a very large
proportion of the security issues covered securities which were issued
for the purpose of refunding outstanding securities by issuance of
other securities having lower interest or dividend rates. In many

HOLDING

On October 21, 1937, the Commission adopted Form U-14-3 for
use by registered holding companies in filing annual reports of financial
condition and results of operations. The information required in the
annual report form is based upon the Uniform System of Accounts
for Public Utility Holding Companies promulgated by the Commission
August 8, 1936, and made effective as of January 1, 1937. These
annual reports cover the calendar' year and are required to be filed
with the Commission on or before May 1 of each year. The first

18

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of such reports cover the calendar year 1937 and permit for the first
time accurate current comparisons of financial data pertaining to
different holding companies.
The requirements of the form include certain questions designed to
give historical data concerning the companies, including date and
state of incorporation or organization and information concerning
consolidations, mergers, or reorganizations to which the company
has been a party; a list of the directors and of the managing officers as
of the close of the year; finanoial statements, including a comparative
balance sheet showing the financial condition of the company as of
the beginning of the year (or period) and as of the close of the year,
an income account showing the results of operation during the period
between balance sheet dates and a statement of surplus showing the
changes therein during the same period of time. This form also provides for numerous schedules calling for additional information concerning items included in the principal balance sheet, and income,
expense, and surplus accounts.
Among these are a schedule calling
for a detailed analysis of investments at the close of the year, together
with information with respect to investments acquired or disposed of
during the year, and a schedule for a report of the dividend and
interest revenues in detail.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938, 54 annual reports of
public utility holding companies were received.
SERVICE COMPANIES

'Section 13 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 is
designed, in major part, to regulate the performance of services, sales,
and construction by companies in a holding company system for companies within the system. Broadly speaking, the Act permits such
intra-system services to be performed only at cost and subject to such
limitations as the Commission finds appropriate in the public interest.
With certain exceptions, therefore, the Act, and the rules adopted
under this section, provide that services be performed, if performed
by a company within the system, by a company whose methods of
Tendering services and calculating costs have been approved by the
Commission.
The Commission, during the past year, received 6
applications for approval of mutual service companies and 12 applications for approval of subsidiary service companies.
One application
for approval of a subsidiary service company, pending on July 1, 1937,
was withdrawn during the course of the past year. Of the 6 applications for approval of mutual service companies, all of them were
pending at the close of the year, while of the 12 applications for
approval of subsidiary service companies, 2 were approved, 1 was
withdrawn, and 9 were pending
of June 30, 1938.

Mutual service companies and subsidiary service companies, the

required to file annual reports (Form U-13-60) with the Commission
-on or before April 1 of each year for the prior calendar year. These
annual reports are based upon the Uniform System of Accounts for

Exchange Reorganization

During the past fiscal year, material progress has been made toward
the attainment of one of the Commission's vital objectives, namely,
the adequate supervision of national securities exchanges. The Commission has consistently advocated such regulation by the exchanges
themselves that the Commission need only exercise a residual control or supervision. It had long been apparent, however, that serious.
defects in the organization of many exchanges had hindered their
effective assumption of this degree of responsibility for the conduct
of their business. Efforts were being made, however, by groups of
members of certain exchanges to replace the cumbersome administrative mechanism with organizations that were adapted to current
needs. To these efforts the Commission gave its encouragement.
In connection with this matter, conferences between representatives
of the New York Stock Exchange and the Commission were held
during the latter part of the year 1937. During these conferences
various plans were discussed, but no agreement as to an adequate
solution could be reached. Therefore, on November 23, 1937, the
Commission, through its Chairman, publicly requested the New York
Stock Exchange to proceed at once to work out a satisfactory plan of
reorganization in order that the needs of efficient management of an
important public institution might be satisfied. In compliance with
this request, the Exchange appointed an independent committee to
study and report on the need for such a reorganization. This Committee, headed by Carle C. Conway, Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Continental Can Company, immediately instituted
studies and on January 27, 1938, submitted an outstanding report to
the Exchange. This report recognized the fact that national securitiesexchanges are public institutions impressed with a public trust, and
provided a plan for a modern administrative organization to supplant
the old outmoded one. On March 17,1938, the Exchange, in order to
effectuate the principal recommendations contained in this report,
voted to adopt a radically revised constitution. On May 16, 1938,
that constitution became effective and the newly elected Exchange
administration assumed office. William McC. Martin, Jr., was elected
President on June 30, 1938.
The reorganization of the New York Stock Exchange provides for
direct representation of the public on the Board of Governors and in11 On July 9,1938, the Oommisslon adopted two forms, namely, Form U-12 (I)-A and Form U-12 (I)-B, in
lieu of the old Form U-12 (i)-I. These forms bPcame effective on August I, 1938.

creased representation of Exchange firms doing business with the
public. Further results of this reorganization are as follows: The administrative structure has been greatly simplified; the number of
standing committees was reduced from 17 to 7; the President of the
Exchange is a salaried individual and may not be a member of the
Exchange; and executive staffs have been created to carry out, under
the direction of the President of the Exchange, the administrative
functions formerly conducted by the Governors sitting as committee
members.
The process of exchange reorganization has not been limited to
the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, on March 31, 1938,
the Chicago Stock Exchange, after long and careful study, effected
a revision of its constitution to provide a form of administrative
organization more in keeping with the modern, progressive concept
of a stock exchange. Also, the New York Curb Exchange appointed
a committee to study its organizational problems and to make recommendations in regard thereto. At the end of the past fiscal year this
committee had not as yet made public its findings and recornmendations." On February 15, 1938, the Detroit Stock Exchange materially amended its constitution and rules in order to effect changes in
its existing procedure and practice.
Round Table Conferences

An outgrowth of the reorganization of the New York Stock Exchange
has been the creation of a mechanism for the discussion and disposition of various problems in which both the Commission and the Exchange are interested. Round table conferences, first proposed by
the Commission's Chairman, were inaugurated on June 3, 1938.
At the first meeting the Chairman, in setting forth the agenda for the
conferences, named five principal subjects for future exploration,
namely, a trust institution to perform the banking and custodial
functions of brokers; the problems of trading on the floor, including
aspects of segregation of the broker-dealer functions as respects the
specialist and the floor trader; the quality and quantity of bond trading on the Exchange; the conduct of business in odd lots; and a
comprehensive examination of commission rates for transactions in
securities on the Exchange. A second meeting was held on June 9,
1938, and during subsequent months these discussions have become
a regular practice. The Exchange has appointed a special committee
to represent it in the meetings and the Commission has been represented by some of its members as well as by staff officials. Prior

to the end of the past fiscal year, no definite results of these confer-.
ences were announced inasmuch as the program with the new management had been so recently undertaken. However, material progresswas made toward working out financial safeguards for customers'
property 19 and toward studying the marked decline which had taken
place during recent years in bond trading on exchanges. Further
consideration of the segregation problem, as well as other subjects,
also was under continued discussion.
Exchanges Registered

In addition to the major revision in exchange reorganization,
many changes in exchange rules and practices were also made. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938, more than 250 amendments
were filed by registered exchanges in connection with their applications for registration, which amendments were examined for the
purpose of ascertaining compliance with the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the Commission. Furthermore, studies have been made of the organization, rules, trading
practices, listing procedure and personnel of seven national securities
exchanges and one exempted exchange. The exchanges which were
so examined are listed below:
Chicago Board of Trade
Los Angeles Stock Exchange
Philadelphia Stock Exchange
San Francisco Curb Exchange
San Francisco Mining Exchange
San Francisco Stock Exchange
Seattle Stock Exchange
Standard Stock Exchange of Spokane

At the time of the examination of the San Francisco Curb Exchange
and the San Francisco Stock Exchange, negotiations had already been
undertaken for a merger of the two institutions.
Commission representatives assisted in the ensuing conferences and, on April 15, 1938,
the San Francisco Curb Exchange applied to the Commission for
permission to withdraw its registration as a national securities exchange
in pursuance of a plan for its dissolution and consolidation with
the San Francisco Stock Exchange. In its application, the San
Francisco Curb Exchange declared that its reasons for seeking the
withdrawal of its registration were (1) that the Exchange had been
formed primarily for the purpose of providing a market for unlisted
stocks and that this field had become materially restricted during the
past 4 years with a gradual reduction in the number of issues enjoying
.. On October 31, 1938,the CommissIon and the New York Stock Exchanl(e announced the results to that
date of these conferences In the form of a JoInt program designed to prevent the repentton of certain abuses
and lax praetiees and to provide certain protective assurances to customers through the establishment oC
more stringent requirements respecting financial responslbillty of brokers and dealers. See Report oC

unlisted trading privileges on the Exchange; (2) that approximately
78 percent of its members were members of or affiliated with member
firms of the San Francisco Stock Exchange, the facilities of which
were considered sufficient for the volume of trading experienced in
the region during the past several years; and (3) that, under conditions
then existing, it was believed that the dissolution of the San Francisco
Curb Exchange and the absorption of its trading privileges by the
San Francisco Stock Exchange would result in a continuance of market
facilities on an improved basis and would stimulate the growth of
the San Francisco Stock Exchange as a regional exchange to the ultimate benefit of the general public and industry in the region of the
Exchange. On April 21, 1938, the Commission issued an order granting the application of the San Francisco Curb Exchange to withdraw
its registration as a national securities exchange. Pursuant to Rule
JF7 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges on. the San Francisco Curb Exchange were transferred to the
San Francisco Stock Exchange for trading thereon as securities
admitted to unlisted trading privileges.
On February 26, 1938, the Commission issued an order granting
the application of the Chicago Curb Exchange for the withdrawal
of its registration as a national securities exchange. This application
cited as reasons for withdrawal the facts that its membership had
substantially declined, that it had operated at a large deficit for the
past 4 years and that the volume of its listings and transactions Wf!A
insufficient to warrant continued operation.
The Buffalo Stock Exchange, which had been permitted to withdraw its registration as a national securities exchange with leave to
apply for reinstatement, originally before April 1, 1937, and subsequently before April 30, 1938, again requested and received a further
extension of time until June 30, 1938, within which it might apply for
reinstatement as a national securities exchange. As of June 30,1938,
the Buffalo Stock Exchange had made no application for reinstatement.

Applications for Registration of Securities on Exchanges

Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, financial and other
pertinent factual data had been made available to the public with
respect to 2,485 companies having securities listed and registered on
national securities exchanges. These registrants include most of the
leading nationally known companies in the United States as well as
many with activities of a sectional or local character.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that a company seeking such registration of its securities must file an application on the
appropriate form prescribed by the Commission, which application
must contain detailed financial data, including schedules breaking
down the more significant accounts reflected therein. In general, the
financial data thus required include, among others, such items of vital
interest to investors as sales, cost of goods sold, and inventories.
The application must also reveal pertinent information concerning the
history of the company, its capital structure and that of its affiliates,
the full terms of its securities, warrants, rights, and options, the control
and management of its affairs, and the remuneration of its officers
and directors.
Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the General Rules
and Regulations promulgated thereunder, each of the 2,485 companies
with securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges
also has the duty to file within 120 days after the close of its fiscal
year, with the Commission and the exchange, an annual report bringing up to date the financial and other more important items of information contained in its application for registration of securities. In

FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

25

addition, each must also file a current report for any calendar month
during the interim in the event certain material changes occur in its
affairs.
All of these 2,485 applications and several thousand supplementary
annual and current reports have been examined by the Commission
to determine whether they furnish adequate disclosure of information
required by the Act and the rules and regulations pertaining thereto.
Where deficiencies are discovered as a result of the examination, the
registrant is required to file correcting amendments, which in turn are
examined as to their sufficiency in the same manner as the original
application or report.
Certain information is also required to be filed by companies whose
securities are listed on the seven exchanges which are exempted from
registration pursuant to the Act.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, proceedings were pending under
Section 19 (a) (2) of the Act to determine whether to suspend for a
period not exceeding 12 months or to withdraw the registration of
securities of three companies, which securities were listed on national
securities exchanges. During the year, similar proceedings were instituted with respect to securities of 11 additional companies. This
action was based upon the failure of these registrants to comply with
Sections 12 or 13 20 of the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations thereunder. Eleven of these proceedings were disposed of,
four by dismissal and seven by orders of the Commission withdrawing
the registration; and three were still pending at the close of the year.
The Commission made effective as of January 3, 1938, revised rules
and forms governing the registration of certain securities for "when
issued" trading on exchanges." This revision consisted in general of
the clarification and simplification of rules and forms previously used
in connection with such securities. The two changes of most significance as a practical matter were:
(1) Under the old rules, "when issued" trading was limited

to the exchange where the security to be issued wonld ultimately be traded. Under the new rules, "when issued" trading
is also possible on the' exchange where the seourity bearing the
warrant or right is listed. A similar change has been made
with respect to trading in issued warrants,
10 Section 12of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934requires the registration of all securities which are
listed on a national securities exchange, unless such securities are specifically exempted from registration by
the Act or by the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Section 13provides that the Information
contained in the application for registration filed under Section 12shall be kept reasonably current In accord.
ance with the rules and regulations of the Commission.
II The old rules JD4 to JD12, Inclusive, were changed Into one rule designated JD4.
Forms I-J and 2-J
were revised and continued under the same designations; Form 4-J was revised and designated Form 15AN;
and amendment Forms 3-J and 5-J were dlsconttnued and In lieu thereof the standard amendment Form 8
was made applicable for amendments to Forms I-I, 2-1, and 15AN,

Pursuant to Rule JD2 (b), 64 applications were filed with the Commission during the past year for the withdrawal or striking from
listing and registration of securities fully listed and registered on na.tional securities exchanges. As of June 30, 1937,22 such applications
were pending. Of this combined total, 65 were granted and 21 were
pending as of June 30, 1938.
Pursuant to Rule JD3 (a), the Commission received 226 certifications from exchanges stating that securities fully listed and registered
thereon had been paid, redeemed, or retired in full.

Ru1e JF2 (a) permits unlisted trading privileges on a national
securities exchange to continue in a security where minor changes

FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

have occurred therein, such as changes in the title, the interest rate,
the par value, amount outstanding, etc. The rule provides that
exchanges shall notify the Commission of any such changes promptly
after learning thereof. During the fiscal year ended June ?Q, .1938,
the Commission received 739 such notifications.
If more substantial changes are made in securities, an application
must be filed by the exchange in support of the contention that the
altered security is substantially equivalent to the security admitted
to unlisted trading privileges thereon. The application must be
approved by the Commission before the altered security may be
traded in lieu of the original security. Subsection (b) of Rule JF2
prescribes the information to be contained in such application.
During the fiscal year in question, 22 applications were received by the
Commission, of which 14 were granted and 8 were denied.
Clause 2 of Section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended on May 27, 1936, provides that the Commission, upon
application by a national securities exchange, and upon conforming
with certain standards, may extend unlisted trading privileges to
securities duly listed and registered on another national securities
exchange. As of June 30, 1937, 45 such applications were pending.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938,26 additional applications
were filed. Of these 71 applications, 37 were granted, 7 were denied,
5 were withdrawn, the Commission reserved decision in connection
with 1 application, and 21 were pending as of June 30, 1938.
The amended Section 12 (f) also permits the Commission, upon
application by a national securities exchange, to extend unlisted
trading privileges to securities in respect of which there is available,
from a registration statement and periodical reports or other data
filed pursuant to the rules or regulations of the Commission adopted
under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, information substantially equivalent to that required in respect
of a security duly listed and registered on a national securities exchange.
As of June 30, 1937,22 such applications were pending. During the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1938, 4 additional applications were filed.
Of these 26 applications, 12 were granted, 6 were denied, 4 were
withdrawn and 4 were pending as of June 30, 1938.
As of June 30, 1937, there were pending before the Commission two
applications by a broker or dealer for the termination of unlisted trading privileges on the New York Curb Exchange. These applications
were granted during the fiscal year. An application by an issuer for
the termination of unlisted trading privileges in its common stock on
the same exchange was filed on June 24, 1938, and was pending at the
close of the fiscal year.
During the past year, the Commission was notified, pursuant to
Rule JF3 (c), of the removal from unlisted trading privileges of 360

32

COMMISSION

securities. Of this number, 14 were removed when the registration
of the Chicago Curb Exchange was withdrawn on March 15, 1938,
and 166 were removed when the registration of the San Francisco
Curb Exchange was withdrawn on April 30, 1938.
When the San Francisco Stock Exchange absorbed the San Francisco Curb Exchange on April 30, 1938, the Commission amended its
Rule JF7 so as to permit an exchange which has absorbed another
exchange in the same metropolitan area to continue unlisted trading
privileges in those securities which enjoyed unlisted trading privileges
on the other exchange at the time of the absorption. The 166 securities which had theretofore been admitted to such privileges on
the San Francisco Curb Exchange were accordingly transferred to the
San Francisco Stock Exchange.
As of June 30, 1938, 13 national securities exchanges and 3 exempted
exchanges permitted trading in securities on an unlisted basis. Of
the 13 registered exchanges, 5 permitted trading in both stocks and
bonds on an unlisted basis and the other 8 exchanges in stocks only.
As of June 30, 1938, 1,223 stock and 496 bond issues were admitted to
unlisted trading privileges on the 13 registered exchanges. The
combined total represented 1,719 securities 23 against a total of 1,883
securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges on June 30, 1937.
Thus, during the year there was a net decline of 164 securities so
admitted.
There are three exempted exchanges upon which securities are
admitted to unlisted trading privileges. As of June 30, 1938, 153
stock and 14 bond issues were admitted to unlisted trading privileges
on these exchanges. The combined total represented 167 securities,"
compared with 164 at the end of the previous year.

OVER-THE-COUNTER

MARKETS

and Rules Thereunder

During the past fiscal year, the work of the Commission in the overthe-counter securities markets has been signalized by the inauguration
of a comprehensive program for administering and supervising this
important branch of the securities business. This program had its
origin several years ago in a cooperative endeavor of the Commission
and various voluntary associations of brokers and dealers, particularly the Investment Bankers Conference, Inc., to improve the
standards of practice prevailing in the business. The program is
based upon a bill introduced in the Senate by Senator Francis T.
Maloney, of Connecticut, who availed himself, inter alia, of material
accumulated by the Commission in the intensive studies it had conducted and of the conclusions which had been reached in the frequent

FOURTH

round table conferences between the Commission and representatives
of the various groups of investment bankers, dealers, and brokers.
Representatives of the Commission appeared in support of the bill at
hearings before the Committee on Banking and Currency of the Senate
and a subcommittee of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce of the House of Representatives.
After some amendment,
this bill was passed by the Congress as Public No. 719, 75th Congress,
and was approved by the President on June 25, 1938.
The new legislation follows the principle of conferring upon regulatory groups from business a primary responsibility for enforcing high
standards of business conduct upon their members. In part, it
amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by inserting after Section
15 of the Act a new Section 15A. In its essentials, the new section
sets up a system of regulation in the over-the-counter markets through
the formation of voluntary associations of investment bankers, dealers
and brokers doing business in these markets under appropriate Governmental supervision. This system is designed to provide investors
in the over-the-counter markets with protection comparable to that
provided by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to
national securities exchanges and is, patterned upon the control of
exchanges provided in that Act.
'
Prior to passage of Public No. 719, 75th Congress, known as
the "Maloney Act", the Commission drafted an extensive set of
rules under Sections 15 (c), 10 (b), 17 (a), and 23 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as a result of study and research into
over-the-counter trading practices. These rules, defining practices
which are manipulative, deceptive, ~
or fraudulent in the over-thecounter markets were adopted by the Commission and became
effective on October 1, 1937, as Rules MCI through MC8 and GB2,
GB3, and OAl. Rule MC9 was subsequently adopted and became
effective on March 1, 1938.
The Maloney Amendment, in addition to adding a new section to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, effected certain amendments in
Section 15 (c). These amendments are designed to clarify and
strengthen the direct regulatory powers of the Commission with
respect to the over-the-counter markets, as well as to provide the
Commission with certain additional direct powers over fictitious
quotations and the financial responsibility of brokers and dealers.
As a result of these amendments the former Section 15 (c) became
Section 15 (c) (1). Therefore, on June 28, 1938, the rules defining
manipulative, deceptive, and fraudulent practices in the over-thecounter markets were repromulgated under the new Section 15 (c)
(1), and the rules renumbered as Rules X-15Cl-l through X -15CI-9.

REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
Examination of Securities Act Registration Statements

Unless a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933
is in effect as to a security, the security may not (except where one of
the exemptions from registration provided by the Act is available)
be publicly offered for sale or sold in interstate commerce or through
the mails. A security may be registered by filing with the Commission on an appropriate form a registration statement meeting the
conditions specified in the Act. Forms have been prescribed by the
Commission for registration of the various types of security. All
of these forms are designed to secure a fair disclosure of material facts
concerning the security to be offered for sale to the public and the
issuer thereof, in order that the investor may thus be better able
intelligently to appraise its desirability as an investment.
A required part of each registration statement is a prospectus
which must contain the more essential information set forth in the
registration statement.
A copy of such prospectus must be given
to every person to whom the security covered thereby is offered for
sale and to every purchaser at or before the time of the sale.
The registration statement becomes effective on the twentieth day
after its filing with the Commission, except in certain cases as provided
in the Act. This 20-day period enables an investor to consider facts
concerning the proposed security issue before it is offered for sale. It
also gives a reasonable time for the Commission to make an examination of the registration statement for omissions, incomplete disclosures
and inaccuracies. Under the Securities Act of 1933 the Commission
is not empowered to express approval of the merits or value of any
security, but is limited to requiring the disclosure of the material
facts necessary for the investor to exercise properly his own judgment.
It is important to note that the registration statement constitutes
a record of the representations made in connection with the offering,
and thus, if any such representations were false, simplifies the problem
of proof in any legal proceedings which may result.
Where the examination and analysis of the registration statement
disclose deficiencies but nevertheless reveal an honest attempt to meet
the specified requirements, the registrant is advised of the deficiencies.
In such case the deficiencies may be corrected by the filing of amendments. However, where the examination shows that the registration
statement includes untrue statements or omissions of material facts
which reflect intentional or reckless disregard of the standard of fair
disclosure prescribed by the Act, stop order proceedings usually are
instituted immediately. The Commission also has the power to
refuse registration in any case where the information presented in
the registration statement is incomplete or inaccurate on its face and
to undertake investigations involving examination of the issuer, under-

36

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

writer, or any other person to determine whether a stop order should
issue in any particular case. In addition, the Commission may suspend registration even after a registration statement becomes effective where it develops that the information furnished therein is untrue
or misleading in any material respect.
The Act provides that neither the fact that a registration statement
for a security has been filed or is in effect, nor the fact that a stop order
is not in effect with respect to that particular statement, shall be
deemed a finding by the Commission that the registration statement is
true and accurate on its face, or that it does not contain an untrue
statement of material fact, or a material omission, or be held to mean
that the Commission has in any way passed upon the merits of, or
given its approval to, the security. The statute makes it a criminal
offense to represent otherwise to any prospective purchaser.
Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
provides for the filing of annual reports with the Commission by certain issuers having securities registered under the Securities Act of
1933. During the year there were filed 180 such annual reports, which
were examined in the same manner as registration statements.
In order to give some indication of the result of the Commission's
examinations in securing fair disclosure in registration statements, a
few typical cases are briefly summarized below:
(1) A registrant acting as sponsor-depositor of an unincorporated
investment trust sought to register 18,000,000 trust shares to be offered
to the public at varying prices based upon the previous day's closing
sale prices of the trust's portfolio. The proposed aggregate offering
price of these shares approximated $19,620,000. The sponsor-depositor had previously registered two blocks amounting to 862,069 and
3,000,000 shares, respectively.
The prospectus contained a tabulated sample price make-up sheet
representing that in the computation of the daily offering price of the
trust shares the only premium, commonly called "service charge" or
"load," to be received by the registrant was the 9~% premium for
the sale of shares to the public plus "breakage" of fractional cents
resulting from rounding out the offering price per share to the next
higher cent where fractions of a cent were involved. This representation as to the amount taken out for such charges was further supported
by a statement in the prospectus that the estimated net proceeds accruing to the investor approximated 91.3 %. (Proceeds to the sponsordepositor corporation of 8.7% of the offering price would approximately equal a 9%% premium on the creation price.)
However, it developed from certain additional information filed
in connection with its third registration statement that the sponsordepositor was receiving income in connection with the sale of securities
in an amount exceeding the charges disclosed in the prospectus. Fur-

FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

37

ther examination revealed that this registrant enjoyed unrevealed
profits adverse to the interests of the trust and security holders. The
chief source of such unrevealed profits, discovered as a result of the
Commission's investigation, arose from the mechanics employed in
the creation of trust shares. The sponsor-depositor "closed" with the
trustee at 4:30 p. m., at which time the sponsor-depositor had before
it the price make-up sheet used during the current day and the newly
determined price make-up sheet to be used the following day. In the
event the "new" price was higher than the "current" price, orders received were filled, and additional shares were purchased in advance of
orders, at the lower "current" price, such unordered shares being sold
the following day at a higher price, the sponsor-depositor pocketing
the increase. Conversely, if the "new" price were lower, the sponsordepositor withheld placing orders on shares already sold to the public,
pocketing the difference represented by the decline in the market for
the period such purchases were withheld. Through this device (not
disclosed in the registration statement) the registrant made additional
profits and the trust was deprived of funds which would otherwise
have flown into it. Furthermore, the sponsor-depositor used different
bases in creating and in selling shares whereby it was able to acquire
trust shares from the "trustee" at the bid value of the portfolio underlying the shares, although in selling the same shares it used the sales
value and added thereto the "load." It was the sponsor-depositor
who received the benefit of this "spread" between the closing bid and
closing sales price of the portfolio per share.
The Commission discovered from its investigation that by reason
of this undisclosed practice, together with the method of computing
the creation and offering prices of the trust shares, and the profits
from the so-called "breakage" received by the registrant, the "load"
borne by investors approximated 12%, rather than 9%% as claimed
in the registration statement, and that therefore approximately 88%
of the investors' funds actually accrued to the trust, instead of
approximately 91.3% as represented in the prospectus.
Because of these material omissions, and the failure to set forth
clearly in the prospectus certain other information required to be
furnished, the Commission instituted proceedings, resulting in the
issuance of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of all three of
the registration statements filed by this registrant. Subsequently
the registrant amended its registration statement so as to include
those material facts, as well as a statement of its contingent liability
to purchasers of its shares resulting from failure properly to disclose
these facts.
(2) In a registration statement as originally filed by a company
organized to construct and operate a mill for the purpose of refining
and milling custom ores, it was stated that various engineers had

38

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE OOMMISSION

attested to adequacy of ore reserves in the surrounding territory.
One engineer indicated in a report which was filed as a part of the
registration statement that a property near the mill contained a
potential ore body of some 2,000,000 tons of ore with values averaging
$12 per ton. As a further apparent indication of the need for a mill, the
issuer had drawn 12 contingent contracts with the owners of surround
ing properties which provided lor the supplying and milling of ores.
These "contracts" provided no penalty for the failure top rovide ores
in the amounts specified therein. As a result of an investigation by the
Commission, the registration statement was amended by the registrant,
before it became effective, so as to include the following statements:
a. "The investor should bear in mind that this is a highly
speculative proposition. It involves construction at investor's
expense of a comparatively large custom mill in a district where
suitable ore in substantial quantity has not been blocked out
and is not known to exist (beyond an amount sufficient for
about three month's operation of the mill at initial capacity),
in anticipation that if adequate milling facilities are made
readily available suitable ore will be discovered, mined and
delivered to the proposed mill by mines which cannot, or do
not wish to, incur the expense and hazard of constructing and
operating their own mills."
b. "Records of shipments of ore during 1937 in this vicinity
indicate that all were of high grade, and showed one mine
shipped two hundred tons, one shipped thirty tons, one shipped
five tons and one shipped two tons * * * None of these
mines, except possibly one or two, is equipped to mine and
deliver low grade ore in quantity, and all or most of them
would require financial aid * * *."
c. "A principal purpose of this company is to provide milling facilities for the --Company 24 and thus afforded an
opportunity to develop its mining properties without incurring
the additional expense to itself or its stockholders of erecting
and operating its own mill."
d. "There is no provision for the withholding or escrow of
proceeds of sales of stock until a specified amount estimated as
sufficient to complete necessary construction and assure operation has been subscribed, and if a sufficient amount should
not be received the company would have only a partially completed mill or a plant without adequate capital to operate and
stockholders would be faced with the necessity of raising more
funds or of suffering losses on their investments."
(3) A newly formed corporation, described as an investment trust

shares out of an authorized 300,000 shares with a stated value of $1
per share.
At the time of filing there were 907 shares of stock outstanding
sold to the members of the management group for a cash consideration
of $15 per share. The initial offering price was to be $15 per share
and thereafter at the liquidating value, based on the market value of
investments, plus a "load" of 7~% of such offering price.
The plan of operation provided for a management contract with a
corporation formed in 1929 which had sponsored another trust since
that time. The prospectus as originally filed contained six pages of
statistical data including a summary of the record made by the
managed trust and a comparison of such record with the results which
would have been obtained had a permanent investment of $10,000
been made in common stock of each of the 15 largest corporations; 15
corporations for which was recorded the greatest number of sales on the
New York Stock Exchange during 1928; or the 15 corporations having
the largest number of stockholders during the period January 9, 1929,
to December 31, 1937, which was selected for these comparisons.
These data purported to show the advantage of a managed investment and ended with a comparative table on a percentage basis showing that the trust suffered a shrinkage of only 11.8% in value for the
period under review, whereas the other groups on the arbitrary basis
assumed showed shrinkages ranging from 30.6% to 71.3%. The
Commission took the position that such a comparison, based on the
one hand on actual facts and on the other on assumed transactions on
a different basis, was misleading. As a result, the statistical tables and
percentages were eliminated from the prospectus, there being substituted therefor a clear statement of the proposed operation of the new
trust and data concerning the record made by the old trust under the
same management.
(4) A Delaware corporation filed a registration statement covering
15,000 shares of $1.50 convertible preferred stock (par value $5) and
52,750 shares of common stock ($1 par). Under the charter provisions the preferred stock was entitled in liquidation to $25 per share
and was proposed to be offered at $27.50 per share to net the company $25, of which $5 was to be allocated to capital and $20 to paid-in
surplus. Under the Delaware statutes, corporations may pay dividends on any class of stock out of paid-in surplus. The registration
statement and prospectus did not disclose the possibility that thus,
under the laws of Delaware, the common stock holders might receive
dividends out of surplus contributed by the preferred stock holders,
thereby taking away the surplus contributed by the preferred holders
covering the excess of liquidating value over par value. Accordingly,
the Commission required the registrant to include as a footnote to the

40

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

preferred stock account in the balance sheet a statement of the aggregate amount to which the preferred stock would be entitled in liquidation, and an opinion of counsel for the company as to whether there
was any legal restriction on surplus by reason of the fact that the
amount to which preferred shareholders would be entitled in liquidation exceeded the par value of the stock. It was stated in the footnote that in the opinion of counsel there was no such restriction but
that it was the present intention of the company to limit the payment
of dividends to the amount of surplus in excess of $20 per share of
preferred stock outstanding.
Since the effective date of the registration statement, the company
has indicated its intention to remove from surplus and allocate to
capital, by proper legal procedure, a sufficient amount of such surplus
to cover the full liquidating value of the preferred stock.
Statistics of Securities Registered Under the Securities Act

At the beginning of the fiscal year there were 3,281 registration statements on file, of which 2,571 were effective, 143 were under stop or
refusal order, and 422 had been withdrawn, while 145 were under
examination or held pending the receipt of amendments.
During the year 459 additional registration statements were filed,
and there were 454 registration statements which became effective
(of which latter all but 13 were fully effective); a total of 2,941 statements were effective at the end of the period, 84 of those effective at
the beginning of the period or during the period either having been
withdrawn or placed under stop order.
The net number of registration statements withdrawn during the
year increased by 156, to a total of 578 on June 30, 1938. The net
number of stop or refusal orders increased during the period by 10, a
total of 153 of such orders being in effect on June 30, 1938. As of
June 30, 1938, there were 68 registration statements in the process of
examination or awaiting amendments.
Appendix III contains a list of the registration statements as to
which stop orders, consent refusal orders, and withdrawal orders were
issued during the year. It also jincludes the name of the registrant

each case.
It might be well to point out that apart from the 459 additional
registration statements proper there were also filed during the year a
total of 1,813 amendments to registration statements.P

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938, registrations for
$1,912,000,000 of new securities 26 became effective under the Securities Act. This compares with a total of $4,686,000,000 for the
previous fiscal year and $4,677,000,000 for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1936.
Of the total of $1,912,000,000 which was registered during the
year, approximately 29.1% of the total must be deducted as having
been registered for purposes other than immediate cash sales for the
account of the registrants. This figure includes $270,000,000 of
securities which were to be reserved against the conversion of issues
having convertible features; $124,000,000 registered "for the account
of others"; $76,000,000 registered for exchange for other securities
mainly in connection with substitution of new bonds or preferred
stocks for the old issues; $54,000,000 reserved against the exercise of
options and warrants; $4,000,000 for issuance for various assets,
claims, selling commissions, etc., and $28,000,000 reserved for subsequent issuance.
Registrants expected to offer for immediate cash sale for their own
accounts the balance of $1,356,000,000of registered securities remaining after these deductions. Of this amount, it was anticipated that
approximately $60,000,000 (4.4% of the estimated gross proceeds)
would go for commissions and discounts to underwriters and agents
and for the registrants' own selling expenses. Slightly more than
$10,000,000 (0.8% of the estimated gross proceeds) would go for
other expenses in connection with the flotation and issuance of
securities. This left approximately $1,286,000,000 as the estimated
net cash proceeds which were expected to be received by the registrants themselves.
Of these net cash proceeds it was indicated that approximately
$457,000,000 or 35.5% would be used for new money purposes. This
is the highest ratio of estimated net proceeds intended for new money
purposes for any fiscal year since the Securities Act became effective.
But it should be noted that as an absolute total it amounts to only
approximately 51% of the new money which was expected to be
raised from the sale of securities registered in the previous fiscal year.
Registration statements indicated that the new money was to be
allocated approximately as follows: $272,000,000 (against $257,000,000
in the preceding fiscal year) for expenditures for plant and equipment
and $185,000,000 (against $633,000,000)for additional working capital.
Of the balance of net cash proceeds indicated in the registration
.. In addition to these new issues, there were effectively registered during the fiscal year ended Jnne 30,
1938,approximately $193,000,000of voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit and securities proposed to
be offered in exchange for registrants' or predecessors' securities as well as the guarantee by a parent company
o( $25,000,000 principal amount ot subsldiary debt. In the preceding fiscal year, registrations of reorganization and exchange securities covered seeunties valued at $164,00<>,000 and there were also registered the guarantees or four individuals on three bond and note Issues having an aggregate principal amount of slightly

Of the total of $1,642,000,000 of securities effectively registered
(after deducting amounts reserved against conversion), approximately $463,000,000 or 28.2% were for common stock issues;
$250,000,000 or 15.2% were for preferred stock issues; $228,000,000
or 13.9% were for certificates of participation, beneficial interest and
warrants; $321,000,000 or 19.5% were for secured bonds; $367,000,000
or 22.4% were for debentures and $13,000,000 or 0.8% were for shortterm notes. Interest-bearing obligations, then, totaled 42.7%, stock
issues 43.4%, and other types of securities 13.9%.
Approximately $601,000,000 or 36.6% of the total registrations
(after deducting only the amounts reserved against conversion) were
for manufacturing companies; $458,000,000 or 27.9 % were for financial
and investment companies; $454,000,000 or 27.7% were for electric
light and power, gas and water utility companies; $44,000,000 or
2.6% were for transportation and communication companies (exclusive
of common carriers exempted under the Securities Act); $27,000,000

Detailed statistical tables showing number of issues, type of securities, classification of issuers, gross proceeds, net proceeds, cost of
distribution, channels of distribution, and proposed use of funds for
the securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933 during the
year ended June 30, 1938, are contained in Appendix V. In interpreting the tables as well as the summary figures quoted above, it should be
kept in mind that these statistics are based solely on the registration
statements filed by the registrants with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. All the data, therefore, refer to registrants' intentions
and estimates as they appear in the registration statements on the
effective dates and, thus: in reality represent statistics of intentions to
sell securities rather than statistics of actual sales of securities.
EXEMPTION

FROM REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
ACT OF 1933

OF SECURITIES

Under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
Commission is authorized to prescribe rules and regulations providing
for conditional exemptions of certain issues of securities from the
provisions of this Act. This subsection provides, however, that no
issue of securities shall be exempted where the aggregate amount at
which such issue is offered to the public exceeds $100,000. The
Commission, acting pursuant to this authority, has adopted Regulations A, B, and B-T, the latter of which became effective on March
1, 1938. Regulation A pertains to exemptions other than those
relating to oil and gas interests. Regulation B covers exemptions
relating to fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights. Regulation B-T provides for exemptions pertaining to interests in an oil
royalty trust or similar type of trust or unincorporated association.
During the past fiscal year there were received and examined 353
prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation A of the General
Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933. The securities covered by these propectuses represent an aggregate offering
price, mainly of stocks, of $26,827,793. Numerous amendments filed
in connection with these prospectuses were also examined.
Also, during the past fiscal year, there were received and examined
1,794 offering sheets, together with 630 amendments, filed pursuant to
Regulation B of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933. The securities covered by these offering sheets
represent an aggregate offering price of approximately $20,000,000.
The following statistics indicate the various actions of the Commission

Up to June 30, 1938, no filings had as' yet been made under
Regulation B-T.
On April 22, 1938, the Commission undertook a tentative simplification of its rules governing exemptions by adopting an additional
exemption designated as Rule 210 of Regulation A. This was designed
as a temporary rule and to aid the Commission in ascertaining whether
a lightening of such requirements would help small business enterprises
to raise capital. This rule was to remain in effect until October 29,
1938,27and is applicable to any issue of securities offered for cash
provided the aggregate offering price does not exceed $100,000, but
does not apply to oil and gas interests which are covered by Regulations Band B-T. The primary condition of this new exemption is
the compliance with the Blue Sky Laws of all States in which the
securities are offered, sold, or delivered after sale. This exemption
does not extend to transactions effected in the District of Columbia.
As a further condition of the exemption, a notice of intention to issue
securities under the new rule must be filed at the Washington office
of the Commission. In addition, copies of all prospectuses, letters or
other communications used at the commencement of the public offering or subsequently sent to more than 10 persons are to be filed with
the Commission prior to use.
As an integral part of this effort to ascertain if alteration of these
requirements would assist particularly the small business enterprise
in obtaining new capital more simply and economically, the Commission established during the month of April, a special unit in the
Registration Division to which was assigned the function of aiding
prospective registrants and advising them and their representatives
on any problems which may arise in connection with their registration
statements.
Pending completion of this program, a number of
amendments were made in the existing forms. One of these was an
amendment to Form A-2. This form may be used by corporations,
other than finance companies, which have total assets not exceeding

million dollars and which have been in existence for at least 5 years
.and have had a net income for 1 fiscal year of the past 5. However,
.as a result of the amendment, corporations meeting these conditions
.are permitted to omit historical financial information and are required
to file certified profit-and-loss statements, and schedules supporting
balance sheet and profit-and-loss statements, only for the latest fiscal
'year before the date of the certified balance sheet and for any period
between the two. This amendment is experimental in nature and will
not be effective after October 29, 1938, unless further action is taken
by the Commission."
During the last 2 months of the year, when Rule 210 was in force,
the Commission received and examined thereunder 45 letters of notifi-cation for issues aggregating $3,034,000. In this connection, a comparison of the filings under Rules 202 and 210 during the months of
May and June 1938 with filings under Rule 202 for the preceding 2
months and the corresponding months a year before might be of some
interest. In May 1938 there were filed 17 prospectuses under Rule
202 involving an aggregate offering of $1,356,700 together with 23
Ietters of notification under Rule 210 involving an aggregate offering
of $1,405,000, making a total of 40 filings involving $2,761,700. CorTesponding figures for June 1938 were 26 prospectuses, $1,750,000;
22 letters of notification, $1,629,000; or a total of 48 filings involving
$3,379,000. In comparison the prospectuses under Rule 202 filed in
March 1938 numbered 31 for $2,094,500 and in April 1938, 29 for
$2,157,300. Such prospectuses filed in May 1937 numbered 44 for
$3,549,105 and for June 1937 there were 37 for $3,050,700.

A program of basic revision of the forms for registration of securities
and for reports by issuers under the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was carried forward by the Commission during the past fiscal year. In addition, the preparation of a
new accounting handbook containing a compilation of the requirements as to form and content of financial statements filed with registration statements of and reports by issuers under the Securities Act
of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was carried forward
during the year. Like the general form for registration, which is in
process of preparation, this handbook when completed will contain
provisions of general application as well as requirements for particular
classes of persons, so that the necessary measure of particularization
may be achieved without undue repetition. Drafts of this compilation of financial requirements and of the proposed general form were

ants, lawyers, investment bankers, security analysts, teachers, and
other experts in the securities field. At the close of the fiscal year,
the Commission was engaged in re-examining the material in the light
of the comments and suggestions of such experts. The other new
forms in the series, for special types of securities and issuers, were
also in the course of preparation.
Principal forms in this group were
those for recently organized issuers and for fixed investment trusts.
A number of amendments to the existing forms for registration under
the Securities Act of 1933 were also made during the past year and
several revisions of rules and regulations were adopted.
Additional interpretative opinions were published during the past
year. These opinions were designed to assist registrants in making
prospectuses concise and intelligible to the investing public without
omitting material information or violating the Securities Act of 1933.
By taking portions of actual prospectuses :filed under the Act and
reducing them to a fraction of their original length, the opinions
pointed out the possibilities for eliminating excess legal verbiage and
providing more readable documents. The examples of condensed
statements in these opinions were followed in many prospectuses
subsequently prepared by registrants.
During the past year several changes were made in the forms and
rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.2S
The Commission also adopted and published a new form (Form 24-K)
for annual reports of bank holding companies. This form completed
the series of forms for annual reports of issuers having securities
registered on national securities exchanges.
During the last part of the fiscal year, the existing regulations
and forms under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
were set up in form for inclusion in the Code of Federal Regulations,
under the supervision of the Codification Board, as required by the
Federal Register Act and the regulations of the Administrative
Committee of the Federal Register.

importance. Within a few months after the passage of the Act on
August 26, 1935, a total of 58 suits were brought challenging the Act
as unconstitutional; none, however, but this single case instituted by
the Government as a test suit culminated in a decision on constitutionality by the Supreme Court. Burco v. Whitworth, 297 U. S.
726 (936), ended with the denial of a petition for certiorari.
North
American Company v. Landis, 299 U. S. 248 (1936), terminated with a
decision by the Supreme Court vacating the District Court's order
and remanding the cause for further proceedings. The Supreme
Court sustained the power of the District Court to stay its own
proceedings and thus affirmed the position taken by the Government.
The remaining suits were handled in accordance with a uniform policy
developed by the Commission in collaboration with the Department of
Justice. No effort was made to defend on their merits actions brought
outside the District of Columbia, and in each such suit appropriate
motions were made for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The suits
then remained pending as to the local Government officials. In 26cases injunctions were issued against parties subject to the jurisdiction
of the court, and in the remainder, the courts either refused to make
any disposition until after a decision by the Supreme Court on theconstitutionality of the Act or the parties themselves agreed to hold
the litigation in abeyance until such a decision.
The status of cases involving the constitutionality of the Act still
pending during the fiscal year is indicated in Table 6 of Appendix VI.
It may be noted here that in some of these cases the bill of complaint
has already been dismissed and that in all of the cases the company
involved has registered pursuant to the mandate of the SupremeCourt, so that the issues between the Commission and such company
are moot. The Electric Bond & Share case thus marks the successful
conclusion of a preliminary phase in the administration of this highly
important statute.
The suit was begun in the United States District Court for theSouthern District of New York on November 26, 1935, by a bill of
complaint which sought to compel the principal defendant and 12 intermediate holding companies in the Bond and Share holding company
system to comply with Sections 4 (a) and 5 of the Act. The defendants' answer to the bill of complaint was divided into two parts:
a first defense by which they sought to have the bill dismissed on the
ground that not only Sections 4 (a) and 5 but the entire Act, including
each and every provision thereof, was unconstitutional; and a separate
and distinct defense by way of counterclaim and cross bill by which
they sought to enjoin the plaintiff Commission and the individual
cross defendants from enforcing any provision of the Act and sought
to obtain a declaratory judgment that the whole Act, including each
and every provision thereof, was unconstitutional.
On June 30, 1936~
a stipulation of facts, approximately 2,000 pages in length, was filed

48

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

with the court. On January 29, 1937, Judge Julian W. Mack, in an
exhaustive opinion, held that the registration provisions were the
only provisions of the Act as to which any justiciable controversy
existed or was presented to the court; that the registration provisions
were separable from the other provisions of the Act and standing
alone served a useful purpose to which legal effect could be given;
and that the registration provisions, as applied to the 13 defendants,
constituted a valid exercise by the Congress of the federal power over
interstate commerce and the mails. The District Court further held
that the cross bill presented no justiciable case or controversy, "and
no actual controversy" within the Federal Declaratory Judgments
Act, and that in any event defendants have failed to show irreparable
or substantial damage, present or imminent, to support the cross bill.
By its decree the District Court dismissed the cross bill both as against
the plaintiff Commission and the individual cross defendants, and
awarded relief as prayed for in the bill of complaint by ordering that the
13 defendants be enjoined, so long as they should not have registered
with the Commission under Sections 4 (a) and 5 (a) of the Act, from
carrying on any of the activities in interstate commerce or through
the mails forbidden to unregistered holding companies by the several
subparagraphs of Section 4 (a). (18 Fed. Supp. 131 (S. D. N. Y.
1937).) The Circuit Court of Appeals, on November 8, 1937, all
three judges concurring, affirmed the District Court's decree both in
the enforcement of the registration provisions and the dismissal of
the cross bill (92 F. (2d) 580 (C. C. A. 2d, 1937)}.
On March 28, 1938, the Supreme Court, speaking through Mr.
Chief Justice Hughes, reaffirmed the decree of the District Court.
Mr. Justice McReynolds dissented without opinion, and Mr. J ustice
Cardozo and Mr. Justice Reed took no part in the consideration and
decision of the case. The Court concluded that the defendant companies are engaged in activities within the reach of the power of
Congress; that Sections 4 (a) and 5 are separable from the remaining
provisions of the Act; and that standing alone the registration provisions constitute a useful and valid regulation by the informatory
process. The cross bill was disposed of as follows:
"Defendants are not entitled to invoke the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act in order to obtain an advisory decree upon
a hypothetical state of facts. . ..
By the cross bill, defendants seek a judgment that each and every provision of the
Act is unconstitutional.
It presents a variety of hypothetical
controversies which may never become real. We are invited
to enter into a speculative inquiry for the purpose of condemning statutory provisions the effect of which in concrete situations, not yet developed, cannot now be definitely perceived.
We must decline that invitation."

England Power Association was not a subsidiary of International
Hydro-Electric System and the Company, and that Moreau Manufacturing Oorporation was not a subsidiary of International HydroElectric System and the Company. If these applications were filed
in good faith, the statute afforded the Oompany a temporary exemption from the requirements of the Act.
While these exemptions were pending, on March 12, 1937, the
Company filed an application with the Commission in which it
asked (1) for a report "in the manner provided in Section 11 (g) (2)
of said Act," on a plan for change in capitalization which it desired
to propose for the approval and authorization of its shareholders,
and (2) for an order exempting it from the provisions of Sections 4 (a)
and 6 (a) of the Act, and from all other provisions applicable to the
changes in shareholders' rights involved in the plan and to the
securities which it proposed to issue under the plan.
Justification for this somewhat unusual request was claimed to exist
in the fact that if the exemption which the Company claimed to enjoy
should be terminated by act of the Commission after the plan had
become effective and after the change in securities had been completed,
doubt would be cast upon the legality of the securities proposed to be
issued under the plan. On March 29, 1937, the Commission conducted a hearing on the application for a report on the plan and for
exemption from the relevant provisions of the Act. On May 5, 1937,
the Commission issued a report on the reorganization plan and an
opinion without order declaring that power existed to make the report,
and thereafter, on July 31; 1937, following a second hearing, the Commission issued an order exempting the Company from the provisions
of Sections 4 (a) and 6 (a) and all other sections of the Act applicable
to the proposed plan."
On September 11, 1937, John Lawless, Jr., filed a petition for review
in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit alleging that the
Commission had no power to make the report or order and requesting
that such action be set aside. The decision of the Court has not yet
been announced.
It Chairman Douglas, In a written opinion, dissented from the order of July 31, 1937. Cornmlssioner
Healy, likewise In written opinions, dissented from the report on the plan and opmion accompanying the
report and took no part In the order of July 31, 1937.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

One other proceeding may be noted here. Section 11 (g) of the Act
provides, in part, that in any proceeding in a court of the United
States in which a receiver or trustee is appointed for any registered
holding company, the court shall not appoint any person other than
the Commission as trustee or receiver without notifying the Commission and giving it an opportunity to be heard before making any such
appointment.
More than a year after the effective date of the registration requirements of the Act, Utilities Power and Light Corporation filed a petition for reorganization under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois. On January 9, 1937, 5 days after the petition
was filed, the debtor was temporarily continued in possession, and on
March 6,1937, this possession was made permanent, and an investigator was appointed to consider and report upon certain charges of mismanagement. This report was filed with the Court on July 30, 1937,
and on the following day the Commission was notified that on August
2,1937, a hearing would be held for the purpose of considering whether
the debtor should be kept in possession or whether an independent
trustee should be appointed. Taking the view that the circumstances
of the case required an independent trustee to represent and protect
the interests of investors and consumers, the Commission appeared at
the hearing as amicus curiae and moved for the discharge of the
debtor. After extended argument and despite opposition, the Court,
on August 14, 1937, accepted the view of the Commission and entered
an order removing the debtor from possession and appointing Mr.
Willoughby G. Walling trustee for the estate.
LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND THE

As a result of suits instituted by the Commission, by June 30, 1938,
486 firms and individuals had been permanently enjoined from the
acts and practices complained of, 217 of such injunctions having been
obtained during the past fiscal year."
Cases that were pending under the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the past fiscal year are listed
and briefly described in Appendix VI. Among the more interesting
cases which merit a fuller description are the following:
United Siaue v: Troutman, et al.-On February 21, 1938, Percival
H. Troutman, President of the Union Trust Company of Denver,
Colo., and Ralph L. Young, President of the Bankers National
Securities Corporation of Denver, Wale convicted of violation of the
Securities Act of 1933. Troutman was sentenced to serve 5 years in
Leavenworth and fined $2,500, and Young was sentenced to serve
15 months, for conspiracy. One defendant was found not guilty
and a verdict of acquittal was direoted as to another. The defendants

were charged with making false representations in the sale of trust
agreements and securities of a group of corporations and investment
trusts known as the "Union Group." The companies operated by
the defendants had been operating at a loss and the whole picture
was one of a shell composed of fictitious assets. The operations were
largely carried on by means of the so-called "sell and switch" device
and the defendants were charged with having induced a large number
of persons in many states to switch out of one kind of investment
trust unit into another kind of unit or into stock of corporations
affiliated with the Union Trust Company. On March 3, 1938, the
defendants filed notice of appeal.
Pace v: United States.-An indictment was returned in the Northern
District of Texas alleging that four defendants had violated the fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of stock of the Atlas
Holding Company, a Nevada corporation. Three defendants pleaded
guilty and received sentences ranging from 18 months to 4 years.
The fourth defendant, S. A. Pace, was convicted and sentenced to 7
years in the penitentiary.
On February 8, 1938, the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit confirmed the conviction of Pace. The
Circuit Court found that the evidence showed that Pace and the other
defendants had "* * * devised and operated a scheme to defraud
holders of stock in building and loan associations by exchanging with
them the shares of the Atlas Holding Company. Acting in concert,
these parties obtained the names of numerous parties who were not
versed in the business of securities and investments, and who had
deposited their earnings, or purchased stock, in building and loan
associations which had been embarrassed by the depression and had
either suspended payment of dividends, curtailed dividends, or were
in liquidation. These small investors were approached by one or
more of the defendants, and representations were made to them that
the affairs of the association were being grossly mismanaged; that
there was a deficiency of assets; and that the association's stock was
otherwise a bad investment. The Atlas stock was represented to be
a safe and sound investment yielding high earnings. It was usually
represented that the particular association under discussion owned
certain property which the defendants, or Atlas, wished to acquire,
and that the association's stock would be worth par to them in the
purchase of the property. The victim being persuaded, the transfer
was effected by the defendants, acting in concert and cooperating to
the end that the victim parted with whatever remained of his earnings
for a stock that was worthless."
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Harry Ladner, et al.-Qn
June 28, 1938, the Commission instituted an injunctive proceeding in
the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin
Harry Ladner and Karl S. Ladner from violation of the fraud pro-

visions of the Securities Act of 1933. The defendants had acquired
more than $1,000,000 worth of the securities of the Studebaker Corporation of New Jersey, the Richfield Oil Company of California, the
Willys-Overland Company and other corporations, which, through
receiverships and reorganizations, had been succeeded by successor
corporations of the same or similar names. The Commission alleged
that the defendants were preparing to launch a campaign to sell these
obsolete and worthless certificates by representing that they were the
securities of the successor corporations. On the same date that the
action was instituted the defendants consented to the entry of a permanent injunction.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Universal Service Association, et al.-On March 30, 1936, the Commission filed a bill of complaint in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to
enjoin Universal Service Association and certain individuals from
violations of the registration and fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 in the sale of what, according to the allegations of the
Commission, constituted securities. The Universal Service Association and the Universal Order of Plenocrats were engaged in securing
"applications for enrollment" in their two companies and accepting
payments of "contributions" on these applications. The defendants
contended that the Universal Order of Plenocrats, the name of which
was a combination of Latin and Greek words meaning "The Power
of Plenty," was engaged in teaching American citizens how to establish and maintain a cooperative Commonwealth and that the "contributions" would be used to bring forth a natural increase from the
natural resources of the earth. The enrollees were assured ot an increase 'of 30% per annum on the "contributions" and the return of
such "contributions" intact at the expiration of 5 years. The Commission contended that the sale of memberships in the order was
nothirig more than the sale of securities as that term is defined in the
Securities Act of 1933. The Commission further contended that the
fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 had been violated in
that the defendants had failed to disclose that both the Universal
Service Association and the Universal Order of Plenocrats were and
always had been insolvent and that the payments allegedly made
from the "30% natural increase" were in fact paid out of the contributions of subsequent members. On April 14, 1938, a permanent
injunction restraining further violations of the registration and fraud
provisions was entered. The defendants have filed notice of intention to appeal.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. R. J. Koeppe &J Oompany,
et al.-On November 9, 1936, the Commission filed a bill of complaint
in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois charging
the defendants, a firm of brokers and dealers, with violations of both

54

SECURITIES

Al'."D EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
through a series of market manipulations in the stock of the Paducah
Cooperage Co., Inc., and the Wahl Company during the fall of 1935.
The Commission alleged that during a 3-month period the price of
Paducah stock was raised some 200 percent and quickly collapsed as
soon as support was withdrawn. It was further alleged that the
advance in price of both stocks was accomplished by a heavy volume
of trading; buying at the high for the day; establishing the closing
price for the day; placing matched orders; paying commissions to
other brokers who induced their customers to purchase the stock;
etc. The District Court found that the manipulation itself constituted a violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
failure to inform many of the persons to whom the defendants were
selling stock at the market that the price was being advanced by their
manipulations was fraud under the terms of the Securities Act of 1933.
On April 30, 1937, a permanent injunction was granted from which the
defendants appealed. On February 4, 1938, the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the decree.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Torr & 00., et al.-In December 1935, the Commission instituted suit in the District Court for the
Southern District of N ew York to enjoin certain individuals and a
co-partnership from further violations of the fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 prohibiting manipulation of security prices. The Commission alleged that the defendants distributed stock of the Trans-Lux
Daylight Picture Screen Corporation against an option held by Torr
& Company, and that their methods of distribution involved manipulation and a conspiracy designed to cause purchasers to be deceived
through having various persons, agents of the defendants, recommend
the purchase of Trans-Lux stock without disclosing the fact that such
persons were to receive as commissions for making these recommendations $12.50 to $25.00 per hundred shares for all purchases of the stock
on the New York Curb Exchange that could be attributed to their
recommendations.
The Commission further alleged that the purchases which were the consequence of the recommendations resulted
in artificially increasing the activity of the stock on the Curb Exchange.
A preliminary injunction was obtained in the District Court which
was appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
and there reversed on the ground of lack of justification for special
relief pending trial. The Commission thereafter had a hearing on
the merits before the District Court, and a permanent injunction was
granted March 4, 1938, against Torr & Company and 11 individuals,
restraining further violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and against 2 individuals restraining
further violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Benjamin Franklin Foundation, Inc., et al.; Securities arid Exchange Oommission v. Oapital
Savings Plan, Inc., et al.; Securities and Exchange Oommission v.
Financial Independence Founders, Inc.-On February 4, and June 27,
1938, the Commission filed bills in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey to restrain Benjamin Franklin Foundation, Inc., together with certain of its officers, and Financial Independence Founders, Inc., respectively, from violations of registration
and fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. On June 23, 1938,
suit was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania to enjoin Capital Savings Plan, Inc., and
Independence Shares Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary, from
violations of the fraud provisions of such Act. Each of the companies
was engaged in the issuance and distribution of certain types of
investment trust certificates commonly known as "Thrift" or "Foundation" plans which peculiarly originated in this country shortly after
the precipitous decline of market values in the fall of 1929. In form,
the certificates were investment contracts which contemplated
monthly payments of $10 or more, in multiples of $5, over a period of
10 years to a corporate trustee which immediately applied such monies
to the purchase of shares of an underlying investment trust, either of
the fixed or restricted management type. All three complaints
alleged that the defendants in the sale of their respective certificates
had misrepresented material facts relative to the character and operation of such certificates and had omitted to reveal various fees and
costs charged against the payments made thereon by reason of which
the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, were misleading. On February 10, 1938, Benjamin
Franklin Foundation, Inc., and three of its officers consented to the
entry of the permanent injunction prayed for in the Commission's
bill, without admitting wilfullness in the violations alleged. On
June 23 and June 27, 1938, permanent injunctions were likewise
consented to and entered against Capital Savings Plan, Inc., and its
subsidiary company, and against Financial Independence Founders,
Inc., respectively, restraining them from the violations alleged.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Sunbeam Gold Mines Oompany, et al.-In May 1937, the Commission instituted an injunctive
action in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Washington to enjoin the issuance of promissory notes by the Sunbeam Gold Mines Company without compliance with the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The defendant company, Sunbeam Gold Mines Company, which had previously been
enjoined from further violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the broker-dealer provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, was engaged in negotiations looking to the

56

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

acquisition of the assets of Golden West Mining Company, which
had previously been enjoined from further violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the broker-dealer
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the
course of these negotiations, an offering of promissory notes of the
defendant, Sunbeam Gold Mines Company, was made to its own
existing stockholders and the existing stockholders of Golden West
Mining Company, aggregating approximately 530 in number. The
District Court held that while the notes were securities and had been
the subject of sales, the transactions of the defendants, being confined to existing stockholders, had not, irrespective of the number
of such stockholders, involved a public offering and consequently
were not subject to the requirement of registration. From this
decision the Commission appealed, and on March 21, 1938, the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District
Court, and, after reviewing the legislative history of Section 4 (1)
of the Securities Act of 1933, held that the offering, although confined
to stockholders, was nevertheless a public offering.
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Oonsolidated Mines of Oalifornia, et al.-0n November 30, 1937, the Commission applied to the
District Court for the Southern District of California to enforce compliance with a subpena duces tecum directed against appellants in
the course of the investigation conducted by the Commission into
the affairs of the corporation. The subpena was issued pursuant to
an order of investigation which recited that the Commission had
reasonable grounds to believe that the corporation and its officers
were selling the securities of the corporation, although no registration
statement was on file, in violation of the registration provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933, and thet in the sale of these securities
untrue statements were being made concerning the extent and value
of ore bodies and the profits to be derived by the corporation from
its operation, in violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933. The subpena required the production of engineer's
reports, mining records, and other exhibits and letters concerning
the properties operated by appellant. The Court granted the Commission's application on December 29, 1937, and on June 30, 1938,
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
decision of the lower Court. The Circuit Court held that the subpena was not too broad because the documents called for were clearly
material. It compared the Commission's investigations to those of
a grand jury, where the identity of the offender, and the existence
and nature of the offense are normally developed at the conclusion
of its labors, not at the beginning. For that reason the Court held
that the subpena power should not be limited too narrowly by forecasts of the probable results of the investigation.

Frank J. Ryan v. M. U. Newfield and Western Union Telegraph
Oompany, et al.-In March 1937, three suits were instituted in the
Southern District of Florida against representatives of the Commission and against the Western Union and Postal Telegraph Companies
to enjoin enforcement of and compliance with certain subpenas
duces tecum calling for the production of copies of certain telegrams
sent or received by the plaintiffs. The subpenas were issued pursuant to an order of investigation reciting that the Commission had
reasonable grounds to believe that the securities of the Ryan Florida
Corporation and of the Florida Tex Oil Company had been sold in
violation of the registration and fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 and authorizing an investigation of the corporations and
certain individuals. The three cases, involving almost identical
questions, were consolidated for trial. On April 14, 1937, District
Judge Alexander Akerman, of Tampa, granted interlocutory orders
restraining the enforcement of the subpenas stating that "The rights
of the plaintiffs as to the privacy of their telegrams is protected by
the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and this right extends even when
telegrams are in the possession of the telegraph companies." An
appeal from this decision was taken by the Commission, and on July
22, 1937, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed
the decision of the District Court, holding that the subpenas did not
constitute unreasonable searches and seizures and that the plaintiffs
had no standing to invoke the Fourth or Fifth Amendments. The
Court further stated "* * * we think it plain, that in enacting
the Securities Legislation in question, Congress was well within its
constitutional powers, and that the investigations and subpenas under
attack are fully supported by that legislation." On October 18, 1937,
plaintiffs' petitions for a writ of certiorari were denied by the Supreme
Court of the United States, and on November 8 and November 15,
1937, that Court denied a petition for rehearing and a motion for
leave to file a second petition. On December 2, 1937, Judge Akerman dissolved and vacated the interlocutory orders of injunction and
dismissed all of the plaintiffs' bills.
Woolley v. United States.-On May 31, 1938, the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction
of Ernest R. Woolley, who had been previously sentenced to serve
3 years in the Federal penitentiary and fined $1,000 for perjury during
the course of an investigation conducted by the Commission, the order
for which recited that the Commission had reasonable grounds to
believe that Woolley and others had violated the registration and
fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of stock of
the Cota Oil Company. It was charged that Woolley, after being
duly sworn before an officer of the Commission in connection with
the investigation, testified falsely that he had no part in the organ104139-39--5

58

SECURITIES

A);"D EXCHA);"GE CmnnSSIOK

ization or incorporation of Cota Oil Company and that he was not
connected with the operation of that company and had no information
about its affairs. The Circuit Court upheld the constitutionality of
Section 20 (a) and ruled that even though the investigation was ex
parte false testimony therein constituted perjury. The Court held
that the function of the Commission in investigating probable violations of the Securities Act of 1933 is closely akin to that of the grand
jury, that if false testimony has a tendency to influence the investigation it is material and will support a conviction for perjury, and that
the Commission had authority to "determine what matters are material to an inquiry," which authority may be delegated to an examining
officer. A petition for certiorari has been filed with the SupremeCourt of the United States.
United States v. Secord, Vanderpoel &: Company, Inc., et al.-On
June 29, 1938, Secord, Vanderpoel & Company, Inc., Max Strahl,
Morton Edell, Edwin T. Vanderpoel, and Walter Gutterson, were
found guilty of violation of the Securities Act of 1933 in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with false representations made in the sale of stock of a number
of mining corporations. Lynn N. Secord pleaded guilty, and four other
defendants tried were found not guilty. Certain of the latter are
under indictment by the Federal Grand Jury in New York City for
fraudulent distribution of the stock of Hidalgo Gold Mining Company.
In the Vanderpoel case, sentences ranging from -fines to 3 years
imprisonment were imposed. Before prosecution the Securities and
Exchange Commission obtained temporary injunctions enjoining the
defendants from further violations of the fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933. Secord, Vanderpoel & Company had sold
the various mining company stocks by means of the distribution of
circulars and "market letters" addressed to persons on certain "sucker
lists." The prospective victims were deluged with long-distance
telephone calls urging them to dispose of other securities and invest
in the mining stocks. The victims were then "switched" into the
stock of another company which owned a mine which had not been
in operation since 1929 and possessed no tangible assets, the stock of
which had been bought by Secord, Vanderpoel & Company at from
30~ to 60~ a share and sold at $1.50. False representations were
made that the price of the stock of the latter company would go as
high as $5 within 30 days; that a "pool" was being formed to manipulate the stock; and that the Securities and Exchange Commission had
approved listing of this stock on the New York Curb Exchange.
United States v. R. Cummins &: Company, H. H. Landay, et al.On August 27, 1937, Edward A. Attix, an attorney, Samuel Lafata,
Leonard E. Brown, Harry H. Landay, and Frank R. Lane, all residents
of Detroit, were convicted in the United States District Court at

FO"CRTH AN~UAL REPORT

Detroit, Mich., for violations of the registration and fraud provisions
of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of stock of R. Cummins &
Company. Sentences totaling 19 years and fines totaling $50,000
were imposed. An appeal is pending before the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals. It was alleged that the defendants organized and
dominated R. Cummins & Company, Inc., and issued to themselves
approximately 500,000 shares of bonus stock, much of which was sold
to the public upon the representation that the stock was being sold
for the corporation and that the proceeds from its sale would be paid
into the company's treasury.
The indictment further charged that
the defendants falsely represented that the corporation was an old
established distillery company which formerly operated in Kentucky,
and that they padded the company's payroll, received "kick backs"
from contractors who furnished machinery for the rehabilitation of
the plant, and obtained stock by selling property to the corporation
at prices greatly in excess of the price paid for it.
COMPLAINTS,

INFORMAL

AND FORMAL

INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission still receives a heavy volume of complaints and
inquiries. While most of the complaints come from investors, a
considerable number are received from State Securities Commissions, State and Federal officials, and voluntary agencies such as
Better Business Bureaus and Chambers of Commerce. A reply is
made to every complaint, and to the extent that the Commission's
powers and the subject matter permit, every complaint is investigated. The Commission continued to use its facilities, directly and
through public and private agencies, to call attention to the many
fraudulent and illegal devices too often employed to defraud the
investing public.
At the beginning of the past fiscal year, 750 complaint cases were
pending. During the year, 545 new cases have been set up and 600'
cases disposed of. As of June 30, 1938, 695 cases were pending.
The number of such cases, and of formal and informal investigations
during the past 2 fiscal years, is as follows:

REPORTS OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS
General Scope of Reporting Requirements

Every person who is an officer, director, or principal stockholder(a principal stockholder is one who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of any class of registered equity security) of
an issuer which has any class of equity security listed and registered

FOURTH ANXVAL REPORT

on any national securities exchange is required by Section 16 (a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file with the Commission
and the exchange an initial report showing his holdings of, and a
monthly report disclosing all his transactions in, any equity security
of the company of which he is the direct or indirect beneficial owner.
Likewise, every person who is an officer or a director of a holding
company which is registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, is required by Section 17 (a) thereof to file similar
reports covering his holdings of and transactions in all securities of
the registered holding company and its subsidiaries.

reports filed with and examined by the Commission during each of

Up to the close of the year 25,843 persons had filed with the Commission r09,732 ownership reports disclosing 35,529 different security
ownership positions and changes therein. These reports relate to the
equity securities of 2,345 companies having equity securities registered on national securities exchanges under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and to the securities of 157 holding companies registered
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and of the
subsidiaries thereof.
Decline in Reports Needing Amendment

When the examination of a report indicates that it is deficient.
because of any material incompleteness, inconsistency, or inaccuracy,
an amended report is required to be filed, which is examined in the
same manner as the original report. Where amended reports are
thus necessary, they are obtained, in most cases, in less than a month
after the original was filed. While one out of every five reports filed
during the year 1937 required such arnendment, this ratio dropped to
about one out of every eight during the past year.
Decline in Late Filing of Reports

The law prescribes a period within which each type of report is due
to be filed, and from time to time a certain number of reports are
received after the date they are due. The chief reasons stated for
such delay in the filing of reports include: ignorance of the reporting
requirements; overlooking transactions made by the reporter or his

68

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

broker or agent; illness; absence from office or principal place of
business; delay in obtaining information from partnership or personal
holding company as to its transactions; and ignorance of reductions
in total issued amount of a class of stock, through conversions, etc.,
whereby reporter had unwittingly become a principal stockholder.
The Commission recognizes that, in order to effectuate the purpose
of Sections 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, accurate information as to security transactions should be available to interested
persons as soon as possible after they occur, since the existing statutory
2-year limitation of any action thereunder runs from the date on
which the profit from a purchase and sale or sale and purchase within
the 6-month period was realized. Accordingly, the Commission has
taken steps to eliminate every possible instance of the late filing of
ownership reports, with the result that the proportion of original
Form 4 reports filed late (i. e., after the tenth day of the month
following that which they cover) to the total number
original Form 4
reports filed decreased during the year by about 20%. It might be
added that approximately half of the late reports are generally received not more than a month after the date they are due.

of

Extent of Compliance with Reporting Requirements

An investigation has been made of the extent of compliance with
!the reporting requirements of Section 1.6 (a) of the Securities Ex-change Act of 1934 during the period of nearly 4 years that they have
'been in force. It discloses only 34 known cases of persons who have
failed for various reasons t-o file certain reports apparently required
of them (mainly initial reports of security position on Form 5 or 6)
after the usual efforts have been made to obtain them. A principal
reason for such delinquency in these few instances is the inability
-despite exhaustive search to locate the person who had the obligation
to file the report. It also develops that the companies of which
certain of the persons delinquent in this respect are officersand directors
have been dissolved, or the registration of their securities has been
withdrawn by order of the Commission pursuant to Section 19 (a)
(2) of the Act. However, when it is recalled that more than 35,000
security ownership positions have so far been reported to the Commission, this comparatively small number of delinquents indicates that
not more than one person out of every thousand persons subject to
Section 16 (a) has failed to comply with its provisions to the extent
of filing at least an initial report. .
Publication

of Security Ownership Reports

Information as to the security transactions and holdings of officers,
directors and principal stockholders, disclosed in their reports which
are filed on Forms 4, 5, 6, U-17-1 and U-17-2, is compiled and published by the Commission in a semi-monthly Official Srmmary of

FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

Security Transactions and Holdings which is widely distributed among
newspaper correspondents, individual investors and other interested
persons. Copies of these summaries are also available at each office
of the Commission and each national securities exchange. In addition, the actual reports are available for public inspection both at the
office of the Commission in Washington, D. C., and the particular
exchange with which an additional copy of reports relating to the issuer
concerned must be filed.
SOLICITATION
OF PROXIES,
CONSENTS,
AND AUTHORIZATIONS
UNDER THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934 AND THE.
PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

During the fiscal year, 2,232 solicitations of proxies, consents, or
authorizations and 447 follow-up communications thereon were
examined for compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under authority of Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. In a substantial number of cases in which the soliciting
material was either false or misleading in character or deficient in the
descriptive material called for by the proxy rules, communications
containing information, clarifying or supplementing the original
soliciting literature, were required to be sent to security holders.
Depending upon the character of the particular case, either new
proxies, consents, or authorizations were solicited or security holdens
were afforded an opportunity to revoke or confirm the proxies whiels
they had given. In other cases, in order to avoid the possibility of
failure to comply with such rules, proxies were not voted upon matters
which appeared either not to have been described or to have been
inadequately described in the soliciting literature.
In one case the management solicited approval of a managerial and
stock option contract entered into between the president of the corporation and the corporation, which contract provided for a substantial salary and for options to the president to purchase stock of the
corporation at a price to be calculated on the basis set forth in the
contract, and also requested the approval of purchases by the corporation of its own common stock. The Commission concluded after
examining the proxy soliciting material that such material did not
comply with the proxy rules in that it failed to disclose that the
president, by virtue of ownership of almost half of the outstanding
common stock, had practical control of the corporation at the- time
of making the contract and that no other member of the board 0f
directors owned any stock of the corporation so that in fact there' was
no bargaining between the corporation and the president ever the
terms of the contract. The material also failed to disclose that the
purchase price of the stock under the options calculated on the basis
provided in the contract was substantially below the market price of

70

SECURITIES

AND EXCHAKGE COMl\IISSIOK

the stock at the date of solicitation, so that under the contract, the
terms of which he had apparently dictated, the president was in a
position to realize a substantial profit on the stock options. The
material further failed to disclose that some of the purchases of stock
which the management desired to have ratified were made at private
-sales at varying prices, some of them as high as $20 a share over the
market price at the time of the purchase. The Commission required
that a further communication disclosing these facts and a form of
revocation or confirmation be sent to stockholders to enable them to
revoke or confirm their proxies on the basis of the subsequent information.
In another case the management solicited approval by stockholders
of the proposed dissolution of the company. In the course of such
solicitation a letter was sent to stockholders over the signature of the
president in which he urged both common and preferred stockholders
to vote in favor of the dissolution and in which he stated that he owned
six and one-half times as many shares of the common stock as he
owned of preferred. The Commission, after examining the material
used by the management, concluded that it failed to comply with the
proxy rules in that it gave no information from which an owner of
common stock could deduce that upon dissolution of the company
there would probably be no funds available for distribution to the
holders of the common stock, and in that the president neglected to
state that there were almost eight times as many shares of common
stock outstanding as there were preferred, so that in fact he had a
proportionately larger interest in the preferred stock than he had in
the common, although his statement that he owned six and one-half
times as many shares of common stock than of preferred was calculated
to lead stockholders to believe that his principal interest lay in
common stock.
The company refused, in the first instance, to send stockholders a
further communication disclosing these facts. When, however, it
appeared that the Commission would take action pursuant to the
authority conferred by Section 21 (e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and file a bill seeking an order restraining the use of the proxies
obtained from the management's solicitation, the company did send
a communication to stockholders containing the necessary information and also sent a form of confirmation to be used 'by stockholders
confirming proxies previously given. Only proxies confirmed or
obtained on the basis of the subsequent communication were voted
on the question of the dissolution of the company.
There was a substantial increase during the fiscal year in the number
of occasions on which corporate counselor other representatives of
management submitted proposed proxy soliciting material to the
Commission for comment in advance of its use.

FOURTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

71

Under Section 11 (g) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
-of 1935 solicitation of proxies or other authorizations in connection
with a reorganization plan of a registered holding company or a.
subsidiary is prohibited unless, among other things, the plan has been
proposed by the Commission or submitted to the Commission by a.
person having a bona fide interest in the reorganization and is accompanied or preceded by a copy of the Commission's report on the plan.
Under Section 12 (e) of the Act solicitation of proxies and other
authorizations regarding any securities of registered holding companies
.and their subsidiaries is prohibited except in accordance with the
Commission's rules, regulations or orders.
Pursuant to the provisions of these sections of the Act, the Commission, on July 26, 1937, adopted rules and regulations governing
the solicitation of proxies, deposits, consents, and dissents in respect
of securities of holding companies registered under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 or their subsidiaries.
These rules (Rules U-12E-1 through U-12E-6) may be divided into
two general catagories: First, the rules apply to the solicitation of
proxies, deposits, consents, and dissents from owners of securities of
registered holding companies and subsidiaries, in connection with
reorganization plans and for other similar purposes; second, the
rules make applicable the existing and other future rules with respect
to proxies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to certain solietations of a proxy regarding a security of a registered holding company
or subsidiary. Generally speaking, the rules set up standards to
which those soliciting proxies must conform. Such standards, for
instance, call for periodic accounting by protective committees,
prohibition against trading in securities by committee members and
detailed information through Commission reports to enable those
solicited for votes to act with some judgment.
More specifically, Rule U-12E-1 defines the terms used in the rules
adopted pursuant to Sections 11 (g) and 12 (e) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935. Rule U-12E-2 provides that no person shall solicit, with certain exceptions, any proxy regarding any
security of a registered holding company or a subsidiary thereof except
upon compliance with the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to
Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange .Act of 1934, which rules
would be applicable to such solicitation if "uch securities were registered on a national securities exchange.
Rule U-12E-3 deals with solicitation of authorizations in connection
with reorganizations. This rule imposes general requirements as to
the terms and conditions upon whir h such solicitations must be made.
Among such requirements are provisions for independent review and
determination of all fees and expenses, the submission of periodic
reports and statements of account, the prohibition of the buying or

72

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

selling of securities affected by the reorganization on behalf of the
persons making the solicitation, and the right to revoke such authorizations and to withdraw securities from deposit, without expense, priorto the exercise of the authorization.
The rule also deals with different
types of solicitation classified according to the scope of the solicitation
and the kind of authority solicited. Limited requirements are im~
posed in regard to solicitations from not more than 25 owners of securities and also from security holders without limit as to number which
are restricted to representation in connection with preliminary action
pertaining to such activities as the negotiation, formulation, or development of the plan, and the appearance before courts or commissions
where such action does not authorize consent to or dissent from a.
plan on behalf of the persons solicited. More comprehensive information is required to be submitted to the Commission and to security
holders in connection with solicitations of proxies or authorizations
which empower the persons making the solicitation to consent to ordissent from any plan of reorganization, whether such authorization
is granted upon condition or absolutely.
The use of deposit agreements and the deposit of securities is, in
effect, greatly curtailed by the rules. Deposits of securities may not
be solicited until after the plan has been prepared and the Commission
has made a report thereon, except in certain special circumstances.
where the Commission finds that the deposit of securities is necessary
in order to accomplish certain specified purposes such as the maintenance of actions at law or in equity for the protection of the rights of
the owners of such securities, the collection or distribution of payments
on account of securities, the tender of securities in connection with a
contemplated purchase of assets at a judicial or foreclosure sale, or
for other purposes found by the Commission to be in the interest ofsecurity holders.
Rules U-12E-4, 5, and 6 prescribe the form and content of applications for reports on plans and for declarations in connection with
solicitations to be made in accordance with Rule U-12E-3. These
rules require the statement of comprehensive information as to the.
terms of any plan, financial and other data relative to the fairness and
feasibility of a plan, the interests of persons composing or negotiatingthe plan and soliciting with respect to it, the basis upon which claims
for expenses and compensation are to be made, and description of themanner in which solicitations are to be made. Forms of agreements.
with security holders, authorizations and letters of solicitation and
other soliciting material are also required to be filed as exhibits.
It is expected that the general revision of the rules adopted under'
Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 referred to in
the Third Annual Report of the Commission will be promulgated early-

73-

in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939.31 This revision will be based

TREATMENT
OF APPLICATIONS,

REPORTS,

OR

Under the provisions of Section 24 (b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and the rules adopted thereunder, persons who object
to the public disclosure of information contained in any application,
report, or document filed by them with the Commission under that
Act may submit the confidential portion of such material to the.
Chairman of the Commission, together with an application stating
the grounds upon which the objection to public disclosure is based.
The Commission is empowered to grant or deny such application.
The Securities Act of 1933, as amended, also authorizes confidential
treatment by the Commission of material contracts filed in connection with registration statements where the disclosure of such contracts would impair their value and would not be necessary for the
protection of investors. Similarly, the Commission may act onapplications for confidential treatment of information in applications,
declarations, reports, or other documents filed under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.
During the year, 139 applications for the confidential treatment of
certain material were filed, involving a total of 195 separate items
of information, principally in connection with the annual reports of
such issuers filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Material filed by 298 applicants
involving 381 items of information (including applications pendingat the beginning of the fiscal year), was made available for public
inspection during the year, pursuant to Rule UB2 (which rule was.
redesignated as Rule X-24B-2 as of September 10, 1938),.the Commission having determined that disclosure of such information is in.
the public interest, or the applicants having withdrawn their objections to its public disclosure. Sixty-one applications for confidential
treatment (including a number pending from the previous year),
submitted by 35 applicants, involving 90 items of information, were
granted during the year and 56 private hearings on applications for
confidential treatment were held at the request of the various applicants.
Ii A complete revision of the rules and regulations relating to the solicitation of proxies, consents, or
authonsetrons with respect to securities registered on national securities exchanges was published by the
Oommission on August 11, 1938, drsignated as Regulation X-H. The new rules substantially broaden

Twenty-one applications for confidential treatment of material
contracts or portions thereof submitted in connection with registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
were submitted during the year, pursuant to Rule 580 under that
Act. Of these requests, 17 were granted in whole or in part, 1 was
denied, and 3 were withdrawn.
Twenty-two applications for confidential treatment of material
filed under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 were
received during the year, all of which applications were pending on
June 30, 1938.
At the beginning of the year, there were pending in several U. S.
Circuit Courts of Appeal 21 petitions filed by issuers seeking to
review determinations by the Commission denying applications for
confidential treatment.
During the year, 11 of these petitions were
dismissed on the motion of the petitioners, and the material involved
was made public. At the close of the year, it was expected that 3
of the remaining 10 petitions would be presently dismissed. Only
one petition for judicial review of the Commission's determinations
in such matters was filed during the fiscal year. Appendix VI,
Table 5, contains a summary of all confidential treatment cases
pending in the courts during the past fiscal year and their status as
of June 30, 1938.
REPORT

ON THE STUDY AND INVESTIGATION OF PROTECTIVE
REORGANIZATION
COMMITTEES

AND

During the past fiscal year the Commission has continued to report

to the Congress the results of its study and investigation of the work,
activities, personnel, and functions of protective and reorganization
committees, pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section
211 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This study was originally
under the general supervision of Chairman William O. Douglas and
during the last year under the supervision of Commissioner Jerome
Frank, with Abe Fortas as Assistant Director and Samuel O. Clark,
Jr., as Counsel.
Part VII of the Commission's report, which pertains to Management Plans Without Aid of Committees, was transmitted to the
Congress on May 10, 1938. This volume deals with so-called voluntary reorganizations and contains recommendations for legislative
action designed to correct the abuses prevalent in this field. In
addition to Part VII referred to above, the parts of this report which
have been completed and transmitted to the Congress are as follows:
I. Strategy and Techniques of Protective and Reorganization Committees.
Part II. Committees and Conflicts of Interest.
Part III. Committees for the Holders of Real Estate Bonds.
Part

FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

75

Part IV. Committees for the Holders of Municipal and
Quasi-Municipal Obligations.
Part V. Protective Committees and Agencies for Holders
of Defaulted Governmental Bonds.
Part VI. Trustees Under Indentures.
A final report, Part VIII, Conclusions and Recommendations, is
now in the process of completion. This volume includes an extensive
discussion of the law relating to corporate reorganizations and an
examination of recent legislative reforms in this field.
The basic recommendations contained in the various parts of the
report described above were embodied in three bills which were under
consideration by the 75th Congress: The Barkley Bill (S. 2344), the
Lea Bill (H. R. 6968), and Chapter X of the Chandler Bill (H. R.
6439, H. R. 8046). The last-named bill was sponsored by Congressman Walter Chandler in the House and Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney
in the Senate. This bill, which constitutes a comprehensive revision
of the National Bankruptcy Act, was enacted by the Congress and
approved by the President on June 22, 1938. Chapter X of this Act,
as now amended, effects a number of substantive and procedural
improvements in the corporate reorganization provisions previously
known as Section 77B and embodies many of the recommendations
made by this Commission to the Congress in Part I of the report in
question. Among the more important of these changes are the provisions which require the appointment of disinterested trustees in
every case of substantial size and which supply administrative assistance to the Federal Courts by placing the Commission's technical
facilities in business and financial matters at their disposal in reorganization cases under Chapter X. The court may invite or permit the
Commission to appear in any reorganization proceeding thereunder.
In addition, the court may, in any such reorganization proceeding,
refer reorganization plans to the Commission for an advisory report
thereon. Such reference is mandatory where liabilities of a debtor
corporation exceed $3,000,000. The Commission has authorized the
creation of a Reorganization Division in connection with the exercise
of its functions under this chapter.
The Barkley Bill (S. 2344), introduced on June 6, 1937, deals with
the corporate trustee and the trust indenture. It was favorably
reported by the Senate Banking and Currency Committee on April
19, 1938, and hearings on a companion bill (H. R. 10292), introduced
in the House of Representatives on April 18, 1938, were held before
the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Hearings were also held on the Lea Bill (H. R. 6968) before the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. This bill relates
generally to the solicitation of proxies, deposits, and assents in connection with reorganizations. Representatives of the Commission

COMPANIES

The Commission is completing its study of investment trusts and
investment companies, being conducted pursuant to Section 30 of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. This study and the
preparation of the reports have been under the general supervision of
Commissioner Robert E. Healy, with Paul P. Gourrich, Technical
Adviser to the Commission, as Director of the Study, the late William
R. Spratt, Jr., as Chief of the Study, David Schenker as Counsel and
L. M. C. Smith as Associate Counsel.
On June 11, 1938, the Commission transmitted Part One of its final
report to the Congress. This part of the report, consisting of three
chapters, deals with the origin, scope, and conduct of the study, the
nature and classification of investment companies, and the origins of
the investment company movement in this country.
Part Two of this final report, consisting of eight chapters containing
detailed analyses of statistical data, is practically completed. The
Commission will transmit these chapters to the Congress immediately
upon completion."
Both Part Three, dealing with the economic significance of investment companies and their control of industry, and Part Four, treating
with the abuses and defects in connection with investment companies,
as well as six supplemental reports relating respectively to fixed and
semi-fixed investment trusts, installment investment plans, companies
issuing face amount installment certificates, common or commingled
trust funds, investment counsel and investment advisory services,
and British management investment trusts, are nearing completion
and will be submitted to the Congress within the current fiscal year.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission conducted additional
public examinations on approximately 90 investment companies, at
which about 13,000 pages of testimony were taken and approximately 2,700 exhibits were introduced into evidence.
In addition, the Commission held a public conference with representatives of investment counsel and investment advisory services to
supplement the basic statistical information obtained from the replies
to the questionnaire prepared by these organizations.
The following are the names of the companies upon which public
inquiries were held during the past fiscal year:
"Volume I, Volume II, and Volume III covering the first five chapters of Part Two were transmitted too
the Congress on July 28,1938,September 19,1938,and October 31,1938,respectively.

MARGIN

REGULATIONS

Regulations T and U, dealing with margin requirements, were
promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System pursuant to Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
But responsibility for enforcement of Regulation T devolves upon the
Commission. Accordingly, the Commission has continued, with such
personnel as was available, its systematic inspection of the books and
records of firms carrying margin accounts for customers.
Following the revision of Regulation T, which became effective on
January 1, 1938, Commission representatives' visited the offices of
security dealers in selected vicinities throughout the country for the purpose of reviewing their methods of doing business. As a result of this
work the Commission was able to assist numerous dealers in securities
in arriving at a greater understanding of the requirements of Regulation T and other rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco Regional
Offices of the Commission are at present equipped to carry on margin
inspections on a small scale. These inspections cover the accounts
carried by members of the exchanges in these regions. The accounts
of non-member brokers and dealers subject to Regulation T are also
receiving such inspection as personnel limitations permit.
The results of these inspections have been made available to the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and in a number of
instances the Commission has referred these results to various exchanges for disciplinary action.

AND DECEPTIVE

PRACTICES

Market Surveillance

During the past fiscal year, the Commission rounded out its procedure for the systematic surveillance of trading in securities on ex-change markets for the purpose of detecting manipulative activity.

FOURTH

A.L~NUAL REPORT

81

At the close of the fiscal year, daily volume and price movements of
3,133 exchange issues were under continued observation." These
observations continue the routine established by the Commission for
scrutinizing the market action of securities in the light of developments affecting the general market and specific industries.
This routine is supplemented by special observations of securities
in the process of primary and secondary distribution, securities for
which any substantial options are outstanding and securities in which
unusual transactions by officers, directors, or principal stockholders
have been reported. Data serving as a basis for these observations
are secured from examination of the terms of offering of all registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933 pertaining to
securities traded on the exchange or convertible into any such security;
from reports furnished by the New York Stock Exchange and the
New York Curb Exchange of all essential facts of secondary distributions of securities traded on these exchanges where members are
required to submit their distribution plans to the exchange for approval; from reports furnished by these exchanges of all options of
which they were notified by their members; by examination of the
reports filed under Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act ot
1934 and Section 17 (a) (2) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935; from information furnished by members of the public;
and from other sources.
The Commission has also sought to extend its observation of securities traded in the over-the-counter markets. The methods used in
observing the market action of such securities are, in general, similar
to those employed in the case of securities traded on exchanges, but
even greater emphasis is placed upon the importance of market action
during distributions, and careful studies are made of all registration
statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933.
Trading Investigations

Trading investigations are conducted by the Commission for the
purpose of detecting the use of manipulative practices in connection
with the trading in securities registered on national securities exchanges. For reasons of policy the Commission keeps confidential.
the fact that trading in a security is under investigation lest knowledge
of the existence of such an investigation react adversely upon the issuer
or its securities. These investigations entail varying degrees of time
and effort. Some cases mey be disposed of after a short investigation.
In other cases it becomes necessary for the Commission to reconstruct
the market over an extended period of time.
In the conduct of these investigations the Commission frequently
finds it necessary to resort to the subpena power conferred upon it by
!I The figure given above includes some duplication, inasmuch as one issue traded on two exchanges Illtreated as two separate issues.

82

SECURITIES

AND EXOHANGE CO.Ml\IISSIO~

Section 21 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such cases
are classified as formal investigations. These are frequently preceded
by investigations which are conducted without the use of subpena
power and in that sense are informal in nature. To expedite its work,
the Commission divides informal cases into flying quizzes and preliminary investigations. The flying quiz is designed to detect and
discourage incipient manipulation by a prompt determination of the
causes for unusual market behavior. Often the results of a flying
quiz point to a legitimate reason for the activity under review and the
case is closed. Frequently they uncover facts which require a more
extended investigation, in which case a preliminary investigation is
undertaken.
During the fiscal year 66 flying quizzes were in progress, of which 19
developed into preliminary investigations and 35 were closed. There
were 12 flying quizzes still in process at the end of the year. On July
1, 1937, 48 preliminary investigations were in process. During the
fiscal year 27 such investigations were initiated and 40 were closed.
As the result of these preliminary investigations, 11 formal investigations were authorized. There were 24 preliminary investigations
pending at the end of the year. On July 1, 1937, 29 formal investigations were in process and during the year 14 new formal investigations
were authorized and 14 were closed, leaving 29 still in process at the
end of the year.
Thus, a total of 154 trading investigations were in progress throughout the year, of which 65 were pending at the end of the year. In
many of the 89 cases which were closed, evidence was obtained which
resulted in affirmative action by the Commission, the Department of
Justice, or national securities exchanges.
Disposition of Trading Cases

There are a number of remedies which the Commission may invoke
against persons who have violated the anti-manipulative provisions
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It may seek to enjoin the
persons complained of through the courts. It may refer the matter
to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, and it may also
take appropriate administrative action. Thus, if the respondent is a
member of a national securities exchange, proceedings may be instituted by the Commission under Section 19 (a) (3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to determine whether such member shall
be suspended for a period not exceeding 12 months or expelled from
the exchange. If the respondent is a registered broker-dealer
(whether a member of an exchange or a non-member) the Commission
may, pursuant to Section 15 (b) of such Act, conduct hearings to
determine whether such registration shall be revoked.
Since by the provisions of Section 6 (b) the rules of a registered
national securities exchange must include a provision for the expul-

sion, suspension, or disciplining of any member who wilfully violates
any provision of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or
regulation thereunder, the Commission may refer evidence of such
violation to the appropriate exchange for disciplinary action under its
rules.
During the past fiscal year, formal action was taken in a total of
15 cases of alleged violation of Section 9 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the provisions of which prohibit manipulation of security
prices. Five proceedings under Section 19 (a) (3) of the Act resulted
in the expulsion or suspension of members from exchanges; one
hearing for revocation of registration of a broker-dealer resulted in the
withdrawal of the registration; permanent injunctions were secured
in the courts in four cases; two convictions were secured in criminal
prosecutions conducted by the Department of Justice; another case
was referred to that department; and two references were made to
exchanges on evidence of violation of Section 9 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. These references resulted in the dissolution
of one firm, with an undertaking that certain partners of that firm
should not apply for membership in the exchange or partnership in any
member firm, and in the expulsion of one exchange member and the
suspension of another. A chronological record of action taken on
cases involving violation of Section 9 during the fiscal year ended
June 30,1938, follows: 34

On August 19, 1937, the Commission issued an order expelling
Michael J. Meehan from membership on the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Curb Exchange and the Board of Trade of the
City of Chicago. This action was based upon proceedings instituted
under Section 19 (a) (3) on October 26, 1935, which alleged violations
of Sections 9 (a) (1) and 9 (a) (2) in transactions in Ballanca Aircraft.
Corporation common stock on the New York Curb Exchange during
1935.
On August 7, 1937, E. L. Cord and Morris Markin consented to
being permanently enjoined by the U. S. District Court at Chicago
from further violations of Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. This action resulted from an investigation of the activities
and transactions of these persons in the securities of Checker Cab
Manufacturing Corp., Parmelee Transportation Co., and Chicago
Yellow Cab Co., and of Cord in Auburn Automobile Co. stock during
1935 and 1936.
On August 7, 1937, John R. Moore consented to being permanently
enjoined from further violations of Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933

following a bill of complaint entered in the U. S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Washington. This action resulted from an
investigation into the transactions of Moore, then an officer of the
National Company of Idaho, Inc., during March 1937 in Jack
Waite Mining Company common stock listed on the Standard Stock
Exchange of Spokane.
On October 8, 1937, Thomas F. Gagen, a member of the Boston
Stock Exchange consented to suspension as a member of that exchange
for 1 year beginning October 11, 1937. Gagen was a respondent in
proceedings which were instituted under Section 19 (a) (3) in May
1936, based on transactions on the Boston Stock Exchange in East
Boston Company capital stock during 1935. A hearing was ordered on
October 8, 1937, to determine whether the broker-dealer registration
of John L. Cronan, a former partner of Gagen and a participant in the
transactions complained of, should not be revoked. Cronan withdrew
his registration on January 5,1938.
On October 16, 1937, the Commission announced that as a result
of investigations conducted by the New York Stock Exchange, the
New York Curb Exchange and the Commission, the firm of Arnold &
Co., members of the New York Stock Exchange and associate members of the New York Curb Exchange, executed and delivered to the
New York Stock Exchange an undertaking to dissolve on or before
October 20, 1937. The undertaking stipulated that if any new firm
be formed, neither Roy W. Arnold nor Maurice Goodman, then
partners in Arnold & Co., will be partners of such firm. Roy W.
Arnold tendered his resignation as an associate member of the New
York Curb Exchange effective October 20, 1937. This action was
taken as a result of an investigation conducted by the Commission
late in 1936 and early in 1937 into their activities in connection with
transactions in the common stock of Pierce Governor 00., on the
New York Curb Exchange. Substantial evidence was adduced of
acts of members of this firm which indicated the existence of possible
violations of Sections 9 (a) (1),9 (a) (2) and 11 (d) (1) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. On April 8, 1937, the Commission authorized
the reference of this matter to both the New York Stock and New
York Curb Exchanges. Arnold & Co. withdrew their broker-dealer
registration on December 6, 1937.
On January 21, 1938, the U. S. District Court of Massachusetts
sentenced Morey Getz who pleaded guilty to violation of Section
9 (a) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to 1 year and 1 day.
His sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation. Two
indictments alleging such violation were brought on January 4, 1937,
in connection with his transactions in Suburban Electric Securities
Company common stock on the Boston Stock Exchange during 1936.
On February 4, 1938, the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the

FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT

Seventh Circuit affirmed the action of the District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois in enjoining R. J. Koeppe & Co. from
further violations of Section 9 (a) (1), (2), and (3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17 (a) (2) of the Securities Act of
1933. This case involved transactions of R. J. Koeppe in the common
stocks of Paducah Cooperage Co., Inc., and Wahl Company during
1935, the former security then registered on the Chicago Curb Exchange and the latter security registered on the Chicago Stock
Exchange
On February 28, 1938, Charles C. Wright, a member of the New
York Stock Exchange, the New York Curb Exchange, the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Board of
Trade of the City of Chicago, was expelled from such exchanges,
effective April 30, 1938. Norman Stern and Herbert King, members
of the New York Stock Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange,
were suspended from such exchanges for 1 year beginning April 30,
1938. This action resulted from proceedings initiated under Section
19 (a) (3) on February 27, 1936, based upon their transactions in the
common stock of Kinner Airplane & Motor Corp., Ltd., on the
Los Angeles Stock Exchange during 1935. An appeal to the U. S.
Circuit Court of Appeals by the respondent Wright is now pending.
On March 5, 1938, the U. S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York permanently enjoined 16 individuals and the firm of
Torr & Co. from further violations of Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17 (a) (1) of the Securities Act of
1933. This action was based upon an investigation of the transactions
during 1935 of these individuals in the common stock of Trans-Lux
Daylight Picture Screen Corporation, a registered security on the
New York Curb Exchange.
On May 12, 1938, the U. S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York sentenced seven individuals who pleaded guilty to fraud
and manipulation in the sale of the common stock of Standard Commercial Tobacco Company, General Bronze Corporation, and Cable
Electric Products, Inc. They received sentences of 1 year and 1 day,
and 2 years. The individuals operated as H. W. Schmid Co. and the
indictment which was brought on March 30, 1937, alleged violations
of Sections 9 (a) (1) and 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as well as violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the mail
fraud statutes.
On Ml1Y18, 1938, Gerald M. Loeb and Gordon B. Crary, partners
ofE. F. Hutton & Co., members of the New York Stock Exchange, the
New York Curb Exchange, the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago,
and the Los Angeles Stock Exchange, having resigned as partners
from that firm agreed, for a period of 10 and 8 months, respectively,
not to become a member of a national securities exchange, and not to

apply for registration as a broker or dealer, and not to become ft
partner, official or director, or branch manager of any registered
broker or dealer. Such action resulted from the institution of proceedings under Section 19 (a) (3) on December 31, 1937, against
these persons in connection with their transactions in the capital stock
of Auburn Automobile Company during 1935 and 1936.
On June 1, 1938, the Chicago Stock Exchange suspended W. S.
Mills, Jr., for a period of 1 year and expelled H. J. Mills. This action
was based upon a reference to the Exchange by the Commission of
information concerning certain transactions in 1937 in Backstay Welt
Company common stock, a security registered on the Chicago Stock
Exchange.
On June 21, 1938, the Commission by order suspended Faris R.
Russell, a partner of White, Weld & Co., for a period of 90 days from
August 21, 1938, from membership on the New York Stock Exchange,
the New York Curb Exchange, and the Board of Trade of the City of
Chicago. This action was based upon the institution of proceedings
under Section 19 (a) (3) on April 23, 1936, in connection with the
activities and transactions of White, Weld & Co. during 1935 in the
common stock of A. O. Smith Corporation, then a security registered
on the New York Curb Exchange.
On April 7, 1938, the Trial Examiner's report on the proceedingsinstituted under Section 19 (a) (3) against the firm of W. E. Hutton
and certain of its partners was filed with the Commission. Briefs in
support of the findings of the Trial Examiner, exceptions to such findings and briefs in support of such exceptions were filed on October 5;
1938. Reply briefs are to be filed by February 1, 1939, and February
8, 1939 has been set as the date for oral argument before the Commission.
Miscellaneous

As a result of trading investigations evidence was uncovered in
numerous instances of violations of other provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as well as of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the
rules and settled practices of national securities exchanges. Trading
investigations have sometimes resulted in the institution of stop order
proceedings under Section 8 (d), and examinations under Section 8 (e),
of the Securities Act of 1933. A notable instance occurring during the
past year was in the matter of Austin Silver Mining Company, in which
a stop order was entered by the Commission on July 13, 1938.
On June 27, 1938, stop order proceedings under Section 8 (d) were
instituted in the matter of Reiter-Foster Oil Co. as a result of facts
adduced in a trading investigation.
In numerous other instances the
facts uncovered by a trading investigation have resulted in the filing of
amendments to registration statements, the revision of reports filed
under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by officers;

FOUHTH A.N~UAL REPORT

87

directors, and principal stockholders, and in other ways have brought
about compliance with the provisions of these Acts.
Trading investigations have led to the institution of proceedings
for the purpose of enjoining continued violations of Section 8 (b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 17 of the SecuritiesAct of 1933. Thus, on February 4, 1938, upon application by theCommission, the U. S. District Court sitting in Philadelphia permanently enjoined John W. Fry of Philadelphia from the furthersale of securities in violation of the above sections. This action wasbased on facts developed during a trading investigation and as a
result John W. Fry & Co. withdrew its registration as broker-dealer.
During the fiscal year, a program for more vigilant administration of
national securities exchanges has been developed as narrated elsewhere in this report. In continuance of its former policy, the Commission has assisted national securities exchanges in their efforts to
enforce their own rules and in many instances matters have been
brought to the attention of national securities exchanges which, as fl,
result, have taken disciplinary action against members, who havebeen censured, fined, and in some cases suspended or expelled. In
one instance a specialist was fined by an exchange and required to
undo four trades. Disciplinary action of this character has been
predicated upon such matters as the failure of members to keep'
proper records, insolvency, violation of Regulation T of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, manipulative practices;
and other violations of exchange rules.
In addition, facts disclosed by trading investigations have indicated
the necessity for rules and regulations which have been adopted by
the Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and have influenced national securities exchanges to.
amend or supplement their own rules.
SPECIAL STUDIES AND THE PREPARATION OF RULES
Short Selling

.Although the problems relating to short selling have received
continuous attention from the Commission since its creation in 1934,
market conditions, until the past fiscal year, did not present an opportunity for first-hand current observation of short selling in severely
declining markets. The Commission used the opportunity afforded
by the sharp drop in prices in September and October of 1937 to make
a detailed study of transactions in 20 selected stocks listed on the
New York Stock Exchange during the periods of September 7 to 13r
inclusive, and October 18 to 23, inclusive.
As a result of this study the Commission issued Rules X-lOA-I,
X-lOA-2 and X-3B-3 on January 24, 1938, effective on February 8,
1938. The principal effect of these rules is to require that any short

88

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sale of a security must be made at a price above the last preceding
sale price. Since the issuance of Rule X-1OA-1, two exemptions
from its provisions have been adopted. On February 10, 1938, the
Commission allowed an exemption applicable to equalizing transactions on domestic exchanges; on April 8, 1938, certain arbitrage
transactions were exempted.
Subsequently, the Commission called for data similar to that which
provided the bases for its study of the market in September and
October of 1937. The same stocks which had been used at that time
were again subjected to detailed scrutiny for the period of March 21
to April 2, 1938, inclusive. This re-check of its data will permit the
Commission to judge the adequacy and effectiveness of its regulations.
Trading by Officers, Directors. and Principal Stockholders

At this time the Commission also instituted a study and review of
the effects of the requirements of Section 16 (a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. This section covers the trading by officers,
directors and principal stockholders in the securities of their own
companies. The Commission's study, which is still in process, covers
all reports filed with the Commission since this section of the Act
became applicable, in an effort to determine (a) the extent to which
this trading is carried on, (b) the price ranges of securities in which
there appears to be the greatest concentration of this type of trading,
(c) other characteristics of the securities in which this type of trading
appears to be concentrated, and (d) the extent to which the reduction
in this type of trading, resulting from the publicity requirements of
the statute, affected the general market.
Segregation

Continuing the procedure suggested in the Commission's report
on the Feasibility and Advisability of the Complete Segregation of
the Functions of Dealer and Broker," the Commission carried on
during the fiscal year the study of this problem and has prepared
drafts of rules to require the registration of members of certain
national securities exchanges as floor traders and to impose certain
limitations upon their activities; to limit securities positions of members' registered firms carrying margin accounts for customers; and to
require the filing of reports of all transactions of such firms. These
rules, in tentative form, have been sent to all exchanges for comment
and criticism. Discussions of the proposed rules have been instituted.
Further study has also been devoted to the activities of specialists,
with emphasis upon material which the N ew York Stock Exchange
assembled in cooperation with the Commission indicating the financial
resources of specialists. This information should enable the Commission to determine whether these resources are adequate to permit

specialists to perform their function in the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets in the securities in which they are registered.
Financial Safeguards-Richard

Whitney & Company

The efforts of the Commission continued to be directed toward the
creation of effective means of protecting customers from loss through
the insolvency of brokerage firms. In this connection, the failure of
the firm of Richard Whitney & Company, members of the New York
Stock Exchange, and the disclosures of misappropriations of customers' funds and securities by the senior partner demonstrated the
urgent necessity of more adequate regulation.
The investigation of the circumstances antecedent to and surrounding the failure of Richard Whitney and Company and the expulsion of Richard Whitney from the New York Stock Exchange
was, in this connection, one of the most significant ever undertaken
by the Commission. Richard Whitney had held the highest offices
in the New York Stock Exchange, having been Chairman of the
Business Conduct Committee, Vice President, and President for
several terms. At the time of his failure and exposure in March
1938, he was a member of the Governing Committee, a member of
the Law Committee, and Trustee of the Gratuity Fund.
The Securities and Exchange Commission received information
concerning Richard Whitney's misconduct and the financial distress
-of his firm during the evening of March 7, 1938, when these matters
were brought to its attention by Exchange officials. The Commission
ordered an immediate investigation on the morning of March 8, 1938.
On March 8,1938, the New York Stock Exchange suspended the firm
-of Richard Whitney and Company for insolvency and issued a statement indicating that Richard Whitney, senior partner of the firm, had
been guilty of misconduct. On March 17, 1938, Richard Whitney was
-expelled from the Exchange and two of his partners were suspended for
3 years. In the meantime, Richard Whitney had been indicted for
grand larceny in the first degree for appropriating to his own use securities entrusted to him in a fiduciary capacity. To these indictments he
pleaded guilty and, on April 11, 1938, was sentenced to a term of
from 5 to 10 years in Sing Sing Prison.
In order to determine the necessity for additional legislation or rules
or regulations for the protection of investors and brokerage customers
the Commission on April 6, 1938, ordered that a public hearing be
held pursuant to Section 21 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
to ascertain the facts, conditions, practices, and matters antecedent
to and culminating in the failure of Richard Whitney and Company.
Fifty-two witnesses, all officials, members, or partners of members
of the New York Stock Exchange, or Commission experts, testified
during the course of the hearings, which began on April 8, 1938, and
ended on June 29, 1938. Throughout. these proceedings the Exchange
104139-39--7

90

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

was represented by counsel, as were all witnesses who desired counsel.
The printed record of the proceedings comprises 937 pages of testimony
and over 100 exhibits."
On February 23, 1938, after extensive study by the Commission's
staff, a draft of tentative rules and forms pursuant to Section 8 (b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was sent to exchanges, accountants, and other experts in brokerage accounting for comment and
criticism. These proposed rules limit the aggregate indebtedness of
brokers to a fixed percentage of their net capital. Numerous conferences have been held with exchange officials and accounting experts
and the suggestions submitted to the Commission are being considered
preparatory to the issuance of a revised draft of rules and forms.
On March 17,1938, the Commission submitted to all exchanges and
organizations of over-the-counter brokers and dealers a list of questions
relating to the suggestion to require brokers and dealers to furnish the
Commission and all customers periodic statements of their financial
condition. The Commission received in response numerous suggestions which are now under consideration.
Rules have also been drafted pursuant to the provisions of Section
8 (c) of the Act concerning the hypothecation and commingling of
customers' securities by brokers.
On May 20, 1938, the Chairman of the Commission, discussing
problems of security of customers' property, publicly urged the New
York Stock Exchange to study means further to prevent misuse of
customers' funds and securities, and suggested as one device the
creation of a central trust institution to assume the functions of banking, clearing of securities, and the custodial duties of all members of the
Exchange. The Commission's staff has given a considerable amount
of time to joint exploration with Exchange officials of the possibilities
of establishing such an institution.
Other devices to serve as financial
safeguards of brokerage solvency have also been under consideration.
Margins

The Commission assisted the staff of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System in the revision of Regulation T which became.
effective January 1, 1938. The Commission's staff also conferred
with members of the Board's staff with respect to the formulation of
a procedure for the inspection of banks, relative to conformity with
Regulation U. The Commission's investigation of Richard Whitney

Miscellaneous

Exchange Studies and Rules

The Commission, during the fiscal year, sent to representative groups,
two successive drafts of rules under Section 9 (a) (6) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, prescribing practices to be followed in connection with pegging, fixing, and stabilizing the price of registered securities. The first draft, dated January 3, 1938, was thoroughly revised
on the basis of suggestions made by representative banks, investment
bankers, underwriters, stock exchange members, and stock exchanges
themselves, as well as by the Investment Bankers Association, the
Investment Bankers Conference, Inc., and the New York Security
Dealers Association. Subsequently this revision was made the basis
of a shorter draft of rules applicable to a limited number of situations
and this draft, dated June 27, 1938, was again sent to representatives
oftheindustry on July 1,1938.
Rules under Section 17 (a), requiring the maintenance of specific
records by brokers and dealers, have been prepared in an effort to
codify the best brokerage accounting procedure now employed by
representative exchange members. The value of these rules lies
chiefly in the establishment of uniform bookkeeping for non-member
brokers and dealers, some of whom have been found by the Commission to maintain their records in an unbusinesslike manner.
Additional projects for study of matters relating to exchange
procedure have included a survey of the odd-lot business, a study of
trading procedure on the London Stock Exchange, a study of British
methods of security distribution, a statistical analysis of commission
rates on domestic exchanges, and an investigation of the problems of
business solicitation by exchange members.
Over-the-Counter

Studies

The Commission's general examination of the problem of establishing adequate supervision over the business of brokers and dealers
doing business in the over-the-counter market, has, as has already
been noted, served as a basis for the new legislation which became
effective on June 25, 1938.37 However, another study of majorimportance on the machinery for the collection, publication and
dissemination of quotations and transactions for securities dealt in
in the over-the-counter market was also begun. The Commission
has also turned its attention to the creation of financial safeguards forcustomers dealing with non-member brokers and dealers in order toassure to such customers a degree of protection against insolvency and
malfeasance comparable to that afforded customers of exchange
member firms.

ADMISSION

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

AS ATTORNEY
COMMISSION

OR AGENT BEFORE

THE

On June 25, 1938, the Commission adopted Amended Rules of
Practice, effective July 1, 1938,38which revoked and replaced all
previously adopted Rules of Practice. Rule II of the Amended Rules
of Practice, which rule pertains to appearance and practice before
the Commission, does not provide for the formal admission of any
person to practice before the Commission, nor does it provide for the
maintenance of a register such as the one established November 1,
1935, in which were entered the names and addresses of all persons
admitted to practice before the Commission.
Under Rule II, as amended, practice before the Commission has
been defined to include the preparation of any statement, opinion,
or other paper by any attorney, accountant, engineer, or other expert,
filed with the Commission in any registration statement, application,
or other document with the consent of such attorney, accountant,
engineer, or other expert. Therefore, all persons who present cases
before the Commission, or who prepare material to be filed with the
Commission are regarded as practicing before the Commission. Any
person may be disqualified and denied, temporarily or permanently,
the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission in
any way, if such person is found, after a hearing in the matter, not to
possess the requisite qualifications to represent others or to be lacking
in character or integrity or to have engaged in unethical or improper
professional conduct. Thus, persons preparing statements, opinions,
and other papers filed with the Commission, as set forth above, are
subject to disqualification and disbarment to the same extent as those
appearing before the Commission in person.
Prior to July 1, 1938, the Rules of Practice provided for the admission to practice as Attorney or Agent before the Commission of those
persons who filed applications therefor and were found by the Commission to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others
before it. Inasmuch as the Commission no longer requires formal
admission to practice and has discontinued the above mentioned
register, the enrollment of all persons admitted to practice terminated
July 1, 1938, and those persons have been so informed. The Commission has also informed those persons whose applications for
admission to practice before it were pending at the time the Rules of
Practice were amended that, in view of the foregoing, their applications
had been filed without further action.
The following statistics indicate the number of applications received
since the register referred to above was established (November 1,
1935), and prior to its abolishment (July 1, 1938), the number of persons admitted to practice, and the number of applications pending as
of June 30,1938 .

With respect to practice before the Commission by former members
of the staff of the Commission, or by persons employing the services
of former members of the staff, the Commission has issued the
following statement:
"Under the amended Rules of Practice any former member
of the staff of the Commission who shall appear in a representative capacity in any matter, including an investigation
conducted by the Commission, which was pending before the
Commission during the period of his employment and with
which matter he has, by virtue of his employment with the
Commission, such familiarity as to be prejudicial to the proper
conduct of the case, or in which matter he acted for the Commission in such a way as to make unethical his subsequent
connection therewith, and any person employing the services
of any such former member of the staff in such matters, without
first obtaining the consent of the Commission, may be held to
be lacking in proper professional conduct."
PUBLIC REFERENCE

ROOMS

During the past year, the facilities in the Public Reference Room of
the Commission at Washington, D. C., were utilized by more than
10,200 members of the public seeking information from registration
statements, applications, reports, declarations, and other documents
filed with the Commission and available for public inspection. As in
previous years, thousands of letters and telephone calls were received
.from members of the public requesting registered information. The

94

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Commission, through the facilities provided for the sale of public
registered information, filled more than 3,500 orders for photocopies
of material, involving 249,160 pages.

SPECIAL RULES AS TO THE USE OF FORM A-2 FOR CORPORATIONS

1. Notwithstanding that Form E-l is specifically prescribed for
use in cases involving an exchange of securities by the issuer thereof
for others of its securities or a modification of the terms of securities
by agreement between the issuer and its security holders, a registrant
-otherwise entitled to use Form A-2 may, at its option, use Form
A-2 in any such case if the registrant is not in reorganization pur-

FOURTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

115

euant to Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act or in bankruptcy or
receivership and if no default exists on any outstanding funded
-debt (other than a default in sinking fund payments which has been
waived by the holders of at least 80 percent in principal amount of
the issue outstanding). If Form A-2 is used pursuant to this rule,
the fee payable for registration shall be calculated in accordance
with Instruction 7 in Form E-I, and the table setting forth the
calculation shall be prepared as prescribed in such form.
2. Form A-2 may be used by a registrant if all the following
'Conditions exist:
(a) The registrant was organized as the successor to a single predecessor, or to a group of predecessors one of which, at the time of
succession, directly or indirectly owned substantially all of the outstanding stock of all the other predecessors;
(b) The registrant acquired all of the assets and assumed all of
the liabilities of such predecessor or predecessors, and the capital
structure of the registrant immediately following the succession was
substantially the same as the capital structure of the single predecessor, or as the consolidated capital structure of the group of predecessors, except for such changes as may have resulted from the substitution of issuers incident to the succession or from changes in capital
stock liability per share; and
(c) The single predecessor, or the parent company in a group of
predecessors, could have used Form A-2 if the succession had not
taken place.
In determining whether such single predecessor or such parent
-company in a group of predecessors could have used Form A-2, the
record of the registrant in regard to income or annual reporting to
security holders shall be considered a continuation of the record of
such single predecessor or such parent company. In the case of a
group of predecessor companies, the income of the parent company
-of the group shall be determined on the basis of consolidated reports
for such parent company and its subsidiaries, the subsidiaries to be
included in the consolidated reports whether or not they were combined with the parent company to form the registrant.

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of the last sentence of the rule
for the use of Form A-2 for corporations, that form may be used
by a corporation otherwise entitled to use the form, if the property
acquired from promoters under the circumstances stated in such last
sentence consisted principally of one or more going businesses, or of
securities representing directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of
the voting power controlling such businesses.
4. Notwithstanding the rules as to the use of Form E-I, or the
rule as to the use of Form A-2 for Corporations, Form A-2 may
be used in the situation described below for registration statements,
except those for which a special form (other than Form E-I) is
specifically prescribed, by corporations which file profit-and-loss
:statements of their own or of their predecessors for 3 years and which,

116

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

or the predecessors of which, have in the past 15 years paid dividends:
upon any class of common stock for at least 2 consecutive years.
The situation in which Form A-2 may thus be used is that of registration of securities issued or sold in the course of a "reorganization,"
as defined in Rule 5 (1) as to the use of Form E-l, where the only
operation which brings the transaction within the definition is the
acquisition of assets of a subsidiary by the registrant in consideration
of securities of the registrant, or the exchange of securities of the
registrant for outstanding securities of a subsidiary,"
5. Any corporation which was formed by the consolidation of twoor more corporations may use Form A-2, if each of the constituent
corporations which collectively brought in a majority of the assets,
as shown by the books of the constituent corporations prior to the
consolidation, could have used Form A-2 if the consolidation had
not taken place. In determining whether any such constituent corporation could have used Form A-2, the record of the registrant in
regard to income or annual reporting to security holders shall be
considered a continuation of such constituent corporation's record.
In this rule, all the corporations consolidated to form the registrant
are called the "constituent corporations."
6. Form A-2 may be used by a registrant if all the following
conditions exist:
(a) The registrant was a wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation
which, either alone or with one or more of its other wholly owned
subsidiaries, was merged into the registrant;
(b) The registrant acquired all the assets and assumed all the
liabilities of the corporations merged into it; and
(c) The parent corporation could have used Form A-2 had the
merger not taken place. In determining whether such parent corporation could have used Form A-2, the record of the registrant
subsequent to the merger, in regard to income or annual reporting
to security holders, shall be considered a continuation of the record
of such parent corporation.
7. Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause (b) of the rule as to
the use of Form A-2 for corporations, this form may be used by a
corporation which has had a net income for only 1 fiscal year of the
5 fiscal years preceding the date of the latest balance sheet filed
with the registration statement, if(1) The corporation was organized at least 5 years prior to the
date of filing;
(2) Total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries, after deducting valuation and qualifying reserves, amount to not more than
$5,000,000, as shown by the most recent balance sheets filed with the
registration statement; and
• Rule 5 (1) defining the term "reorganization" is set forth below under the caption "Form E-l forSeeurttres in Reorganization."

APPENDIX vm
CROSS-REFERENCE
TABLE TO THE GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

The printed compilation of General Rules and Regulations under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended to and including
September 10, 1938, contains a new system of rule designation and
arrangement.
The following table indicates the designations under
which the rules appeared in previous mimeograph compilations and
the corresponding designations in the new printed compilation.
Rules LAI to LA7, inclusive, were not included in the new printed
compilation because they would cease to be effective on October 1,
1938, except as to any subject matter or meeting as to which the first
solicitation was made prior to such date. The new proxy rules,
Regulation X-14 (Rules X-14A-l to X-14A-9 and Schedule 14A),
which were published August 11, 1938, in release No. 1823, have been
included in the new printed compilation.
