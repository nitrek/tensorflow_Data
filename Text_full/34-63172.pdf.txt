ORDER APPROVING PLAN
OF DISTRIBUTION

On January 10, 2005, the Commission issued an Order instituting settled
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Southwest Securities, Inc.,
Daniel R. Leland, Kerry M. Rigdon, and Kevin J. Marsh (collectively, “Respondents”)
in this matter (“Order”). In the Matter of Southwest Securities, Inc., et al., Admin. Proc.
File No. 3-11793, Exchange Act Release No. 51002 (January 10, 2005). In the Order,
the Commission authorized the establishment of a Fair Fund, comprised of $10,276,002
in disgorgement, interest, and penalties paid by Respondents, plus accumulated interest,
for distribution to mutual funds affected by certain market timing trading allowed by
Respondents. The Fair Fund monies are to be distributed pursuant to a distribution plan
(the “Plan”).
On September 1, 2010, the Commission published a “Notice of Proposed Plan
of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment” (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103
(Exchange Act Release No. 62809). The Notice advised interested parties that they
could obtain a copy of the Plan from the Commission’s public website, or by requesting
one from Stephen Webster, Assistant Regional Director, Fort Worth Regional Office.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Plan could
submit their written comments no later than 30 days after the date of the Notice to the
Office of the Secretary, by using the Commission’s Internet comment form, or by emailing rule-comments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the Plan.

The Plan provides for distribution of the Fair Fund to eligible mutual funds that
were harmed by the actions of certain market timers that Respondents permitted to
market time. The Plan describes the procedures to be used to identify the eligible
mutual funds that will receive distributions. The Plan further describes the procedures
to be used to calculate and distribute the amounts to be paid to the eligible mutual
funds. Eligible mutual funds will not be required to make a claim or submit
documentation to establish their eligibility.
The Plan also proposed, and the Commission appointed, Gilardi and Co., L.L.C.
as the Fund Administrator in an Order issued on September 1, 2010 (Exchange Act
Release No. 62810). In the September Order, the Commission also waived the bond
requirement of the Fund Administrator for the good cause shown in the Plan. The Plan
sets forth, among other things, procedures for the administration of the Fair Fund,
including a proposed timeframe for the termination of the Plan.
The Fair Fund is held at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and will be
disbursed by Treasury. All distributions in this matter will be made by the Treasury’s
Financial Management Service (“FMS”) directly to the eligible mutual funds, with no
handling of money by the Fund Administrator or any non-governmental entity. The
payees, and the relative amounts to be paid by FMS to each, will have been reviewed
and approved by the Commission prior to the distributions.
The staff requested that the Commission approve the Plan. The Commission
finds that the Plan provides for an appropriate distribution of the monies paid by
Respondents pursuant to the Order.
Accordingly, pursuant to Fair Fund Rule 1104, it is hereby ORDERED that the
Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
