In the Matter of the Application of
STEPHEN GRIVAS
For Review of Disciplinary Action Taken by
FINRA

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
REGISTERED SECURITIES ASSOCIATION—REVIEW OF DISCIPLINARY
PROCEEDINGS
Conversion
Associated person of member firm of registered securities association converted funds of
an investment fund he managed and transferred those funds to the broker-dealer with
which he was associated in order to cure the broker-dealer’s net capital deficiency. Held,
association’s findings of violation and imposition of sanctions are sustained.
APPEARANCES
Martin P. Unger of Wexler Burkhart Hirschberg & Unger LLP for Stephen Grivas.
Alan Lawhead, Jennifer Brooks, and Gary Dernelle for FINRA.
Appeal filed: August 14, 2015
Last brief received: January 6, 2016
Stephen Grivas was formerly associated with Obsidian Financial Group, LLC (“Obsidian
Financial”), a former FINRA member firm. Grivas seeks review of a FINRA disciplinary action
based on his alleged violation of FINRA Rule 2010, which requires that FINRA members must,
“in the conduct of [their] business, observe high standards of commercial honor and just and

2
equitable principles of trade.”1 FINRA found that Grivas violated Rule 2010 by taking $280,000
from an investment fund he managed and transferring that money to the broker-dealer with
which he was associated to cure the broker-dealer’s net capital deficiency. As a result of this
violation, FINRA barred Grivas from association with any FINRA member firm.
On appeal, Grivas does not dispute that he transferred the funds or that he did so without
authorization. Instead, he principally argues that his alleged misconduct was not actionable
under Rule 2010 because it was not “in the conduct of [his] business” as an associated person of
a broker-dealer.2 Based on our independent review of the record, we sustain FINRA’s finding of
violation and the bar imposed. We find that Grivas violated Rule 2010 because his businessrelated conduct—the conversion of funds—reflected a failure to observe the high standards of
commercial honor required of registered persons.
I.

FACTS
A.

Grivas’s background.

Grivas entered the securities industry in 1992 and became associated with Obsidian
Financial in April 2008. Obsidian Financial is owned by Obsidian Capital Holdings, LLC
(“Obsidian Holdings”), of which Grivas is an approximately 25 percent shareholder and
managing member.
Obsidian Financial ceased operating a securities business in February 2013 and was
expelled from FINRA membership on October 16, 2013, for failure to file a quarterly financial
report. Grivas is not currently associated with any FINRA member firm.3
B.

Grivas formed the Fund to purchase restricted shares of Facebook stock.

In May 2011, Grivas formed Obsidian Social Networking Fund I, LLC (“the Fund”). As
set out in its private placement memorandum (“PPM”), the purpose of the Fund was to purchase
shares of Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”) stock prior to Facebook’s anticipated initial public
offering. In May 2011, Grivas also formed Obsidian Social Networking Management, LLC
(“Obsidian Management”) to act as the Fund’s manager. Grivas was the manager and sole
1

This requirement also applies to associated persons. See FINRA Rule 0140(a)
(“Persons associated with a member shall have the same duties and obligations as a member
under the Rules.”).
2

Grivas objects that he did not receive portions of the record on appeal, and, as a result, he
cited to entire documents rather than specific pages in the record. Grivas, however, concedes
that he has received an index of the record as required by Commission Rule of Practice 420(e).
See 17 C.F.R. § 201.420(e). Grivas’s citations have not affected our review of his appeal.
3

Grivas was suspended from associating with any member firm on October 29, 2013, for
failure to comply with an arbitration award or settlement agreement or to satisfactorily respond
to a FINRA request to provide information concerning the status of his compliance with the
arbitration award or settlement agreement.

member of Obsidian Management. The PPM and the operating agreement for the Fund indicated
that Obsidian Management owed a fiduciary duty to the Fund. Obsidian Management retained
Stacy Marcus and her company, Social Strategy LLC, as a consultant to the Fund. Marcus and
her company were hired to, among other things, locate Facebook stock for the Fund and maintain
spreadsheets tracking the Fund’s assets and costs.
The Fund offered and sold interests in the Fund through Obsidian Financial and two other
broker-dealers. The Fund began collecting investments in September 2011. By the time the
offering closed in March 2012, the Fund had raised $11,202,305 from 54 investors, 24 of whom
were existing Obsidian Financial customers.
The Fund used the proceeds of the offering to purchase 260,000 shares of Facebook on
April 4 and 17, 2012, at a cost of $9,976,750. Because of the limited availability of Facebook
shares in the secondary market, the Fund was not able to use all the money it had raised to invest
in Facebook shares. Thus, after paying Obsidian Management’s management fee, as well as
other expenses, the Fund still had $297,094 remaining as of May 18, 2012. Pursuant to the terms
of the PPM, the Operating Agreement, and the parties’ understanding, these funds were to be
distributed to members minus any remaining fees and reserves.
C.

Grivas transferred $280,000 from the Fund to Obsidian Financial.

Obsidian Financial began experiencing net capital difficulties by May 2012.4 To cure the
deficiency, Grivas transferred $280,000 from the Fund to Obsidian Financial. On June 14, 2012,
Grivas first wired $280,000 from the Fund to Obsidian Management. Grivas then transferred the
funds to Olympus Capital Group (“Olympus”), an entity that Grivas owned and which he used
for personal investment purposes. Later on June 14th, Grivas wired $280,000 from Olympus to
Obsidian Holdings, Obsidian Financial’s parent. The following day, Grivas wired $280,000
from Obsidian Holdings to Obsidian Financial.
On June 15, 2012, the same day it received the $280,000 of Fund money, Obsidian
Financial submitted a Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) Rule 17a-11(b)
notification to FINRA and the Commission stating that the firm had a net capital deficiency of
$110,000 during the period of May 15, 2012, through June 15, 2012. The notification further
stated that Obsidian Financial was now in capital compliance because it had received a capital
contribution of $280,000 on June 15, 2012.
D.

Grivas failed to notify Fund investors of the transfer.

Grivas did not tell anyone that he planned to withdraw $280,000 from the Fund and
transfer it to Obsidian Financial. Grivas also did not disclose the transfer to anyone after it had
occurred or make any notation of the transfer in any of the Fund’s books and records.

4

Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 establishes certain net capital requirements that all
broker-dealers must have and maintain.

4
Marcus and her company maintained spreadsheets that kept track of the assets and
expenses for the Fund. On multiple occasions after June 14, 2012, Marcus sent these
spreadsheets to Grivas to review. Grivas knew that Marcus relied on the amounts in these
spreadsheets when communicating with Fund members about the expected amount of their
refunds. Yet Grivas never informed Marcus that, because of his withdrawal, the amount in the
Fund’s operating account was $280,000 less than indicated on her spreadsheets.
E.

FINRA investigated Grivas and Grivas repaid the Fund.

In June 2012, FINRA’s Department of Enforcement (the “Department”) began an
investigation of Obsidian Financial. As part of this investigation, both Grivas and Marcus
appeared for on-the-record testimony (“OTR”). On February 20, 2013, the day before Marcus’s
OTR and over eight months after the $280,000 transfer, Grivas told Marcus for the first time that
Obsidian Management had withdrawn $280,000 from the Fund’s operating account. On May 8,
2013, two months after his OTR and almost eleven months after the $280,000 transfer, Grivas
repaid the $280,000 into the Fund’s operating account.
F.

FINRA found that Grivas violated FINRA Rule 2010 and barred Grivas
from the securities industry.

On April 30, 2013, the Department filed a single-cause complaint against Grivas alleging
that he had converted $280,000 from the Fund to meet the regulatory capital requirements of
Obsidian Financial in violation of FINRA Rule 2010. The Hearing Panel issued its decision on
February 14, 2014, finding that Grivas had converted monies of the Fund in violation of FINRA
Rule 2010 and barring Grivas from the securities industry.5
On appeal, FINRA’s National Adjudicatory Counsel (“NAC”) affirmed the Hearing
Panel’s findings and the sanctions it imposed. The NAC barred Grivas from association with
any FINRA member firm in any capacity for his violation of Rule 2010 and found that this
sanction appropriately fell within the FINRA Sanction Guidelines. This appeal followed.
II.

Analysis
A.

Standard of Review

We base our findings on an independent review of the record and apply the
preponderance of the evidence standard for self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) disciplinary
actions.6 Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 19(e)(1), in reviewing an SRO disciplinary action,
we determine whether the aggrieved person engaged in the conduct found by the SRO, whether

Grivas was also ordered to pay hearing costs of $5,649.95.

See David M. Levine, Exchange Act Release No. 48760, 2003 WL 22570694, at *2, *9
n.42 (Nov. 7, 2003).

5
such conduct violates the SRO’s rules, and whether such SRO rules are, and were applied in a
manner, consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.7
B.

Grivas engaged in the conduct found by FINRA.

We find that Grivas engaged in the conduct found by FINRA. As described above, the
record establishes, and Grivas does not dispute, that he intentionally withdrew $280,000 from the
Fund and transferred it through several intermediaries to Obsidian Financial to cure that firm’s
net capital deficiency. Grivas was not authorized to withdraw money from the Fund for the
purpose of transferring it to Obsidian Financial; furthermore, it was not his money, nor was he
entitled to possess it.
C.

Grivas’s conduct violated FINRA Rule 2010.

We agree that Grivas’s conduct violated FINRA Rule 2010, which requires that
associated persons, in the conduct of their business, “observe high standards of commercial
honor and just and equitable principals of trade.” This Rule is “designed to enable [FINRA] to
regulate the ethical standards of its members”8 and “encompass[es] business-related conduct that
is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, even if that activity does not involve a
security.”9 In determining whether conduct violates Rule 2010, the Commission examines
whether the wrongdoing reflects on the associated person’s capacity “to comply with the
regulatory requirements of the securities business and to fulfill [his or her] fiduciary duties in
handling other people’s money.”10
Grivas’s conduct fits within the broad range of misconduct proscribed by Rule 2010. His
intentional and unauthorized transfer of money from the Fund to his broker-dealer constituted an
act of conversion, which we have consistently found to violate Rule 2010.11 Conversion is
defined under FINRA’s Sanction Guidelines as the “intentional and unauthorized taking of

See, e.g., John M. E. Saad, Exchange Act Release No. 62178, 2010 WL 2111287, at *4-5
(May 26, 2010), rev’d on other grounds and remanded, 718 F.3d 904 (D.C. Cir. 2013). FINRA
Rule 2010 has the same wording and maintains the requirements previously contained in the
National Association of Securities Dealers’ (“NASD”) Rules of Fair Practice Article III, Section
1, and later NASD Conduct Rule 2110. Commission precedent addressing these provisions is
equally applicable to the Commission’s consideration of charges under Rule 2010.

6
and/or exercise of ownership over property by one who neither owns the property nor is entitled
to possess it.”12 Grivas’s conduct meets each element of this definition. First, Grivas’s transfer
of money from the Fund to Obsidian Financial was intentional. He incurred additional time and
effort to transfer the money through a series of intermediaries before the money was received by
Obsidian Financial. Second, Grivas’s transfer was not authorized. We note that he took pains to
conceal the transfer through the use of intermediaries and told no one, including Marcus, about
the transactions. Finally, the record supports a finding that the $280,000 did not belong to
Grivas nor was he “entitled to possess it.” Therefore, we find, as did FINRA, that Grivas’s
transfer of funds from the Fund to Obsidian Financial constituted conversion.
Grivas’s conversion of Fund assets was in the conduct of his business as required for a
violation of Rule 2010. The conversion directly concerned and affected his broker-dealer,
Obsidian Financial, by permitting the firm to cure a net-capital deficiency and continue to
operate.13
Grivas contends that the unauthorized withdrawal involved only the Fund, Obsidian
Management, and Grivas. According to Grivas, this conduct therefore does not fall within Rule
2010’s scope because it does not involve his investment banking or securities business as an
associated person.14 This view of the facts is far too narrow.15 The initial transfer from the Fund
12

See FINRA Sanction Guidelines (Mar. 2015 ed.) (“Guidelines”) at 36 & n.2. The
Commission has previously used this definition in evaluating FINRA disciplinary actions under
Rule 2010 and its predecessors. See, e.g., Denise M. Olsen, Exchange Act Release No. 75838,
2015 WL 5172954, at *4 n.19 (Sept. 3, 2015); John Edward Mullins, Exchange Act Release No.
66373, 2012 WL 423413, at *8 (Feb. 10, 2012). Grivas asserts that the Commission should
instead rely on common law definitions of conversion that have previously been referenced by
the NAC in its decisions. As Grivas concedes, however, his transfer of assets from the Fund
would equally satisfy these common law definitions of conversion.
13

See West, 2015 WL 137266, at *8 (sustaining finding that associated person violated
Rule 2010 predecessor by misusing customer funds to pay member firm’s operating expenses).
14

In support of this asserted limitation on Rule 2010, Grivas cites mainly cases examining
the scope of FINRA’s arbitration rules. But this disciplinary proceeding is governed by
FINRA’s Code of Procedure, not its Code of Arbitration Procedure. Nor does Grivas explain
why limits on the scope of FINRA’s arbitration rules apply to the scope of Rule 2010, given Rule
2010’s broad focus on the ethical standards of FINRA members and associated persons.
15

Grivas alternatively frames his argument as challenging FINRA’s jurisdiction over the
subject matter of this proceeding. His argument, however, is more appropriately understood as
addressing whether the facts alleged are actionable under Rule 2010. See Morrison v. National
Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 253-54 (2010) (“[T]o ask what conduct § 10(b) reaches is to
ask what conduct § 10(b) prohibits, which is a merits question. Subject-matter jurisdiction, by
contrast, refers to a tribunal’s power to hear a case. It presents an issue quite separate from the
question whether the allegations the plaintiff makes entitle him to relief.”) (internal citations and
quotation marks omitted). As in Morrison, whether FINRA may appropriately sanction a
member or associated person for conduct that it finds violates Rule 2010 is a merits question.

7
to Obsidian Management must be understood in its broader context, as the first step in the
transfer from the Fund to Obsidian Financial to meet that member firm’s net capital requirement.
Grivas should not benefit from the fact that he did not transfer the converted funds directly and
instead used multiple intermediaries he controlled. Instead, this indirect transfer of funds
suggests that Grivas was trying to hide the conversion and that he knew the conduct was
prohibited. In any event, the ultimate purpose of the conversion was to benefit Obsidian
Financial and thus the conversion was squarely within the conduct of Grivas’s business.
Even if Grivas’s asserted limitation on the universe of relevant facts was correct, Grivas’s
conversion of money from an investment fund would itself satisfy Rule 2010’s requirement that
the misconduct be in the conduct of Grivas’s business. Grivas acted as the Fund’s manager
through Obsidian Management. His management of the Fund and conversion of fund assets in
breach of his fiduciary duty to the Fund is business-related conduct, even if that management
was not of a FINRA member firm.16 Among other reasons, the Fund and the FINRA member
firm, Obsidian Financial, were interrelated: Obsidian Financial served as one of the brokers for
the Fund’s offering and 24 members of the Fund were customers of Obsidian Financial at the
time they invested in the Fund.
Grivas is also incorrect that the misconduct must bear a “close relationship” to the
associated person’s “investment banking or securities business.” This language is not in Rule
2010 and is contrary to the precedent interpreting that rule.17 Nor must the conduct relate to the
associated person’s customers18 or to a securities transaction19 in order to be covered by Rule
(. . . continued)
There is no dispute that FINRA has jurisdiction over a registered representative associated with a
member firm or that FINRA has jurisdiction to discipline associated persons. See 15 U.S.C.

2010. Instead, whether misconduct is within Rule 2010’s scope is ultimately a question of
whether the conduct raises concerns that the associated person will not “comply with the
regulatory requirements of the securities business” and will not “fulfill [his or her] fiduciary
duties in handling other people’s money.”20 Even if the misconduct does not involve a security,
the misconduct can indicate the associated person’s unfitness and FINRA can properly conclude
that “on another occasion” the misconduct could very well involve securities.21
For example, in Ialeggio, the respondent was an associated person of a member firm and
was employed by the member firm’s parent company.22 The Commission found that Ialeggio
had violated Rule 2010’s predecessor by obtaining reimbursement from the member firm’s
parent company—not the member firm—for expenses he did not incur and by improperly
inducing the parent company to pay for his country club initiation fees.23 The Commission held
that the Rule could apply to “misconduct not related directly to the securities industry” and even
to misconduct where “no customer was involved and no customer’s funds were jeopardized or
misappropriated.”24
Similarly, in Vail, the Fifth Circuit sanctioned Vail for misappropriating funds from a
political club and misrepresenting that the funds were in an account at Cigna, a member firm
where Vail was a securities salesman.25 The court noted the Commission’s consistent holding
that Rule 2010’s predecessor applied “even if [the] activity does not involve a security” and
determined that “Vail’s position as a fiduciary of the club managing the club’s funds constituted
business-related conduct” and thus was sanctionable.26

Id. The Fifth Circuit also held that Vail’s misrepresentations regarding the Cigna
account’s existence were within the scope of Rule 2010’s predecessor. But the Fifth Circuit held
that Vail’s breach of his fiduciary duty to the club was a separate basis for finding Vail’s conduct
actionable. See id. We reject Grivas’s contrary interpretation of Vail. Our view of Vail is
further supported by the Commission’s opinion in that action, in which the Commission
(continued . . .)

9
We thus conclude that Grivas’s conversion reflects a failure to observe high standards of
commercial honor and just and equitable principals of trade and thus violates Rule 2010.
D.

FINRA Rule 2010 is, and was applied in a manner, consistent with the
purposes of the Exchange Act.

We find that FINRA Rule 2010 is, and was applied in a manner, consistent with the
purposes of the Exchange Act. Rule 2010 reflects the mandate of Exchange Act Section
15A(b)(6), which requires, among other things, that FINRA design its rules to “promote just and
equitable principles of trade.”27 This standard “provides more flexibility than prescriptive
regulations and legal requirements” and, thus, prohibits dishonest practices even if those
practices may not be illegal or violate a specific rule.28 As a result, Rule 2010 is consistent with
the purposes of the Exchange Act.
We also find that FINRA applied Rule 2010 in a manner consistent with the purposes of
the Exchange Act. FINRA’s finding that Grivas’s conversion violated Rule 2010 was supported
by the record and underscores the purpose of Rule 2010 as a tool to prohibit dishonest practices.
E.

Grivas received sufficient notice of the claims against him.

Grivas also asserts that this proceeding should be dismissed because, while FINRA’s
complaint alleged that Grivas converted monies of “the Fund’s investors,” FINRA found only
that Grivas converted assets of the Fund. We agree with FINRA that this is a “distinction
without a difference.”
The standard for determining whether pleadings in FINRA proceedings are sufficient is
whether “the respondent understood the issue and was afforded full opportunity to justify its
conduct during the course of the litigation.”29 Notice is sufficient when the respondent “is
reasonably apprised of the issues in controversy and is not misled.”30

FINRA’s Complaint states that “Grivas converted approximately $280,000 of investor
funds raised through a fund that he formed . . . .”31 While the converted funds actually belonged
to the Fund, Grivas cannot argue that this distinction prevented him from being reasonably
apprised of the issues in controversy or misled him about the Department’s theory of liability.
Indeed, on multiple occasions, the Complaint indicates that the $280,000 was converted “from
the Fund.”32 Grivas stipulated that he transferred $280,000 from the Fund and FINRA based its
decision on this transfer. Grivas was never prevented from introducing evidence or argument at
the hearing on the basis of any purported distinctions. Indeed Grivas argued, unsuccessfully, that
the Department’s claim was deficient because the converted funds were from an investment
fund, not investors.33
We conclude that Grivas had sufficient notice of the issues being litigated and had ample
opportunity to and did present arguments—none of which had merit—in response to the
Department’s allegations that formed the basis of the sanction imposed.
III.

Sanctions
A.

The bar FINRA imposed on Grivas is neither excessive nor oppressive and
is necessary for the protection of investors.

Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 19(e)(2), we will sustain a FINRA sanction unless we
find it is “excessive or oppressive” or imposes an unnecessary or inappropriate burden on
competition.34 As part of this review, we consider any aggravating or mitigating factors35 and
whether the sanctions imposed by FINRA are remedial in nature and not punitive.36 We find the

Grivas cites without analysis to Department of Enforcement v. Zenke, 2009 FINRA
Discip. Lexis 37 (NAC Dec. 14, 2009). In that case, the NAC reversed a hearing panel’s finding
of liability and dismissed the Department’s claims because the Department had changed its
theory of liability during the hearing. The circumstances in Zenke are far different than those
here where Grivas was on notice of the bases of the Department’s charge against him which did
not change at the hearing.

15 U.S.C. § 78s(e)(2). Grivas does not claim, and the record does not show, that
FINRA’s action imposed an unnecessary or inappropriate burden on competition.

bar imposed on Grivas to be consistent with the statutory requirements and we sustain the
imposition of this penalty.
FINRA’s Sanction Guidelines state that “a bar is [a] standard” sanction for conversion
“regardless of [the] amount converted.”37 This approach reflects the judgment that, absent
mitigating factors, conversion “poses so substantial a risk to investors and/or the markets as to
render the violator unfit for employment in the securities industry.”38 Indeed, conversion is
antithetical to the basic requirement that customers and firms must be able to trust securities
professionals with their money,39 and one who intentionally misappropriates funds entrusted to
him demonstrates a lack of fitness to be in the securities industry. As a result, the Commission
has consistently sustained FINRA’s decision to impose a bar for conversion.40
Grivas does not contest that, assuming FINRA has authority to sanction him, a bar would
be an appropriate remedy. Indeed, Grivas agrees this is a matter “not in dispute.”41 Grivas also
does not argue that there are any mitigating factors that would warrant a lesser sanction.
We agree with FINRA that Grivas’s intentional, unauthorized transfer of $280,000 from
an investment fund to his associated broker-dealer to cure its net capital deficiency constitutes
the type of dishonesty and disrespect of one’s duties as a securities professional that warrants a
bar. We thus find that the imposition of a bar here is remedial, not punitive.
A bar is further supported by the fact that Grivas attempted to conceal his misconduct and
allowed inaccurate records to be maintained and inaccurate statements to be made to Fund
members.42 Grivas’s conversion harmed the Fund by removing $280,000 and putting those

funds at risk and provided a benefit to Grivas by allowing Obsidian Financial to continue
operating.43 Grivas also has a preexisting disciplinary history, which raises concerns about his
fitness and further supports the imposition of a bar in the public interest.44 Finally, while we
recognize that Grivas eventually repaid the converted funds, we find that this has little if any
mitigating effect because he did so only after FINRA had begun its investigation.45
Based on these factors, we conclude that barring Grivas from the securities industry is
neither excessive nor oppressive and is necessary and in the public interest.
An appropriate order will issue.46

(“[B]ecause Olson concealed her misconduct from the Firm for over a month, we find her
deception to be a significant factor supporting a bar.”).

See id. at 6-7 (listing as Principal Consideration 11, “whether the respondent’s
misconduct resulted directly or indirectly in injury to . . . other parties, and . . . the nature and
extent of the injury” and as Principal Consideration 17, “Whether the respondent’s misconduct
resulted in the potential for the respondent’s monetary or other gain”).

See id. at 6 (listing as Principal Consideration 1, “The respondent’s relevant disciplinary
history”). The Iowa Securities Bureau previously brought an action against Grivas for unethical
practices related to misrepresentations and omissions to a customer. On May 16, 1997, without
admitting or denying the charges, Grivas consented to cease and desist from future violations of
Iowa Code Chapter 502 (the Iowa Uniform Securities Act and its rules), paid a $2,000 fine, and
withdrew for one year as a securities agent in the State of Iowa.
45

See id. (Principal Consideration No. 4, listing as a mitigating factor “Whether the
respondent voluntarily and reasonably attempted, prior to detection and intervention, to pay
restitution or otherwise remedy the misconduct”); see, e.g., Gurfel, 1999 WL 172666, at *4
(sustaining bar for conversion where respondent had repaid funds). The NAC also found that
Grivas’s failure to acknowledge his misconduct was an aggravating factor. On appeal, Grivas
has taken greater responsibility for his actions, not questioning the NAC’s finding that he lacked
authority to transfer the funds. This belated change in position, however, does not outweigh the
other factors that support imposing a bar for Grivas’s actions.

We have considered all of the parties’ contentions. We have rejected or sustained them
to the extent that they are inconsistent or in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.
