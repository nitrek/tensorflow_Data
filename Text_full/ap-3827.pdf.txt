In the Matter of

ORDER SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

PAUL LEON WHITE, II

On April 15, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent. The Division of Enforcement filed a letter attaching
evidence that Respondent was served with the OIP by personal service on April 21, 2016.
Respondent’s answer is therefore due by May 11, 2016. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b).
The Division requests that a telephonic prehearing conference be scheduled after May 11,
2016, to determine the parties’ positions and set a briefing schedule for motions for summary
disposition. It is ORDERED that a telephonic prehearing conference be held on May 13, 2016,
at 10:00 a.m. EDT. The parties should be prepared to discuss a procedural schedule to resolve
this proceeding.
