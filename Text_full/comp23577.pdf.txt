12 Civ. 8676 (JSR)
Plaintiff,
MEMORANDUM ORDER
AND FINAL JUDGMENT

-vTHOMAS C. CONRADT and TRENT MARTIN,
Defendants.
-------------------------------------x
JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.

On November 29, 2012, plaintiff Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC")

filed suit against defendants Thomas C. Conradt

and David J. Weishaus,

later amending the complaint to add defendant

Trent Martin. See Complaint, Dkt.

l; Amended Complaint,

Dkt. 7. The

SEC alleged that the defendants had engaged in unlawful insider
trading ahead of IBM's 2009 acquisition of SPSS Inc.
Second Amended Complaint,

Dkt. 20,

~

("SPSS"). See

1. In this Memorandum Order,

the Court enters final judgment against defendant Conradt, ordering
him to pay $980,229 as a civil penalty for his unlawful insider
trading activity. This amount represents the profits made by Conradt
and his three downstream tippees in their trading of SPSS
securities. In an accompanying Order, the Court enters final
judgment against defendant Martin, ordering him to pay as a civil
penalty $7,625, which is the amount he made trading in SPSS
securities.

By way of background, the SEC alleged, and Conradt and Martin
do not dispute,

that in 2009, Conradt, who was then working as a

broker at EuroPaciric capital,

learned of IBM's upcoming acquisition

of SPSS from his roommate Trent Martin, who in turn had learned this
information from Martin's friend Michael Dallas,

an attorney who was

working on the deal. See Second Amended Complaint,

The three defendants in the instant case - Conradt, Martin, and

SEC. Two of these defendants, Conradt and Martin, agreed to

' For the purposes of this motion, the allegations of the Complaint are deemed to

Judgment as to Defendant Thomas C. Conradt, Dkt. 53, at 3-4; Judgment as to
Defendant Trent Martin, Dkt. 54, at 3-4.
The SEC also alleged, and Conradt acknowledged, that Conradt also told an
additional colleague, Matthew Lehrer, about the SPSS transaction. See Second
Amended Complaint, ~ 2; Transcript of Payton and Durant Trial ("Tr."), 179:9-10.

cooperate with the SEC, and the Court, on consent, entered judgment
against them on December 23, 2013. See Judgment as to Defendant
Thomas C. Conradt

("Conradt Judgment"),

Dkt. 53; Judgment as to

Defendant Trent Martin ("Martin Judgment),

Dkt. 54. As a consequence

of their cooperation agreements, the Court bifurcated the judgments
against Conradt and Martin, postponing the determination of civil
penalties until a post-cooperation time. Specifically, in the
judgments entered on December 23, 2013, the Court enjoined
defendants Conradt and Martin from engaging in future violations of
Section lO(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10-5
promulgated thereunder; ordered them to pay disgorgement in the
amount of $2,533.60 for Conradt and $7,625 for Martin; directed them
to pay prejudgment interest on the disgorged sums; but did not at
that time assess civil penalties. See Conradt Judgment; Martin
Judgment.

Instead, as part of the consensual agreement, the SEC

agreed not to thereafter request more as a civil penalty than each
defendant had paid in disgorgement unless the SEC "obtain[ed]
information indicating that

[the]

Defendant failed to cooperate

fully and truthfully." Conradt Judgment at 3-4; Martin Judgment at
3-4.
Weishaus's judgment was not bifurcated in the same way, and so
on January 27, 2014,

the Court entered final judgment as to

Weishaus. See Final Judgment As To Defendant David J. Weishaus
("Weishaus Judgment"),

Dkt. 56. In that Final Judgment, the Court,

in accordance with the terms of Weishaus's settlement with the SEC,
3

Case 1:12-cv-08676-JSR Document 106 Filed 06/16/16 Page 4 of 13

entered an injunction against defendant Weishaus; ordered him to pay
disgorgement in the amount of $127,485 and prejudgment interest
lhereon;

ctnd

of $127,485,

a.:s:se:s:sed against Weishaus a civil penalty in the amount
~'

one times the amount of his disgorgement. See

Weishaus Judgment at 2.
Thereafter, on May 29, 2015, defendants Weishaus and Conradt
moved to dismiss their judgments pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.

60(b)

See Defendant David J. Weishaus's Memorandum of Law in Support of
His Motion for Relief from Final Judgment

("Weishaus Vacatur Br."),

Dkt. 77; Memorandum of Law of Defendant Thomas C. Conradt in Support
of Motion to Vacate Judgment

("Conradt Vacatur Br."),

Dkt. 73.

Weishaus and Conradt argued, inter alia, that the Second Circuit's
subsequent decision in United States v. Newman,

773 F.3d 438

(2d

Cir. 2014), had rendered invalid the legal basis on which their
judgments were predicated. See Weishaus Vacatur Br. at 10-16;
Conradt Vacatur Br. at 7-15. On July 23, 2015, the Court denied
these motions for vacatur. See Amended Memorandum Order, Dkt. 82.
Defendants Weishaus and Conradt appealed these denials, and
Conradt's appeal is currently pending.

Meanwhile, on February 12, 2015, the Court granted the SEC's
unopposed motion to defer the determination of a civil penalty for
defendants Conradt and Martin until after the trial of the SEC's

On March 21, 2016, Weishaus and the SEC filed a stipulation withdrawing the
appeal and providing that Weishaus could reinstate it by May 20, 2016. On May 20,
2016, Weishaus and the SEC filed a stipulation extending to July 5, 2016 the time
within which Weishaus could reinstate his appeal. See App. Dkts. 102, 109.

suit against defendants Payton and Durant, or the resolution of that
related case. See Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Corrunission's
UnoppoBed Motion to Defer Civil Penalty Determination for Defendants
Trent Martin and Thomas Conradt, Dkt.

63. The purpose of deferring

the civil penalty determination as to Conradt and Martin was to give
the SEC and the Court the opportunity to determine whether these
defendants met their obligations under their cooperation agreements.
Ultimately, defendants Conradt and Martin testified at the trial of
defendants Payton and Durant, Conradt in person and Martin through a
videotape of his deposition. At trial, defendants Payton and Durant
were found liable for insider trading, and the Court entered final
judgment against them on May 16, 2016. See Jury Verdict, 14-cv-4644,
Dkt. 136; Memorandum Order and Final Judgment,
On March 18, 2016,

14-cv-4644, Dkt. 167.

following the trial of Payton and Durant,

the SEC moved for final judgment, including civil penalties, as to
defendants Conradt and Martin. See Plaintiff Securities and Exchange

judgment instead of within 14 days. See Consent to Application to

Opposition to Motion for Final Judgment

("Conradt Opp. Br."), Dkt.

100. The SEC replied to Conradt's opposition on April 22, 2016. See
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission's Reply Memorandum in
Support of Its Motion for Final Judgment Imposing a Civil Penalty
Against Thomas C. Conradt

("SEC Reply Br."),

Dkt. 103. Having

considered all of these submissions, the Court hereby enters final
judgment as follows.
As to defendant Martin, the SEC requests that the Court impose
a civil penalty of $7,625. See SEC Martin Br. at 1. The SEC had
agreed to request no more than this amount unless it found that
Martin failed to cooperate, see Martin Judgment at 3, and the SEC
stated in its brief on the instant motion for final judgment that,
in the SEC's view, Martin had complied with his cooperation
obligations. See SEC Martin Br. at 3. The Court agrees with this
assessment. Accordingly, the Court dockets, alongside this
Memorandum Order, the SEC's proposed final judgment as to Martin,
with the revision (unopposed by the SEC) that payment is to be due
within 30 days of the entry of that judgment, as distinct from the
14 days specified in the SEC's proposed judgment.
The case of defendant Conradt, however, presents complications.
The SEC argues that Conradt materially breached his cooperation
agreement and therefore asks the Court to impose a civil penalty
6

Case 1:12-cv-08676-JSR Document 106 Filed 06/16/16 Page 7 of 13

considerably higher than the $2,533.60 that the SEC had committed to
requesting (at most)
Dr.

a~

i;

ca11raUL

if Conradt fully cooperated. See SEC Conradt

Juagmen~

aL

3.

3pec1r1ca11y, the SEC requests that

the Court impose on Conradt a civil penalty of $2,940,687, which
represents three times the amount of profits made by Conradt and his
downstream tippees
on SPSS

(Weishaus,

Payton, and Durant)

in their trading

($980,229). See SEC Conradt Br. at 1. Conradt opposes the

SEC's proposed civil penalty, arguing that he did not materially
breach his cooperation agreement and that,

in any event, a civil

penalty as high as $2,940,687 would be unwarranted. See Conradt Opp.
Br. at 2.
The Court, like the SEC, determines that Conradt "failed to
cooperate fully and truthfully," thereby materially breaching his
cooperation agreement. See Conradt Judgment at 3; Consent of
Defendant Thomas C. Conradt, Dkt. 53, at 2. The SEC was therefore
entitled to request more than $2,533.60 as a civil penalty against
Conradt, and the Court - which has an independent obligation to
assess an appropriate civil penalty - declines to grant Conradt the
substantial benefits of truthful cooperation.
In particular, the Court finds that Conradt's testimony at the
trial of Payton and Durant

("the trial")

in February 2016 materially

varied from Conradt's testimony at his deposition on July 17, 2015
in ways that indicate that Conradt was intentionally watering down
his prior testimony in contravention of his cooperation agreement
and, the Court finds,

in contravention of the truth.
7

For example,

Case 1:12-cv-08676-JSR Document 106 Filed 06/16/16 Page 8 of 13

Conradt testified at his deposition that in between his second and
third conversations about SPSS with his roommate Martin, Durant came
up

to Conradt and asked him ir he had heard anything else from his

roommate about SPSS. See Tr. 256:19-257:8.

5

episode at trial, Conradt stated "You know,

But when asked about this
I don't recall offhand."

Tr. 256:15-18. Conradt also testified at his deposition that after
his third conversation about SPSS with Martin, Conradt updated
Payton,

Durant, and Lehrer about the information that Martin had

told him. See Tr. 364:21-365:5. Yet at trial Conradt, when
questioned about providing this update, responded "I can't say that
with any certainty sitting here today." Tr.

364:10-17. Further,

Conradt testified at his deposition that he learned from his
colleague Matthew Lehrer that Lehrer had told Durant that Conradt's
roommate had said SPSS was ripe for a buyout. See Transcript of
Payton and Durant Trial

("Tr."), 241:5-15. At trial, however,

Conradt claimed that he did not remember this statement of Lehrer's,
because "a lot of these were really casual conversations, and over
the course of seven years and multiple court documents that I've
read

it's been very, very confusing for me to peg down exactly

what was said in each conversation to each person.

" Tr.

237:19-238:12.
In the Court's view, the material discrepancies between
Conradt's deposition testimony and his testimony at the Payton and

s This reference is to the transcript of the trial of Payton and Durant,

the SEC played excerpts of Conradt's deposition at this trial.

8

because

Case 1:12-cv-08676-JSR Document 106 Filed 06/16/16 Page 9 of 13

Durant trial indicate that Conradt did not cooperate fully and
truthfully and that, more broadly, Conradt did not respect the
processes of justice.

6

Either Conradt lied at his deposition when he

testified to certain facts,

or

(as the Court deems more likely)

he

lied at the trial when he said he did not remember these facts - and
in both proceedings, Conradt took an oath to tell the truth.
After having carefully assessed Conradt's demeanor at trial,
the Court does not credit Conradt's explanation that his memory
failed him at trial as to points he clearly and specifically
recalled seven months earlier, during his deposition.

In fact,

the

Court was sufficiently troubled by Conradt's testimony at the time
of the trial that the Court put questions to Conradt outside the
presence of the jury. See Tr. 144:2-148:22, 215:5-12. Moreover,
Conradt's memory at trial of events that had taken place in 2009 was
hardly uniformly deficient.

For example, Conradt testified at trial

with particularity, and his recollection was readily refreshed,
regarding events surrounding a rent reduction for his apartment in
May 2009. See Tr. 294:2-296:11.
The material discrepancies in Conradt's testimony similarly
cannot be explained, as Conradt suggests, by the fact that the SEC
did not meet with Conradt to prepare him for trial.

See Conradt Opp.

The SEC argues that Conradt's motive for "feign[ing] a lack of recollectionu at
trial was Conradt's view that a loss for the SEC in its suit against Payton and
Durant would bolster Conradt's appeal of this Court's denial of Conradt's motion
to vacate his judgment. See SEC Conradt Br. at 6, 9. The Court need not make any
definitive determination as to Conradt's motivations in order to conclude that
Conradt failed to cooperate in a truthful and forthright manner.

Br. at 4. The SEC notes that it also did not meet with Conradt in
advance of his deposition, see SEC Reply Br. at 3. Further, the fact
lhat the SEC did not meet with Conradt in advance of trial - which
it had no obligation whatsoever to do - does not explain why
Conradt's memory was not, at crucial points,

refreshed by his

deposition or other transcripts while he was testifying at trial.
See, e.g., Tr. 237:23-238:12,

359:3-24.

Conradt also argues that his co-defendant Martin's deposition
testimony differed in certain ways from previous statements that
Martin had made, and yet Martin was not found to have breached his
cooperation agreement. See Conradt Opp. Br. at 16-17; see also,
~'

Conradt Opp. Br., Exhibit 6,

Dkt. 102-6 (Martin deposition),

148:13-151:10. However, the Court does not view these alleged
discrepancies on Martin's part to be either as extensive or as
material as the inconsistencies between Conradt's deposition
testimony and his trial testimony.
In short, Conradt is not entitled to intentionally change his
testimony in a highly material way and without justification, and
then to reap the benefits of an agreement to cooperate fully and
truthfully. Accordingly, the Court finds that Conradt's penalty
should not be limited to one that would be properly imposed on a
truthful cooperator.
As to the appropriate amount of the civil penalty to be
assessed against defendant Conradt, the insider trading laws provide
that "[t]he amount of the penalty which may be imposed on the person
10

Case 1:12-cv-08676-JSR Document 106 Filed 06/16/16 Page 11 of 13

who committed such violation [of the insider trading laws]

shall be

determined by the court in light of the facts and circumstances, but
~t1all

not exceed three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a

result of such unlawful purchase,
§

78u-l (a) (2)

sale, or communication." 15 U.S.C.

More specifically,

[c] ivil penalties are designed to punish the individual
violator and deter future violations of the securities laws.
In determining whether civil penal ties should be
imposed, and the amount of the fine, courts look to a number
of
factors,
including
( 1)
the
egregiousness
of
the
defendant's conduct;
(2) the degree of the defendant's
scienter;
(3)
whether the defendant's conduct created
substantial losses or the risk of substantial losses to
other persons;
(4) whether the defendant's conduct was
isolated or recurrent; and ( 5) whether the penalty should
be reduced due to the defendant's demonstrated current and
future financial condition.
SEC v. Haligiannis,

470 F. Supp. 2d 373, 386 (S.D.N.Y. 2007).

Here, the Court finds that these factors support a civil
penalty of one times the amount of the trading profits of Conradt
and his downstream tippees Weishaus,

Payton, and Durant.

7

In

particular, Conradt was trained as a lawyer and was a licensed
stockbroker. See Tr.

88:10-90:14. On July 1, 2009,

7

in an instant

The Second Circuit has explained that "[a] tippee's gains are attributable to the
tipper, regardless whether benefit accrues to the tipper. The value of the rule in
preventing misuse of insider information would be virtually nullified if those in
possession of such information, although prohibited from trading for their own
accounts, were free to use the inside information on trades to benefit their
families, friends, and business associates." SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 49 (2d
Cir. 1998). This statement was made in the disgorgement context, but it equally
applies in the setting of civil penalties, since the gains of downstream tippees
count, in the terms of the insider trading sanctions statute, as "the profit
gained or loss avoided as a result of such unlawful purchase, sale, or
communication." 15 U.S.C. § 78u-l(a) (2). See SEC v. Gupta, 569 F. App'x 45 (2d
Cir. 2014) (summary order) ("Precedent in this Circuit is clear that a tippee' s
gains and losses avoided are attributable to the tipper, regardless whether
benefit accrues to the tipper.") (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. SEC v.
Svoboda, 409 F. Supp. 2d 331, 347-48 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).

11

Case 1:12-cv-08676-JSR Document 106 Filed 06/16/16 Page 12 of 13

message conversation between Conradt and Weishaus about trading in
SPSS, Conradt told Weishaus that "we gotta keep this in the family,"
and Wel5hau5 noled that Martha Stewart had gone to jail. See SEC
Conradt Br., Exhibit 6,
purchases,

Dkt.

93-6. Conradt also made multiple stock

see Conradt Opp. Br. at 19, and,

as Conradt acknowledged,

he provided updates to his tippees about the SPSS acquisition. See
Conradt Dep.,

165:15-170:17; Tr. 270:13-22; 455:6-456:13. Even

though the amount that Conradt traded was less than the amount
traded by his co-defendants or by Payton and Durant, Conradt was
responsible for transferring the tip from his roommate Martin to
EuroPacific, and for tipping three co-workers who also purchased
SPSS securities. Indeed, on July 23,

2009, Conradt told Weishaus

that Conradt was "setting this deal up for everyone" and "makin
everyone rich." See SEC Conradt Br., Exhibit 7,

Dkt.

93-7. All these

features of Conradt's conduct speak to the egregiousness of his
behavior and his high level of scienter, which support a substantial
civil penalty.
However,

countervailing factors - notably Conradt's precarious

financial circumstances, see Conradt Opp. Br. at 21 - counsel
against imposing the SEC's requested civil penalty of treble
damages, or $2,940,687. Moreover, the Court finds that a penalty of
one times the amount gained by Conradt and his downstream tippees is
adequate to ensure effective deterrence of such serious breaches of
the securities laws.

12

Case 1:12-cv-08676-JSR Document 106 Filed 06/16/16 Page 13 of 13

Consequently, by way of final judgment supplementing the
Consent Judgment previously ordered, the Court hereby imposes on
Conradt a

civil penalty of $980,229, to be paid to the SEC. Payment

is to be made at the rate of 20% of Conradt's gross monthly income
beginning with July 2016, with each payment to be made no later than
two weeks after the end of the month. Thus, the first payment,
covering the month of July 2016, must be made no later than August
14, 2016.

In this connection, Conradt will supply the SEC,

immediately upon request, with any and all financial information
requested by the SEC.
The Clerk of Court is directed to close docket entries 88 and
92, and to close the case.

Clerk of Court
Dear Litigant:
Enclosed is a copy of the judgment entered in your case. If you disagree with a judgment or
final order of the district court, you may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit. To start this process, file a “Notice of Appeal” with this Court’s Pro Se
Intake Unit.
You must file your notice of appeal in this Court within 30 days after the judgment or order
that you wish to appeal is entered on the Court’s docket, or, if the United States or its officer
or agency is a party, within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order. If you are unable
to file your notice of appeal within the required time, you may make a motion for extension
of time, but you must do so within 60 days from the date of entry of the judgment, or
within 90 days if the United States or its officer or agency is a party, and you must show
excusable neglect or good cause for your inability to file the notice of appeal by the
deadline.
Please note that the notice of appeal is a one-page document containing your name, a
description of the final order or judgment (or part thereof) being appealed, and the name of
the court to which the appeal is taken (the Second Circuit) – it does not include your reasons
or grounds for the appeal. Once your appeal is processed by the district court, your notice
of appeal will be sent to the Court of Appeals and a Court of Appeals docket number will
be assigned to your case. At that point, all further questions regarding your appeal must be
directed to that court.
The filing fee for a notice of appeal is $505 payable in cash, by bank check, certified check,
or money order, to “Clerk of Court, S.D.N.Y.” No personal checks are accepted. If you are
unable to pay the $505 filing fee, complete the “Motion to Proceed in Forma Pauperis on
Appeal” form and submit it with your notice of appeal to the Pro Se Intake Unit. If the
district court denies your motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, or has certified
under 28 U.S.C. ' 1915(a)(3) that an appeal would not be taken in good faith, you may file a
motion in the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, but you must do so
within 30 days after service of the district court order that stated that you could not proceed
in forma pauperis on appeal.
For additional issues regarding the time for filing a notice of appeal, see Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 4(a). There are many other steps to beginning and proceeding with
your appeal, but they are governed by the rules of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. For more information, visit the Second Circuit

United States District Court
Southern District of New York

HOW TO APPEAL YOUR CASE TO THE UNITED STATES COURT
OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
If you disagree with a judgment or final order of the district court, you may appeal to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. To start this process, file a
“Notice of Appeal” with this Court’s Pro Se Intake Unit.
You must file your notice of appeal in this Court within 30 days after the judgment or
order that you wish to appeal is entered on the Court’s docket, or, if the United States or
its officer or agency is a party, within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order. If
you are unable to file your notice of appeal within the required time, you may make a
motion for extension of time, but you must do so within 60 days from the date of entry
of the judgment, or within 90 days if the United States or its officer or agency is a party,
and you must show excusable neglect or good cause for your inability to file the notice
of appeal by the deadline.
Please note that the notice of appeal is a one-page document containing your name, a
description of the final order or judgment (or part thereof) being appealed, and the
name of the court to which the appeal is taken (the Second Circuit) – it does not include
your reasons or grounds for the appeal. Once your appeal is processed by the district
court, your notice of appeal will be sent to the Court of Appeals and a Court of Appeals
docket number will be assigned to your case. At that point, all further questions
regarding your appeal must be directed to that court.
The filing fee for a notice of appeal is $505 payable in cash, by bank check, certified
check, or money order, to “Clerk of Court, S.D.N.Y.” No personal checks are accepted. If
you are unable to pay the $505 filing fee, complete the “Motion to Proceed in Forma
Pauperis on Appeal” form and submit it with your notice of appeal to the Pro Se Intake
Unit. If the district court denies your motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, or
has certified under 28 U.S.C. ' 1915(a)(3) that an appeal would not be taken in good
faith, you may file a motion in the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal in forma pauperis,
but you must do so within 30 days after service of the district court order that stated
that you could not proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.
For additional issues regarding the time for filing a notice of appeal, see Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 4(a). There are many other steps to beginning and proceeding with
your appeal, but they are governed by the rules of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. For more information, visit the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals website at http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/.
