Insurance Company Settles Charges Due to Accounting Errors
July 15, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Connecticutbased insurance holding company has agreed to pay $600,000 to settle charges that it violated the
reporting, internal accounting controls, and books-and-records provisions of the federal securities
laws based on accounting errors identified as part of the company’s announced restatement.
An SEC investigation found that The Phoenix Companies, Inc. made dozens of errors in its
previously issued audited and unaudited financial statements contained in its 2011 and 2010 SEC
filings. These errors included basic errors in Phoenix’s calculations, assumptions, and
application of accounting guidance to complex insurance products, errors due to improper
accounting determinations, and carelessness in the implementation of Phoenix’s accounting
systems. Based on these identified errors, on April 1, 2014, Phoenix restated and amended its
consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. There were
several categories of identified errors in Phoenix’s restated and amended financial statements,
including accounting for certain universal life type products, loss recognition, fixed indexed
annuities, and derivative valuation. Phoenix also identified several material weaknesses in the
company’s internal control over financial reporting.
The SEC’s order finds that Phoenix violated the reporting, internal accounting controls, and
books-and-records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 13(a),
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
Without admitting or denying the findings, Phoenix agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist
order and pay a $600,000 penalty. Phoenix and its subsidiary, PHL Variable Insurance
Company, previously settled with the SEC for their delinquent filings. See The Phoenix
Companies, Inc. and PHL Variable Insurance Company, Exchange Act Release No. 72738
(Aug. 1, 2014); The Phoenix Companies, Inc. and PHL Variable Insurance Company, Exchange
Act Release No. 71768 (Mar. 21, 2014). On June 20, 2016, Phoenix merged with a subsidiary of
Nassau Reinsurance Group Holdings, L.P. and became a privately held company and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Nassau Re.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Matthew R. Estabrook, Michael C. Baker, David F.
Miller, and Laura B. Josephs. The case was supervised by Scott W. Friestad.
