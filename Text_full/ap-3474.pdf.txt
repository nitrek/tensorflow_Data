The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted proceedings in this matter on March

the Eastern District of New York. Aegis Capital, LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2794,

prehearing conference would take place on January 8, 2016, but would be canceled if the U.S.
Attorney filed a written notice that requested and provided reasons for the stay to remain in
effect. Aegis Capital, LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3103, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3654.
On January 6, 2016, the U.S. Attorney submitted a status report requesting and providing
reasons for the stay to remain in effect. Accordingly, I POSTPONE the scheduled prehearing
conference and ORDER the stay to remain in effect. A telephonic prehearing conference in this
matter will take place on Monday, May 16, 2016, at 10:30 a.m. EDT. If the U.S. Attorney files a
written notice before that date asking and providing reasons for the stay to remain in effect, the
telephonic prehearing conference will be canceled.
