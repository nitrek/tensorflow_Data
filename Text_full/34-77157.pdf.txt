BACKGROUND

5

Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act 1 provides an alternative insolvency regime for the orderly
liquidation of large financial companies that meet specified criteria. 2 Section 205 of Title II sets
forth certain provisions specific to the orderly liquidation of certain large broker-dealers, and
paragraph (h) of section 205 requires the Agencies, in consultation with the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), jointly to issue rules to implement section 205. 3
In the case of a broker-dealer, or in which the largest U.S. subsidiary of a financial
company4 is a broker-dealer, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (“Board”) and the
Commission are authorized jointly to issue a written orderly liquidation recommendation to the
U.S. Treasury Secretary (“Secretary”). The FDIC must be consulted in such a case.
The recommendation, which may be sua sponte or at the request of the Secretary, must
contain a discussion regarding eight criteria enumerated in section 203(a)(2) 5 and be approved
by a vote of not fewer than a two-thirds majority of each agency’s governing body then serving. 6
Based on similar but not identical criteria enumerated in section 203(b), the Secretary would
consider the recommendation and (in consultation with the President) determine whether the
financial company poses a systemic risk meriting liquidation under Title II. 7

Title II also provides that in any case in which the Corporation is appointed receiver for a
covered financial company, 8 the Corporation may appoint itself as receiver for any covered
subsidiary9 if the Corporation and the Secretary make the requisite joint determination specified
in section 210. 10
A company that is the subject of an affirmative section 203(b) or section 210(a)(1)(E)
determination would be considered a covered financial company for purposes of Title II. 11 As
discussed below, a covered broker or dealer is a covered financial company that is registered
with the Commission as a broker or dealer and is a member of SIPC. 12 Irrespective of how the
broker-dealer was placed into a Title II resolution, section 205 regarding the liquidation of
covered broker-dealers and the proposed rule (if adopted) would always apply to the brokerdealer even if section 210 is invoked. 13
Upon a determination under section 203 or section 210, a covered financial company
would be placed into an orderly liquidation proceeding and the FDIC would be appointed
receiver. 14 In the case of a covered broker-dealer, the FDIC would appoint SIPC as trustee for

the covered broker-dealer. 15 Although the statute refers to the appointment of SIPC as trustee for
the “liquidation of the covered broker-dealer under [the Securities Investor Protection Act
(“SIPA”)]”, 16 the proposed rule simply refers to SIPC as trustee for the covered broker-dealer
since the Title II receivership is not a liquidation of the covered broker-dealer under SIPA, but
rather an orderly liquidation of the broker-dealer under Title II that incorporates the customer
protection provisions of SIPA. The FDIC could utilize a bridge financial company, a bridge
broker-dealer, 17 as a means to liquidate the covered broker-dealer, transferring customer
accounts and associated customer name securities and customer property to such bridge financial
company. 18 In the event that a bridge broker-dealer were created, SIPC, as trustee under SIPA
for the covered broker-dealer, would determine claims and distribute assets retained in the
receivership of the covered broker-dealer in a manner consistent with SIPA. 19 The transfer of
customer property, and advances from SIPC, made to the bridge broker-dealer and allocated to a
customer’s account at the bridge broker-dealer would satisfy a customer’s net equity claims
against the covered broker-dealer to the extent of the value, as of the appointment date, of such
allocated property. SIPC would have no powers or duties with respect to assets and liabilities of

customer protections of SIPA will be integrated with the other provisions of Title II; the roles of
the Corporation as receiver and SIPC as trustee for a covered broker-dealer; and the
administration of claims in an orderly liquidation of a covered broker-dealer.
II.

PROPOSED RULE
A.

Definitions 22

The proposed definitions section would define certain key terms. Consistent with the
remainder of the proposed rule, the definitions are designed to help ensure that, as the statute
requires, net equity claims of customers against a covered broker-dealer are determined and
satisfied in a manner and amount that is at least as beneficial to customers as would have been
the case had the covered broker-dealer been liquidated under SIPA without the appointment of
the FDIC as receiver and without any transfer of assets or liabilities to a bridge financial
company, and with a filing date as of the date on which the FDIC was appointed as receiver. 23
To effectuate the statutory requirement, the definitions in the proposed rule are very similar or
identical to the corresponding definitions in SIPA and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, and where
they differ, it is for purposes of clarity only and not to change or modify the meaning of the
definitions under either Act.

20

12 U.S.C. 5385(b)(1).

21

12 U.S.C. 5385(f).

22

If adopted, the definitions section would appear in 12 CFR 380.60 for purposes of the Corporation and 17
CFR 302.100 for purposes of the Commission.

23

See 12 U.S.C. 5385(f)(1) (pertaining to obligations to customers) and 12 U.S.C. 5385(d)(1)(A) through (C)
(limiting certain actions of the Corporation that would adversely affect, diminish or otherwise impair
certain customer rights).

1.

Definitions Relating to Covered Broker-Dealers

The term covered broker or dealer would be defined as “a covered financial company
that is a qualified broker or dealer.” 24 Pursuant to section 201(a)(10) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the
terms customer, customer name securities, customer property, and net equity in the context of a
covered broker-dealer will have the same meaning as the corresponding terms in section 16 of
SIPA. 25
Section 16(2)(A) of SIPA defines customer of a debtor, in pertinent part, as any person
(including any person with whom the debtor deals as principal or agent) who has a claim on
account of securities received, acquired, or held by the debtor in the ordinary course of its
business as a broker or dealer from or for the securities accounts of such person for safekeeping,
with a view to sale, to cover consummated sales, pursuant to purchases, as collateral, security, or
for purposes of effecting transfer. 26 Section 16(3) of SIPA defines customer name securities as
securities which were held for the account of a customer on the filing date by or on behalf of the
debtor and which on the filing date were registered in the name of the customer, or were in the
process of being so registered pursuant to instructions from the debtor, but does not include
securities registered in the name of the customer which, by endorsement or otherwise, were in

24

See §§ 380.60(d) and 302.100(d), as proposed. See also 12 U.S.C. 5381(a)(7).

25

12 U.S.C. 5381(a)(10) (“The terms ‘customer’, ‘customer name securities’, ‘customer property’, and ‘net
equity’ in the context of a covered broker or dealer, have the same meanings as in section 16 of the
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78lll).”). See also 15 U.S.C. 78lll and §§ 380.60 and
302.100, as proposed.

26

15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(A). See also §§ 380.60(e) and 302.100(e), as proposed (“The term customer of a
covered broker or dealer shall have the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2) provided that the references
therein to debtor shall mean the covered broker or dealer.”).
10

negotiable form. 27 Section 16(4) of SIPA defines customer property, in pertinent part, as cash
and securities (except customer name securities delivered to the customer) at any time received,
acquired, or held by or for the account of a debtor from or for the securities accounts of a
customer, and the proceeds of any such property transferred by the debtor, including property
unlawfully converted. 28 Section (16)(11) of SIPA defines net equity as the dollar amount of the
account or accounts of a customer, to be determined by – (A) calculating the sum which would
have been owed by the debtor to such customer if the debtor had liquidated, by sale or purchase
on the filing date – (i) all securities positions of such customer (other than customer name
securities reclaimed by such customer); and (ii) all positions in futures contracts and options on
futures contracts held in a portfolio margining account carried as a securities account pursuant to
a portfolio margining program approved by the Commission, including all property
collateralizing such positions, to the extent that such property is not otherwise included herein;

27

15 U.S.C. 78lll(3). See also §§ 380.60(f) and 302.100(f), as proposed (“The term customer name securities
shall have the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 78lll(3) provided that the references therein to debtor shall
mean the covered broker or dealer and the references therein to filing date shall mean the appointment
date.”).

28

15 U.S.C. 78lll(4). The definition of customer property goes on to include: (1) “securities held as property
of the debtor to the extent that the inability of the debtor to meet his obligations to customers for their net
equity claims based on securities of the same class and series of an issuer is attributable to the debtor’s
noncompliance with the requirements of section 15(c)(3) of the 1934 Act and the rules prescribed under
such section”; (2) “resources provided through the use or realization of customers’ debit cash balances and
other customer-related debit items as defined by the Commission by rule”; (3) “any cash or securities
apportioned to customer property pursuant to section 3(d) [of SIPA]”; (4) “in the case of a portfolio
margining account of a customer that is carried as a securities account pursuant to a portfolio margining
program approved by the Commission, a futures contract or an option on a futures contract received,
acquired, or held by or for the account of a debtor form or for such portfolio margining account, and the
proceeds thereof”; and (5) “any other property of the debtor which, upon compliance with applicable laws,
rules, and regulations, would have been set aside or held for the benefit of customers, unless the trustee
determines that including such property within the meaning of such term would not significantly increase
customer property.” See also §§380.60(g) and 302.100(g), as proposed (“The term customer property shall
have the same meaning as in 15 U.S.C. 78lll(4) provided that the references therein to debtor shall mean the
covered broker or dealer.”).
11

minus (B) any indebtedness of such customer to the debtor on the filing date; plus (C) any
payment by such customer of such indebtedness to the debtor which is made with the approval of
the trustee and within such period as the trustee may determine (but in no event more than sixty
days after the publication of notice under section (8)(a) [of SIPA]). 29
The proposed definition of appointment date is the date of the appointment of the
Corporation as receiver for a covered financial company that is a covered broker or dealer. 30 The
appointment date would constitute the filing date as that term is used under SIPA 31 and, like the
filing date under SIPA, is the reference date for the computation of net equity. 32

shall mean the covered broker or dealer and the references therein to filing date shall mean the appointment
date.”).

liquidation proceeding, the term filing date means the date on which the Corporation is appointed as
receiver of the covered broker or dealer.”); 15 U.S.C. 78lll(7) (“The term filing date means the date on
which an application for a protective decree is filed under section 5(a)(3), except that – (A) if a petition
under title 11 of the United States Code concerning the debtor was filed before such date, the term filing
date means the date on which such petition was filed; (B) if the debtor is the subject of a proceeding
pending in any court or before any agency of the United States or any State in which a receiver, trustee, or
liquidator for such debtor has been appointed and such proceeding was commenced before the date on
which such application was filed, the term filing date means the date on which such proceeding was
commenced; or (C) if the debtor is the subject of a direct payment procedure or was the subject of a direct
payment procedure discontinued by SIPC pursuant to section 10(f), the term filing date means the date on
which notice of such direct payment procedure was published under section 10(b).”).
12

In addition to the definitions relating to covered broker-dealers under section 201(a)(10)
of the Dodd-Frank Act, 33 the Agencies also propose to define the following terms: (1) bridge
broker or dealer; 34 (2) Commission; 35 (3) qualified broker or dealer; 36 (4) SIPA 37 and (5) SIPC. 38
The term bridge broker or dealer would be defined as a new financial company organized
by the Corporation in accordance with section 210(h) of the Dodd-Frank Act for the purpose of
resolving a covered broker or dealer. 39 The term Commission would be defined as the Securities
and Exchange Commission. 40 The term qualified broker or dealer would refer to a broker or
dealer that (A) is registered with the Commission under section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)); and (B) is a member of SIPC, but is not itself subject to a Title
II receivership. 41 This definition is consistent with the statutory definition but is abbreviated for
clarity. It is not intended to change or modify the statutory definition. The term SIPA would

33

See 12 U.S.C. 5381(a)(10) (“The terms ‘customer’, ‘customer name securities’, ‘customer property’, and
‘net equity’ in the context of a covered broker or dealer, have the same meanings as in section 78lll of title
15.”).

would refer to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. 43
B.

Appointment of Receiver and Trustee for Covered Broker-Dealer 44

Upon the FDIC’s appointment as receiver for a covered broker-dealer, section 205 of the
Dodd-Frank Act specifies that the Corporation shall appoint SIPC to act as trustee for the
liquidation under SIPA of the covered broker-dealer. 45 The proposed rule deviates from the
statutory language in some cases to clarify the orderly liquidation process. For example, the
proposed rule would make it clear that SIPC is to be appointed as trustee for the covered brokerdealer but deletes the phrase “for the liquidation under SIPA” since in reality there is no
proceeding under SIPA and the covered broker-dealer is being liquidated under Title II. Section
205 of the Dodd-Frank Act also states that court approval is not required for such appointment. 46
For ease and clarity, the proposed rule would incorporate these statutory roles which are further
explained in other sections of the proposed rule. 47

Commission. The rule text in both CFRs will be identical.

48

If adopted, the notice and application for protective decree for the covered broker-dealer section will appear
in 12 CFR 380.62 for purposes of the FDIC and 17 CFR 302.102 for purposes of the Commission.
14

Upon the appointment of SIPC as trustee for the covered broker-dealer, Title II requires
SIPC, as trustee, promptly to file an application for a protective decree with a federal district
court, and SIPC and the Corporation, in consultation with the Commission, jointly to determine
the terms of the protective decree to be filed. 49 Although a SIPA proceeding is conducted under
bankruptcy court supervision, 50 a Title II proceeding is conducted entirely outside of the
bankruptcy courts, through an administrative process, with the FDIC acting as receiver. 51 As a
result, a primary purpose of filing a notice and application for a protective decree is to give
notice to interested parties that an orderly liquidation proceeding has been initiated. The
proposed rule on notice and application for protective decree provides additional clarification of
the statutory requirement by setting forth the venue in which the notice and application for a
protective decree is to be filed. It states that a notice and application for a protective decree is to
be filed with the federal district court in which a liquidation of the covered broker-dealer under
SIPA is pending, or if no such SIPA liquidation is pending, the federal district court for the
district within which the covered broker-dealer’s principal place of business is located. 52 This
court is a federal district court of competent jurisdiction specified in section 21 or 27 of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78u, 78aa. 53 It also is the court with jurisdiction over suits seeking de

novo judicial claims determinations under section 210(a)(4)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 54 While
the statute grants authority to file the notice and application for a protective decree in any federal
court of competent jurisdiction specified in section 21 or 27 or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the proposed rule restricts the filing to the courts specified above in order to make it easier
for interested parties to know where the protective decree might be filed. The proposed rule also
clarifies that if the notice and application for a protective decree is filed on a date other than the
appointment date, the filing shall be deemed to have occurred on the appointment date for
purposes of the rule. 55
This proposed section of the rule governing the notice and application for a protective
decree would also include a non-exclusive list of notices drawn from other parts of Title II. 56
The goal would be to inform interested parties that the covered broker-dealer is in orderly
liquidation, and to highlight the application of certain provisions of the orderly liquidation
authority particularly with respect to applicable stays and other matters that might be addressed
in a protective decree issued under SIPA. A notice and application for a protective decree under
Title II may, among other things, provide for notice: (1) that any existing case or proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code or SIPA would be dismissed, effective as of the appointment date,
and no such case or proceeding may be commenced with respect to a covered broker-dealer at

54

have vested in any entity other than the covered broker-dealer as a result of any case or
proceeding commenced with respect to the covered broker-dealer under the Bankruptcy Code,
SIPA, or any similar provision of state liquidation or insolvency law applicable to the covered
broker-dealer; 58 (3) of the request of the Corporation as receiver for a stay in any judicial action
or proceeding in which the covered broker-dealer is or becomes a party for a period of up to 90
days from the appointment date; 59 (4) that except with respect to qualified financial contracts
(“QFCs”), 60 no person may exercise any right or power to terminate, accelerate, or declare a
default under any contract to which the covered broker-dealer is a party or to obtain possession
of or exercise control over any property of the covered broker-dealer or affect any contractual
rights of the covered broker-dealer without the consent of the FDIC as receiver of the covered
broker-dealer upon consultation with SIPC during the 90-day period beginning from the

The proposed rule makes clear that the matters listed for inclusion in the notice and
application for a protective decree are neither mandatory nor all-inclusive. The items listed are
those that the Agencies believe might provide useful guidance to customers and other parties
who may be less familiar with the Title II process than with a SIPA proceeding. It is worth
noting that the language relating to QFCs is rather general. In certain circumstances it may be
worthwhile specifically to highlight the one-day stay provisions in section 210(c)(10) of the
Dodd-Frank Act, the provisions relating to the enforcement of affiliate contracts under section
210(c)(16) of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other specific provisions relating to QFCs or other

Power to Establish Bridge Broker-Dealer; Transfer of Customer
Accounts and other Assets and Liabilities

Section 210 of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the Corporation’s powers as receiver of a
covered financial company. 64 One such power the Corporation has, as receiver, is the power to
form bridge financial companies. 65 Paragraph (a) of this section of the proposed rule states that
the Corporation as receiver for a covered broker-dealer, or in anticipation of being appointed
receiver for a covered broker-dealer, may organize one or more bridge broker-dealers with
respect to a covered broker-dealer. 66 Paragraph (b) of this section of the proposed rule states that
if the Corporation were to establish one or more bridge broker-dealers with respect to a covered
broker-dealer, then the Corporation as receiver for such covered broker-dealer shall transfer all
customer accounts and all associated customer name securities and customer property to such
bridge broker[s]-dealer[s] unless the Corporation, after consultation with the Commission and
SIPC, determines that: (1) the transfer of such customer accounts, customer name securities, and
customer property to one or more qualified broker-dealers will occur promptly such that the use
of the bridge broker[s]-dealer[s] would not facilitate such transfer to one or more qualified
broker-dealers; or (2) the transfer of such customer accounts to the bridge broker[s]-dealer[s]
would materially interfere with the ability of the FDIC to avoid or mitigate serious adverse

effects on financial stability or economic conditions in the United States. 67 The two conditions
in paragraph (b) of the proposed rule are contained in Title II and are provided in the proposed
rule for ease and clarity and to make it clear the transfer to a bridge broker-dealer will take place
unless a transfer to a qualified broker-dealer is imminent. 68 The use of the word “promptly” in
the proposed rule, in this context, is intended to emphasize the urgency of transferring customer
accounts, customer name securities, and customer property either to a qualified broker-dealer or
to a bridge broker-dealer as soon as practicable to allow customers the earliest possible access to
their accounts.
Paragraph (c) of this section of the proposed rule states that the Corporation as receiver
for the covered broker-dealer also may transfer to such bridge broker[s]-dealer[s] any other
assets and liabilities of the covered broker-dealer (including non-customer accounts and any
associated property) as the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine to be appropriate.
Paragraph (c) is based upon the broad authority of the Corporation as receiver to transfer any
assets or liabilities of the covered broker-dealer to a bridge financial company in accordance
with, and subject to the requirements of, section 210(h)(5) of the Dodd-Frank Act 69 and is
designed to facilitate the receiver’s ability to continue the covered broker-dealer’s operations,
67

See §§ 380.63(b) and 302.103(b), as proposed. See also 12 U.S.C 5390(a)(1)(O)(i)(I) and (II) (listing the
specific conditions under which customer accounts would not be transferred to a bridge financial company
if it was organized).

68

12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(1)(O)(i)(I) and (II).

69

See 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(5)(A) (providing that the receiver “may transfer any assets and liabilities of a
covered financial company”). The statute sets forth certain restrictions and limitations that are not affected
by this proposed rule. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(1)(B)(ii) (restricting the assumption of liabilities that
count as regulatory capital by the bridge financial company) and 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(5)(F) (requiring that
the aggregate liabilities transferred to the bridge financial company may not exceed the aggregate amount
of assets transferred).
20

minimize systemic risk, and maximize the value of the assets of the receivership. 70 The transfer
of assets and liabilities to a bridge broker-dealer under the proposed rule would enable the
receiver to continue the day-to-day operations of the broker-dealer and facilitate the
maximization of the value of the assets of the receivership by making it possible to avoid a
forced or other distressed sale of the assets of the covered broker-dealer. In addition, the ability
to continue the operations of the covered broker-dealer may help mitigate the impact of the
failure of the covered broker-dealer on other market participants and financial market utilities
and thereby minimize systemic risk.
Finally, paragraph (c) of this section of the proposed rule clarifies that the transfer to a
bridge broker-dealer of any account or property pursuant to this section does not create any
implication that the holder of such an account qualifies as a “customer” or that the property so
transferred qualifies as “customer property” or “customer name securities” within the meaning of
SIPA or within the meaning of the rule. Under Title II, the Corporation may transfer all the
assets of a covered broker-dealer to a bridge broker-dealer. 71 Such a transfer of assets may
include, for example, securities that were sold to the covered broker-dealer under reverse
repurchase agreements. Under the terms of a typical reverse repurchase agreement, it is common

70

See §§ 380.63(f) and 302.103(f), as proposed. See also 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(5) (granting authority to the
Corporation as receiver to transfer assets and liabilities of a covered financial company to a bridge financial
company). Similarly, under Title II, the Corporation, as receiver for a covered broker-dealer, may approve
articles of association for such bridge broker-dealer. See 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(2)(H)(i). The bridge brokerdealer would also be subject to the federal securities laws and all requirements with respect to being a
member of a self-regulatory organization, unless exempted from any such requirements by the Commission
as is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. See 12 U.S.C.
5390(h)(2)(H)(ii).

71

See 12 U.S.C 5390(h)(2)(H) and 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(5) (granting authority to the Corporation as receiver to
transfer assets and liabilities of a covered broker-dealer).
21

for the broker-dealer to be able to use the purchased securities for its own purposes. In contrast,
Commission rules specifically protect customer funds and securities and essentially forbid
broker-dealers from using customer assets to finance any part of their businesses unrelated to
servicing securities customers. 72 An integral component of the broker-dealer customer
protection regime is that, under SIPA, customers have preferred status relative to general
creditors with respect to customer property and customer name securities. 73 Given the preferred
status of customers, litigation has arisen regarding whether, consistent with the above example,
claims of repo counterparties are “customer” claims under SIPA. 74 In implementing section 205
of the Dodd-Frank Act, consistent with the statutory directive contained therein, 75 the
Corporation and the Commission are seeking to ensure that customers of the covered brokerdealer under Title II are treated in a manner at least as beneficial as would have been the case
had the broker-dealer been liquidated under SIPA. 76 Accordingly, the Commission and the
Corporation are proposing to preserve customer status as would be the case in a SIPA
proceeding. Thus, the proposed rule clarifies that moving assets to a bridge financial company
as part of a Title II orderly liquidation is not determinative as to whether the holder of such an
account qualifies as a “customer” or if the property so transferred qualifies as “customer

in the orderly liquidation of a covered broker-dealer would depend upon whether the claimant
would be a customer under SIPA. 77
2.

Other Provisions with respect to Bridge Broker-Dealer

The proposed rule addresses certain matters relating to account transfers to the bridge
broker-dealer. 78 The process set forth in this part of the proposed rule is designed to put the
customer in the position the customer would have been in had the broker-dealer been liquidated
in a SIPA proceeding. 79 In a SIPA proceeding, the trustee would generally handle customer
accounts in two ways. First, a trustee may sell or otherwise transfer to another SIPC member,
without the consent of any customer, all or any part of a customer’s account, as a way to return
customer property to the control of the customer. 80 Such account transfers are separate from the
customer claim process. Customer account transfers are useful insofar as they serve to allow
customers to resume trading more quickly and minimize disruption in the securities markets. If
it is not practicable to transfer customer accounts, then the second way of returning customer
property to the control of customers is through the customer claims process. Under bankruptcy

77

See 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(B) (SIPA definition of customer). See also 12 U.S.C. 5381(a)(10) (defining
customer, customer name securities, customer property, and net equity in the context of a covered brokerdealer as the same meanings such terms have in section 16 of SIPA (15 U.S.C. 78lll)); In re Bernard L.
Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC, 654 F.3d 229, 236 (2d Cir. 2011).

SIPA).

court supervision, the SIPA trustee will determine each customer’s net equity and the amount of
customer property available for customers. 81 Once the SIPA trustee determines that a claim is a
customer claim (an “allowed customer claim”), the customer will be entitled to a ratable share of
the fund of customer property. As discussed above, SIPA defines “customer property” to
generally include all the customer-related property held by the broker-dealer. 82 Allowed
customer claims are determined on the basis of a customer’s net equity, 83 which, as described
above, generally is the dollar value of a customer’s account on the filing date of the SIPA
proceeding less indebtedness of the customer to the broker-dealer on the filing date. 84 Once the
trustee determines the fund of customer property and customer net equity claims, the trustee can
establish each customer’s pro rata share of the fund of customer property. Customer net equity
claims generally are satisfied to the extent possible by providing the customer with the identical
securities owned by that customer as of the day the SIPA proceeding was commenced. 85
Although a Title II orderly liquidation is under a different statutory authority, the process
for determining and satisfying customer claims would follow a substantially similar process to a
SIPA proceeding. Upon the commencement of a SIPA liquidation, customers’ cash and
securities held by the broker-dealer are returned to customers on a pro rata basis. 86 If sufficient
funds are not available at the broker-dealer to satisfy customer net equity claims, SIPC advances

would be used to supplement the distribution, up to a ceiling of $500,000 per customer, including
a maximum of $250,000 for cash claims. 87 When applicable, SIPC will return securities that are
registered in the customer’s name or are in the process of being registered directly to each
customer. 88 As in a SIPA proceeding, in a Title II liquidation of a covered broker-dealer, the
process of determining net equity would thus begin with a calculation of customers’ net equity.
A customer’s net equity claim against a covered broker-dealer would be deemed to be satisfied
and discharged to the extent that customer property of the covered broker-dealer, along with
property made available through advances from SIPC, is transferred and allocated to the
customer’s account at the bridge broker-dealer. The bridge broker-dealer would undertake the
obligations of the covered broker-dealer only with respect to such property. The Corporation, as
receiver, in consultation with SIPC, as trustee, would allocate customer property and property
made available through advances from SIPC in a manner consistent with SIPA and with SIPC’s
normal practices thereunder. The calculation of net equity would not be affected by the
assumption of liability by the bridge broker-dealer to each customer in connection with the
property transferred to the bridge broker-dealer. The use of the bridge broker-dealer is designed
to give customers access to their accounts as quickly as practicable, while ensuring that
customers receive assets in the form and amount that they would receive in a SIPA liquidation. 89

This outcome would satisfy the requirements of section 205(f)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act. See 12 U.S.C.
5385(f)(1) (stating that notwithstanding any other provision of this title, all obligations of a covered broker
or dealer or of any bridge financial company established with respect to such covered broker or dealer to a
customer relating to, or net equity claims based upon, customer property or customer name securities shall
be promptly discharged by SIPC, the Corporation, or the bridge financial company, as applicable, by the
delivery of securities or the making of payments to or for the account of such customer, in a manner and in

The proposed rule also provides that allocations to customer accounts at the bridge
broker-dealer may initially be derived from estimates based upon the books and records of the
covered broker-dealer or other information deemed relevant by the Corporation as receiver, in
consultation with SIPC as trustee. 90 This approach is based upon experience with SIPA
liquidations where, for example, there were difficulties reconciling the broker-dealer’s records
with the records of central counterparties or other counterparties or other factors that caused
delay in verifying customer accounts. 91 This provision of the proposed rule is designed to
facilitate access to accounts for the customers at the bridge broker-dealer as soon as is
practicable under the circumstances while facilitating the refinement of the calculation of
allocations of customer property to customer accounts as additional information becomes
available. This process will help ensure both that customers have access to their customer
accounts as quickly as practicable and that customer property ultimately will be fairly and
accurately allocated.
The proposed rule also states that the bridge broker-dealer undertakes the obligations of a
covered broker-dealer with respect to each person holding an account transferred to the bridge
broker-dealer, but only to the extent of the property (and SIPC funds) so transferred and held by

an amount at least as beneficial to the customer as would have been the case had the actual proceeds
realized from the liquidation of the covered broker or dealer under this title been distributed in a proceeding
under SIPA without the appointment of the Corporation as receiver and without any transfer of assets or
liabilities to a bridge financial company, and with a filing date as of the date on which the Corporation is
appointed as receiver.).

the bridge broker-dealer with respect to that person’s account. 92 This portion of the proposed
rule provides customers of the bridge broker-dealer with the assurance that the securities laws
relating to the protection of customer property will apply to customers of a bridge broker-dealer
in the same manner as they apply to customers of a broker-dealer which is being liquidated
outside of Title II. 93 The Agencies believe that such assurances would help to reduce uncertainty
regarding the protections that will be offered to customers.
This portion of the proposed rule also provides that the bridge broker-dealer would not
have any obligations with respect to any customer property or other property that is not
transferred from the covered broker-dealer to the bridge broker-dealer. 94 A customer’s net
equity claim remains with the covered broker-dealer and, in most cases, would be satisfied, in
whole or in part, by transferring the customer’s account together with customer property, to the
bridge broker-dealer. 95 In the event that a customer’s account and the associated account
property is not so transferred, the customer’s net equity claim would be subject to satisfaction by
SIPC as the trustee for the covered broker-dealer in the same manner and to the same extent as in
a SIPA proceeding. 96

The bridge broker-dealer section of the proposed rule 97 also provides that the transfer of
assets or liabilities of a covered broker-dealer, including customer accounts and all associated
customer name securities and customer property, assets and liabilities held by a covered brokerdealer for non-customer creditors, and assets and liabilities associated with any trust or custody
business, to a bridge broker-dealer, would be effective without any consent, authorization, or
approval of any person or entity, including but not limited to, any customer, contract party,
governmental authority, or court. 98 This section is based on the Corporation’s authority, under
three separate statutory provisions of Title II. 99 The broad language of this paragraph of the
proposed rule is intended to give full effect to the statutory provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act
regarding transfers of assets and liabilities of a covered financial company, 100 which represent an
important recognition by Congress that, in order to ensure the financial stability of the United
States following the failure of a covered financial company, the Corporation as receiver must be
free to determine which contracts, assets, and liabilities of the covered financial company are to
be transferred to a bridge financial company, and to transfer such contracts, assets, and liabilities
expeditiously and irrespective of whether any other person or entity consents to or approves of

See §§ 380.63(e) and 302.103(e), as proposed.

power to transfer customer accounts and customer property without customer consent is also found in
SIPA. See 15 U.S.C. 78fff-2(f).

100

The proposed rule text omits the reference to “further” approvals found in 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(5)(D). The
reference in the statute is to the government approvals needed in connection with organizing the bridge
financial company, such as the approval of the articles of association and by-laws, as established under 12
U.S.C. 5390(h). These approvals will already have been obtained prior to any transfer under the proposed
rule, making the reference to “further” approvals unnecessary and superfluous.

28

the transfer. The impracticality of requiring the Corporation as receiver to obtain the consent or
approval of others in order to effectuate a transfer of the failed company’s contracts, assets, and
liabilities arises whether the consent or approval otherwise would be required as a consequence
of laws, regulations, or contractual provisions, including as a result of options, rights of first
refusal, or similar contractual rights, or any other restraints on alienation or transfer. Paragraph
(e) would apply regardless of the identity of the holder of the restraint on alienation or transfer,
whether such holder is a local, state, federal or foreign government, a governmental department
or other governmental body of any sort, a court or other tribunal, a corporation, partnership, trust,
or other type of company or entity, or an individual, and regardless of the source of the restraint
on alienation or transfer, whether a statute, regulation, common law, or contract. It is the
Corporation’s view that the transfer of any contract to a bridge financial company would not
result in a breach of the contract and would not give rise to a claim or liability for damages. In
addition, under section 210(h)(2)(E) of the Dodd-Frank Act, no additional assignment or further
assurance is required of any person or entity to effectuate such a transfer of assets or liabilities by
the Corporation as receiver for the covered broker-dealer. Paragraph (e) of the proposed rule
would facilitate the prompt transfer of assets and liabilities of a covered broker-dealer to a bridge
broker-dealer and enhance the Corporation’s ability to maintain critical operations of the covered
broker-dealer. Rapid action to set-up a bridge broker-dealer and transfer assets, including
customer accounts and customer property, may be critical to preserving financial stability and to
giving customers the promptest possible access to their accounts.
Paragraph (f) of the bridge broker-dealer provision of the proposed rule provides for the
succession of the bridge broker-dealer to the rights, powers, authorities, or privileges of the
29

covered broker-dealer. 101 This provision of the proposed rule draws directly from authority
provided in Title II and is designed to facilitate the ability of the Corporation as receiver to
operate the bridge broker-dealer. 102 Pursuant to paragraph (g) of the bridge broker-dealer
provision, 103 the bridge broker-dealer would also be subject to the federal securities laws and all
requirements with respect to being a member of a self-regulatory organization, unless exempted
from any such requirements by the Commission as is necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors. 104 This provision of the proposed rule also draws
closely upon Title II. 105
Paragraph (h) of the bridge broker-dealer provision of the proposed rule states that at the
end of the term of existence of the bridge broker-dealer, any proceeds or other assets that remain
after payment of all administrative expenses of the bridge broker-dealer and all other claims
against the bridge broker-dealer would be distributed to the Corporation as receiver for the
related covered broker-dealer. 106 Stated differently, the residual value in the bridge brokerdealer after payment of its obligations would benefit the creditors of the covered broker-dealer in
satisfaction of their claims.

E.

Claims of Customers and Other Creditors of a Covered Broker-Dealer 107

The proposed section on the claims of the covered broker-dealer’s customers and other
creditors would address the claims process for those customers and other creditors as well as the
respective roles of the trustee and the receiver with respect to those claims. 108 The proposed
section would provide SIPC with the authority as trustee for the covered broker-dealer to make
determinations, allocations, and advances in a manner consistent with its customary practices in
a liquidation under SIPA. 109 Specifically, the proposed section provides that the allocation of
customer property, advances from SIPC, and delivery of customer name securities to each
customer or to its customer account at a bridge broker or dealer, in partial or complete
satisfaction of such customer’s net equity claims as of the close of business on the appointment
date, shall be in a manner, including form and timing, and in an amount at least as beneficial to
such customer as would have been the case had the covered broker or dealer been liquidated
under SIPA. 110 Each customer of a covered broker-dealer would receive cash and securities at
least equal in amount and value, as of the appointment date, to what that customer would have
received in a SIPA proceeding. 111

107

If adopted, the section of the proposed rule on claims of customers and other creditors of a covered brokerdealer will appear in 12 CFR 380.64 for purposes of the Corporation and 17 CFR 302.104 for purposes of
the Commission. The rule text in both CFRs will be identical.

This proposed section further addresses certain procedural aspects of the claims
determination process in accordance with the requirements set forth in section 210(a)(2) through
(5) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 112 The proposed section describes the role of the receiver of a
covered broker-dealer with respect to claims and provides for the publication and mailing of
notices to creditors of the covered broker-dealer by the receiver in a manner consistent with both
SIPA and the notice procedures applicable to covered financial companies generally under
section 210(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 113 The proposed section provides that the notice of the
Corporation’s appointment as receiver must be accompanied by notice of SIPC’s appointment as
trustee. 114 In addition, the Corporation, as receiver, would consult with SIPC, as trustee,
regarding procedures for filing a claim including the form of claim and the filing instructions, to
facilitate a process that is consistent with SIPC’s general practices. 115 The claim form would
include a provision permitting a claimant to claim customer status, if applicable, but the
inclusion of any such claim to customer status on the claim form would not be determinative of
customer status under SIPA.
The proposed rule would set the claims bar date as the date following the expiration of
the six-month period beginning on the date that the notice to creditors is first published. 116 The
claims bar date in the proposed rule is consistent with section 8(a) of SIPA, which provides for

112

12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2) through (5).

113

See §§ 380.64(b) and 302.104(b), as proposed. See also 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2).

114

See §§ 380.64(b)(1) and 302.104(b)(1), as proposed (“The Corporation as receiver shall coordinate with

the barring of claims after the expiration of the six-month period beginning upon publication. 117
The six-month period is also consistent with section 210(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act,
which requires that the claims bar date be no less than ninety days after first publication. 118 As
required by section 210(a)(3)(C)(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the proposed rule provides that any
claim filed after the claims bar date shall be disallowed, and such disallowance shall be final,
except that a claim filed after the claims bar date would be considered by the receiver if (i) the
claimant did not receive notice of the appointment of the receiver in time to file a claim before
the claim date, and (ii) the claim is filed in time to permit payment of the claim, as provided by
section 210(a)(3)(C)(ii) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 119 This exception for late-filed claims due to
lack of notice to the claimant would serve a similar purpose (i.e., to ensure a meaningful
opportunity for claimants to participate in the claims process) as the “reasonable, fixed extension
of time” that may be granted to the otherwise applicable six-month deadline under SIPA to
certain specified classes of claimants. 120
Section 8(a)(3) of SIPA provides that a customer who wants to assure that its net equity
claim is paid out of customer property must file its claim with the SIPA trustee within a period of
time set by the court (not exceeding 60 days after the date of publication of the notice provided
in section 8(a)(1) of SIPA) notwithstanding that the claims bar date is later. 121 The proposed rule
conforms to this section of SIPA by providing that any claim for net equity filed more than 60

days after the notice to creditors is first published need not be paid or satisfied in whole or in part
out of customer property and, to the extent such claim is paid by funds advanced by SIPC, it
would be satisfied in cash or securities, or both, as SIPC, the trustee, determines is most
economical to the receivership estate. 122
Under the proposed rule, the Corporation as receiver would be required to notify a
claimant whether it allows a claim within the 180-day period 123 as such time period may be
extended by written agreement, 124 or the expedited 90-day period, 125 whichever would be
applicable. The process established for the determination of claims by customers of a covered
broker-dealer for customer property or customer name securities would constitute the exclusive
process for the determination of such claims. 126 This process corresponds to the SIPA provision
that requires that customer claims to customer property be determined pro rata based on each
customer’s net equity applied to all customer property as a whole. 127 While the Dodd-Frank Act
provides for expedited treatment of certain claims within 90 days, given that all customers may
have preferred status with respect to customer property and customer name securities, no one
customer’s claim, or group of customer claims, would be treated in an expedited manner ahead
of other customers’ claims.

Consequently, the concept of expedited relief would not apply to

customer claims. 128 The receiver’s determination to allow or disallow a claim in whole or in part
would utilize the determinations made by SIPC, as trustee, with respect to customer status,
claims for net equity, claims for customer name securities, and whether property held by the
covered broker-dealer qualifies as customer property. 129 A claimant may seek a de novo judicial
review of any claim that is disallowed in whole or in part by the receiver, including but not
limited to any claim disallowed in whole or part based upon any determination made by SIPC. 130
F.

Additional Proposed Sections

In addition to the previously discussed proposed sections, the Agencies propose to
include sections in the proposed rule addressing: (1) the priorities for unsecured claims against a
covered broker-dealer; 131 (2) the administrative expenses of SIPC; 132 and (3) QFCs. 133 The
Dodd-Frank Act sets forth special priorities for the payment of claims of general unsecured
creditors of a covered broker-dealer, which would be addressed in the proposed section on

the United States). See also 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(4) and (5).

If adopted, the priorities for unsecured claims against a covered broker-dealer section will appear in 12
CFR 380.65 for purposes of the Corporation and 17 CFR 302.105 for purposes of the Commission. The

priorities for unsecured claims against a covered broker-dealer. 134 The priorities for unsecured
claims against a covered broker-dealer include claims for unsatisfied net equity of a customer
and certain administrative expenses of the receiver and SIPC. 135 The priorities set forth in the
proposed rule express the cumulative statutory requirements set forth in Title II. 136 First, the
priorities provide that the administrative expenses of SIPC as trustee for a covered broker-dealer
would be reimbursed pro rata with administrative expenses of the receiver for the covered
broker-dealer. 137 Second, the amounts paid by the Corporation as receiver to customers or SIPC
would be reimbursed on a pro rata basis with amounts owed to the United States, including
amounts borrowed from the U.S. Treasury for the orderly liquidation fund. 138 Third, the
amounts advanced by SIPC for the satisfaction of customer net equity claims would be
reimbursed subsequent to amounts owed to the United States, but before all other claims. 139
Title II provides that SIPC is entitled to recover administrative expenses incurred in
performing its responsibilities under section 205 on an equal basis with the Corporation. 140 Title

See 12 U.S.C. 5390(b)(6)(A). The regulation governing the Corporation’s administrative expenses in its
role as receiver under Title II is located at 12 CFR 380.22.
36

II also sets forth a description of the administrative expenses of the receiver. 141 In order to
provide additional clarity as to the types of administrative expenses that SIPC would be entitled
to recover in connection with its role as trustee for the covered broker-dealer, the proposed rule
provides that SIPC, in connection with its role as trustee for the covered broker-dealer, has the
authority to “utilize the services of private persons, including private attorneys, accountants,
consultants, advisors, outside experts and other third party professionals.” The section further
provides SIPC with an allowed administrative expense claim with respect to any amounts paid
by SIPC for services provided by these persons if those services are “practicable, efficient and
cost-effective.” 142 The proposed definition of administrative expenses of SIPC conforms to both
the definition of administrative expenses of the Corporation as receiver and the costs and
expenses of administration reimbursable to SIPC as trustee in the liquidation of a broker-dealer
under SIPA. 143 Specifically, the proposed definition includes “the costs and expenses of such
attorneys, accountants, consultants, advisors, outside experts and other third parties, and other
proper expenses that would be allowable to a third party trustee under 15 U.S.C. 78eee(b)(5)(A),
including the costs and expenses of SIPC employees that would be allowable pursuant to 15
U.S.C. 78fff(e).” 144 The proposed definition excludes advances from SIPC to satisfy customer

claims for net equity because the Dodd-Frank Act specifies that those advances are treated
differently than administrative expenses with respect to the priority of payment. 145
Lastly, the proposed section on QFCs states that QFCs are governed in accordance with
Title II. 146 Paragraph (b)(4) of section 205 of the Dodd-Frank Act states in pertinent part: that
notwithstanding any provision of SIPA the rights and obligations of any party to a qualified
financial contract (as the term is defined in section 210(c)(8)) to which a covered broker or
dealer for which the Corporation has been appointed receiver is a party shall be governed
exclusively by section 210, including the limitations and restrictions contained in section
210(c)(10)(B). 147 Paragraph (c)(8)(A) of section 210 states that no person shall be stayed or
prohibited from exercising – (i) any right that such person has to cause the termination,
liquidation, or acceleration of any qualified financial contract with a covered financial company
which arises upon the date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver for such covered
financial company or at any time after such appointment; (ii) any right under any security
agreement or arrangement or other credit enhancement related to one or more qualified financial
contracts described in clause (i); or (iii) any right to offset or net out any termination value,
payment amount, or other transfer obligation arising under or in connection with one or more
contracts or agreements described in clause (i), including any master agreement for such

exclusively by section 210 [of the Dodd-Frank Act]”).
38

contracts or agreements. 148 Paragraph (c)(10)(B)(i)(I)-(II) of section 210 provides in pertinent
part that a person who is a party to a QFC with a covered financial company may not exercise
any right that such person has to terminate, liquidate, or net such contract under paragraph
(c)(8)(A) of section 210 solely by reason of or incidental to the appointment under Title II of the
Corporation as receiver for the covered financial company: (1) until 5:00 p.m. eastern time on
the business day following the date of the appointment; or (2) after the person has received
notice that the contract has been transferred pursuant to paragraph (c)(9)(A) of section 210. 149
The proposed rule reflects these statutory directives and states that the rights and obligations of
any party to a qualified financial contract to which a covered broker or dealer is a party shall be
governed exclusively by 12 U.S.C. 5390, including the limitations and restrictions contained in
12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(10)(B), and any regulations promulgated thereunder. 150

In addition to the general request for comments, the Agencies request comment with
respect to the following specific questions:
1. In light of section 205(f)(1)’s requirement that customers in a section 205 orderly
liquidation receive distributions that are at least as beneficial as what they would have
received in a SIPA liquidation, are there any circumstances in which the application of
the proposed rule would result in delivery or distributions to customers of securities or
cash, in connection with net equity claims, customer property or customer name
securities, in a manner and in an amount less than such customers would receive if the
covered broker-dealer were subject to a SIPA liquidation? If yes, what are those
circumstances? Please be specific.
2. Would an orderly liquidation of a broker-dealer under the approach described in the
proposed rule have any unintended or adverse impact(s) on customers or other classes of
claimants? If yes, what are those impacts? Are there other approach(es) that might be
consistent with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and have fewer such impacts?
What are the other approach(es) that might eliminate or minimize such unintended or
adverse impact(s), and how would they do so? Please be specific. What would be the
costs or benefits associated with such alternative approaches?

costs or benefits associated with such alternative approaches?
4. Are there any matter(s) with respect to the orderly liquidation of a covered broker-dealer
under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act that are not currently addressed in the proposed rule,
but that should be addressed in a rulemaking under section 205(h) of the Dodd-Frank
Act, 12 U.S.C. 5385(h)? If yes, what are those matters, why should they be addressed,
and how? Please be specific.

the proposed rule be made clearer?
6. Does the proposed rule clearly address the treatment of customers and other classes of
claimants and creditors in a Title II orderly liquidation of a covered broker-dealer? Does
the proposed rule clearly address the claims bar date and the 60-day filing deadline for
payment of net equity claims out of customer property? If not, in what respects could the
proposed rule be made clearer and how?
7. Are the priorities for the allocation of customer property and other assets of the covered
broker-dealer clearly addressed by the proposed rule? If not, in what respects could they
be made clearer and how?

9. Are the matters listed for inclusion in the protective decree appropriate? Are there any
other matters not mentioned that should be included in the protective decree, and if so,
why? Could the provision of the protective decree clarifying that, if a protective decree
were filed on a date other than the appointment date, the protective decree’s filing date
would be deemed be the appointment date, cause harm to customers, other claimants,
creditors, shareholders, or other interested parties? If so, how? Are there alternative
approaches that would not have such impacts? If yes, please describe in detail and
provide information about associated costs or benefits.
10. Would customers be harmed by their inability to seek determinations of their claims
within the expedited 90-day period (as provided by section 210(a)(5)(B) of the DoddFrank Act) rather than within six-months (as provided by section 210(a)(3)(A)(i) of the
Dodd-Frank Act)? If so, how? If customers were permitted to seek expedited
determinations of their claims, would that allow them to “jump ahead” of other similarlysituated claimants? Would that be appropriate?
11. What are the expected costs to covered broker-dealers as a result of this proposed rule?
12. Are there any costs or benefits of the proposed rule for customers or other creditors of
covered broker-dealers, or market participants generally, that are not described above?

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
42

The proposed rule would clarify the process for the orderly liquidation of a covered
broker-dealer under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rule addresses only the
process to be used in the liquidation of the covered broker-dealer and does not create any new, or
revise any existing, collection of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act. 151
Consequently, no information has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for
review.
The Agencies request comment on the assertion that the proposed rule will not create any
new, or revise any existing, collection of information pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

A.

Introduction and General Economic Considerations

The Commission and the Corporation are jointly proposing this rule to implement
provisions applicable to the orderly liquidation of covered broker-dealers pursuant to section
205(h) of the Dodd-Frank Act in manner that protects market participants by clearly establishing
expectations and equitable treatment for customers and creditors of failed broker-dealers, as well
as other market participants. The Commission and the Corporation are mindful of the costs and
benefits of their respective rules. The following economic analysis seeks to identify and
consider the benefits and costs – including the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation – that would result from the proposed rule. Overall, the Commission and the
Corporation preliminarily believe that the primary benefit of the proposed rule is to codify
151

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
43

additional details regarding the process for orderly liquidation of failed broker-dealers which will
provide additional structure and enable consistent application of the process. Importantly, the
proposed rule does not affect the set of options available to the Commission and the Corporation,
nor does it affect the range of possible outcomes. The detailed analysis of costs and benefits
regarding the proposed rule is discussed below.
The Dodd-Frank Act specifically provides that the FDIC may be appointed receiver for a
systemically important broker-dealer for purposes of the orderly liquidation of the company
using the powers and authorities granted to the FDIC under Title II of the Act. 152 Section 205 of
the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth a process for the orderly liquidation of covered broker-dealers that
is an alternative to the process under SIPA, but that process incorporates many of the customer
protection features of SIPA into a Title II orderly liquidation. Congress recognized that brokerdealers are different from other kinds of systemically important financial companies in several
ways, not the least of which is how customers of a broker-dealer are treated in an insolvency
proceeding relating to the broker-dealer. 153 Section 205 of the Dodd-Frank Act is intended to
address situations where the failure of a large broker-dealer could have broader impacts on the
stability of the United States financial system. The financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing
economic recession resulted in the failure of many financial entities. Liquidity problems that
initially began at a small set of firms quickly spread as uncertainty about which institutions were
solvent increased, triggering broader market disruptions, including a general loss of liquidity,

153

See 12 U.S.C. 5385 (orderly liquidation of covered brokers and dealers).
44

distressed asset sales, and system-wide redemption runs by some participants. 154 The proposed
rule seeks to implement the orderly liquidation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act in a manner
that is designed to help reduce both the likelihood and the severity of financial market
disruptions that could result from the failure of a covered broker-dealer.
In the case of a failing broker-dealer, the broker-dealer customer protection regime is
primarily composed of SIPA and the Exchange Act, as administered by SIPC and the
Commission. Among other Commission financial responsibility rules, Rule 15c3-3 specifically
protects customer funds and securities held by a broker-dealer and essentially forbids brokerdealers from using customer assets to finance any part of their businesses unrelated to servicing
securities customers. 155 With respect to SIPA, and as a general matter, in the event that a brokerdealer enters into a SIPA liquidation, customers’ cash and securities held by the broker-dealer
are returned to customers on a pro-rata basis. 156 If the broker-dealer does not have sufficient
funds to satisfy customer net equity claims, SIPC advances may be used to supplement the
distribution, up to a ceiling of $500,000 per customer, including a maximum of $250,000 for
cash claims. 157 When applicable, SIPC or a SIPA trustee will return securities that are registered
in the customer’s name, or are in the process of being registered, directly to each customer. 158

An integral component of the broker-dealer customer protection regime is that, under SIPA,
customers have preferred status relative to general creditors with respect to customer property
and customer name securities. 159 SIPC or a SIPA trustee may sell or transfer customer accounts
to another SIPC member in order for the customers to regain access to their accounts in an
expedited fashion. 160
Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act supplemented the customer protection regime for brokerdealers. As described above in more detail, in the event a covered broker-dealer fails, 161 Title II
provides the FDIC with a broader set of tools to help ensure orderly liquidation, including the
ability to transfer all assets and liabilities held by a broker-dealer– not just customer assets – to
another broker-dealer, as well as the ability to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. 162 Upon the
commencement of an orderly liquidation under Title II, the FDIC is appointed the receiver of the
broker-dealer and SIPC is appointed as the trustee for the liquidation process. The FDIC is given

161

To facilitate their customer business and to finance their proprietary trading activities, broker-dealers often
enter into short-term borrowing arrangements, including repurchase and securities lending agreements.
Such financing arrangements can have maturities as short as a day, requiring broker-dealers to continuously
refinance their positions. Broker-dealers are therefore subject to liquidity risk in the event that short-term
lenders and counterparties refuse to finance their positions or seek less favorable terms for the brokerdealer, such as higher haircuts on collateral. Doubts about a broker-dealer’s viability can lead a brokerdealer’s customers to move their accounts from the broker-dealer, placing additional strains upon the
broker-dealer’s liquidity position. Such doubts can, in turn, lead to a general “run” against the brokerdealer, both in its secured financing activities and withdrawals of customer accounts. The ability of the
Corporation under Title II to provide financing to the broker-dealer and to allow the broker-dealer to
continue its operations may help to address the liquidity stress at the broker-dealer and reduce the potential
risk to other market participants.

162

Under a SIPA liquidation, the Commission is authorized to make loans to SIPC should SIPC lack sufficient
funds. In addition, to fund these loans, the Commission is authorized to borrow up to $2.5 billion from the
U.S. Treasury. See 15 U.S.C. 78ddd(g) and (h).

the authority to form and fund a bridge broker-dealer, 163 which would facilitate a quick transfer
of customer accounts to a solvent broker-dealer and therefore would accelerate reinstated access
to customer accounts. 164 By granting the FDIC the ability to transfer any asset or liability to the
bridge broker-dealer as it deems necessary, the orderly liquidation proceeding allows the
Corporation to extend relief to certain creditors to reduce the destabilizing effects these creditors
may cause if they run on a large broker-dealer. 165 To further reduce the run risk the failed
broker-dealer may be facing, Title II imposes an automatic one-business day stay on certain
activities by the counterparties to QFCs, so as to provide the FDIC an opportunity to inform
counterparties that the covered broker-dealer’s liabilities were transferred to and assumed by the
bridge broker-dealer. 166
The proposed rule is designed to implement the provisions of section 205, so that an
orderly liquidation can be carried out for certain broker-dealers with efficiency and the intended
benefits of orderly liquidation, as established by the Dodd-Frank Act, on the overall economy
can be realized. Specifically, the proposed rule implements the framework for the liquidation of
covered broker-dealers. The framework includes definitions for the key terms such as customer,
customer property, customer name securities, net equity, and bridge broker-dealer. It sets forth
three major processes regarding the orderly liquidation – the process of initiating the orderly
liquidation (including the appointment of receiver and trustee and the notice and application for

protective decree), the process of account transfers to the bridge broker-dealer, and the claims
process for customers and other creditors. While establishing orderly liquidation generally,
section 205 does not specifically provide the details of such processes.
The proposed rule provides several clarifications to the provisions in the statute. For
example, under Title II, the FDIC has authority to transfer any assets without obtaining any
approval, assignment, or consents. 167 The proposed rule further provides that the transfer to a
bridge broker-dealer of any account, property or asset is not determinative of customer status,
nor that the property so transferred qualifies as customer property or customer name securities. 168
The proposed rule also provides clarifications on terms such as the venue for filing the
application for a protective decree and the filing date. 169
In addition, the proposed rule clarifies the process for transferring assets to the bridge
broker-dealer, which should help expedite customer access to their respective accounts. For
example, the proposed rule provides that allocations to customer accounts at the bridge brokerdealer may initially be derived from estimates based upon the books and records of the covered
broker-dealer or other information deemed relevant by the Corporation in consultation with
SIPC. 170 This means that customers may potentially access their accounts more expeditiously,
before the time-consuming record reconciliation process concludes.

167

See §§ 380.63 and 302.103, as proposed.

168

These determinations would be made by SIPC in accordance with SIPA. See §§ 380.64(a)(1) and 302.104,
as proposed (explaining that SIPC, as trustee for a covered broker or dealer, would determine customer
status).

169

See §§ 380.62 and 302.102, as proposed.

170

See §§ 380.63(d) and 302.103(d), as proposed.
48

Therefore, overall, the Commission and the Corporation preliminarily believe that the
primary benefit of the proposed rule is to codify additional details regarding the process for the
orderly liquidation of covered broker-dealers, which will provide additional structure and enable
consistent application of the process. Importantly, the proposed rule does not affect the set of
options available to the Commission and the Corporation upon failure of a covered brokerdealer, nor does it affect the range of possible outcomes. In the absence of the proposed rule, the
Commission, the Board and the Secretary 171 could still determine that an orderly liquidation
under Title II is appropriate, and the FDIC would still have broad authority to establish a bridge
broker-dealer and transfer all assets and liabilities held by the failed entity. However, in the
absence of the proposed rule, uncertainty could arise regarding the definitions (e.g., the
applicable filing date or the nature of the application for a protective decree) and the claims
process, which could cause delays in the process and undermine the goals of the statute. By
establishing a uniform process for the orderly resolution of a broker-dealer, the proposed rule
should improve the orderly liquidation process while implementing the statutory requirements,
so that orderly liquidations can be carried out with efficiency and predictability. Such efficiency
and predictability should generally ease implementation burdens and conserve resources that
otherwise would have to be expended resolving delays in the claims process or in connection
with any potential litigation that could arise from delays. The discussion below elaborates on the
likely costs and benefits of the proposed rule and its potential impact on efficiency, competition
and capital formation, as well as potential alternatives.

B.

Economic Baseline

To assess the economic impact of the proposed rule, the Commission and the Corporation
are using section 205 of the Dodd-Frank Act as the economic baseline. Section 205 sets forth
provisions specific to the orderly liquidation of certain large broker-dealers and paragraph (h)
directs the Commission and the Corporation, in consultation with SIPC, jointly to issue rules to
fully implement the section. 172 Although no implementing rules are in place, section 205 of the
Dodd-Frank Act was self-effectuating, meaning that the statutory requirements are in effect.
Therefore, the appropriate baseline is the orderly liquidation authority in place pursuant to
section 205, without any implementation rules issued by the Agencies. As outlined in Title II of
the Dodd-Frank Act, irrespective of how the broker-dealer was placed into a Title II resolution,
section 205 regarding the liquidation of broker-dealers and the proposed rule (if adopted) would
always apply to the covered broker-dealer even if section 210 is invoked.
1.

SIPC’s Role

Section 205 provides that upon the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a covered
broker-dealer, the FDIC shall appoint SIPC as trustee for the liquidation of the covered brokerdealer under SIPA without need for any approval. 173 Upon its appointment as trustee, SIPC shall
promptly file with a federal district court an application for protective decree, the terms of which
will jointly be determined by SIPC and the Corporation, in consultation with the Commission.174

50

Section 205 also provides that SIPC shall have all of the powers and duties provided by SIPA,
except with respect to assets and liabilities transferred to the bridge broker-dealer. 175 The
determination of claims and the liquidation of assets retained in the receivership of the covered
broker-dealer and not transferred to the bridge financial company shall be administered under
SIPA. 176
2.

The Corporation’s Power to Establish Bridge Broker-Dealers

Section 205 of the Dodd-Frank Act does not contain specific provisions regarding bridge
broker-dealers. However, section 210 of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that, in connection with
an orderly liquidation, the FDIC has the power to form one or more bridge financial companies,
which includes the power to form bridge broker-dealers with respect to a covered brokerdealer. 177 Under Title II, the FDIC has the authority to transfer any asset or liability held by the
covered financial company without obtaining any approval, assignment, or consent with respect
to such transfer. 178 It is further provided that any customer of a covered broker-dealer whose
account is transferred to a bridge financial company shall have all rights and privileges under
section 205(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act and SIPA that such customer would have had if the
account was not transferred. 179

at least as beneficial to the customer as would have been the case had the broker-dealer been
liquidated in a SIPA proceeding.

Benefits, Costs and Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation
1.

Anticipated Benefits
a. Overall Benefits

The key benefit of the proposed rule is that it creates a more structured framework to
implement section 205 of the Dodd-Frank Act, so that the orderly liquidation of a covered
broker-dealer can be carried out with efficiency and predictability if the need arises. As
discussed in the economic baseline, section 205 provides parameters for the orderly liquidation
of covered broker-dealers, while the proposed rule implements these statutory parameters. The
proposed rule first provides definitions for certain key terms including customer, customer
property, customer name securities, net equity, and bridge broker-dealer, among others. 180 It
then sets forth three major processes regarding the orderly liquidation: the process of initiating
the orderly liquidation, 181 the process of account transfers to the bridge broker-dealer, 182 and the
claims process for customers and other creditors. 183

180

See §§ 380.60 and 302.100, as proposed.

181

See §§ 380.61, 380.62, 302.101 and 302.102, as proposed.
52

First, besides incorporating the statutory requirement of appointing SIPC as the trustee
for covered broker-dealers, the proposed rule provides a more detailed process for notice and
application for protective decree. It provides clarification for the venue in which the notice and
application for a decree is to be filed. 184 It clarifies the definition of the filing date if the notice
and application is filed on a date other than the appointment date. 185 And finally, it also includes
a non-exclusive list of notices drawn from other parts of Title II to inform the relevant parties of
the initiation of the orderly liquidation process and what they should expect. 186
Second, the proposed rule sets forth the process to establish one or more bridge brokerdealers and to transfer accounts, property, and other assets held by a covered broker-dealer to
such bridge broker-dealers, pursuant to Title II of Dodd-Frank Act. 187 Section 205 of the Act
does not specifically provide for such a process. The proposed rule specifies that the
Corporation may transfer any account, property, or asset held by a covered broker-dealer
(including customer and non-customer accounts, property and assets) to a bridge broker-dealer as
the Corporation deems necessary, based on the FDIC’s authority under Title II to transfer any
assets without obtaining any approval, assignment, or consents. 188 The transfer to a bridge

53

broker-dealer of any account, property or asset is not determinative of customer status. 189 The
determinations of customer status are to be made by SIPC as trustee in accordance with SIPA. 190
As discussed above, given the preferred status of customers, litigation has been brought on
customer status under SIPA (e.g., repo counterparties’ claims of customer status under SIPA). 191
Since the Corporation may transfer both customer and non-customer accounts, property and
assets held by a covered broker-dealer to a bridge broker-dealer according to the statute, in the
absence of the proposed rule, some non-customer creditors may mistakenly interpret under the
baseline scenario that such a transfer confers customer status (especially since in a SIPA
proceeding only customer assets are transferred). To the extent that such mistaken beliefs may
arise from the statutory provisions, litigation over customer status could arise. The clarification
in the proposed rule stresses that customer status is determined by SIPC separately from the
decision to transfer an asset to a bridge broker-dealer, and could thus help prevent confusion
concerning whether other creditors whose assets have also been transferred should be treated as
customers. This clarification may mitigate a potential increase in litigation costs, although the
economic benefit of such mitigation is likely to be de minimis.
Regarding the account transfers to bridge broker-dealers, in addition to the provisions on
the specifics of a transfer (e.g., the calculation of customer net equity, the assumption of the net
equity claim by the bridge broker-dealer and the allocation of customer property), the proposed
rule further provides that allocations to customer accounts at the bridge broker-dealer may

190

See §§ 380.64(a) and 302.104(a) as proposed.

191

54

initially be derived from estimates based upon the books and records of the covered brokerdealer or other information deemed relevant by the Corporation in consultation with SIPC. 192
Given that it could be time-consuming to reconcile the broker-dealer’s records with the records
of other parties, this provision may speed up the allocation of customer property to the customer
accounts at the bridge broker-dealer, thus providing customers quicker access to their accounts.
Third, the proposed rule also addresses the claims process for customers and other
creditors. 193 The proposed rule implements the statute’s requirement that the trustee’s allocation
shall be in an amount and manner, including form and timing, at least as beneficial as such
customer would have received under a SIPA proceeding, as required by section 205(f). 194 In
addition, it further addresses certain procedural aspects of the claims determination process, such
as the publication and mailing of notices to creditors, the notice of the appointment of the FDIC
and SIPC, the claims bar date, and expedited relief.
In summary, the proposed rule would provide interested parties with details on the
implementation of the orderly liquidation process. By providing for a uniform process, the
proposed rule could improve the orderly liquidation process, so that the orderly liquidation can
be carried out with efficiency and predictability. Under the baseline scenario, in absence of the
proposed rule, uncertainty may arise because various parties may interpret the statutory
requirements differently. For example, under the baseline, the repo counterparties of the brokerdealer may not understand that the transfer of the rights and obligations under their contracts to

192

See §§ 380.63(d) and 302.103(d), as proposed.

193

See §§ 380.64 and 302.104, as proposed.

194

See §§ 380.64(a)(4) and 302.104(a)(4), as proposed.
55

the bridge broker-dealer is not determinative of customer status, because such a transfer to
another broker-dealer is only available for customers under a SIPA proceeding. That is, repo
counterparties of the broker-dealer may mistakenly believe that the transfer of rights and
obligations implies customer status. Accordingly, the proposed rule provides that the transfer of
accounts to a bridge broker-dealer is not determinative of customer status, and that such status is
determined by SIPC in accordance with SIPA. Uncertainty regarding such matters could result
in litigation and delays in the claims process if orderly liquidation were to be commenced with
respect to a covered broker-dealer; therefore, the structure provided by the proposed rule could
conserve resources that otherwise would have to be expended in settling such litigation and
resolving delays that may arise, and create a more efficient process for enabling orderly
liquidation. Moreover, under the baseline scenario, uncertainties about process and how
customer and creditor claims would be handled could continue to encourage these claimants to
reduce exposure if doubts about a broker-dealer’s viability arise – for customers, by withdrawing
free credit balances; for creditors, by reducing repo and derivatives exposure. Such
uncertainties, if they were to persist, could undermine the broader benefits that orderly
liquidation could provide to financial stability. In this sense, the processes set forth by the
proposed rule could help realize the economic benefits of section 205.
b. Benefits to Affected Parties
The Commission and the Corporation believe that the proposed rule provides benefits
comparable to those under the baseline scenario to relevant parties such as customers, creditors,
and counterparties. To the extent that it provides additional guidance on procedural matters, the
proposed rule may reduce potential uncertainty, thereby providing for an efficient and
56

predictable orderly liquidation process. Therefore, the Commission and the Corporation
preliminarily believe the proposed rule will improve the orderly liquidation process and provide
benefits beyond the statute, although such benefits are likely to be incremental.
The Commission and the Corporation preliminarily believe that the proposed rule will be
beneficial to customers. 195 The proposed rule states that the bridge broker-dealer will undertake
the obligations of a covered broker-dealer with respect to each person holding an account
transferred to the bridge broker-dealer, providing customers with transferred accounts assurance
that they will receive the same legal protection and status as a customer of a broker-dealer that is
subject to a liquidation outside of Title II. 196 Further, under the proposed rule, the transfer of
non-customer assets to a bridge broker-dealer would not imply customer status for these assets,
which could thereby reduce any incentive to not move assets based upon fears of prejudging
customer status. Finally, the proposed rule would provide that allocations to customer accounts
at the bridge broker-dealer may initially be derived from estimates based on the books and
records of the covered broker-dealer. 197 This provision could help facilitate expedited customer
access to their respective accounts, as customers would not have to wait for a final reconciliation
of the broker-dealer’s records with other parties’ records. 198

195

See Section II.D.1 discussing the preferred status of customer claims. See also §§ 380.65(a)(1) and
302.105(a)(1), as proposed (explaining that “SIPC . . . shall determine customer status . . .”).

196

See §§ 380.63(d) and 302.103(d), as proposed (“With respect to each account transferred to the bridge
broker or dealer pursuant to paragraph (b), the bridge broker or dealer shall undertake the obligations of a
broker or dealer only with respect to property transferred to and held by the bridge broker or dealer and
allocated to the account as provided in section 380.64(a)(3) [for purposes of the FDIC and section
302.104(a)(3) for purposes of the SEC], including any customer property and any advances from SIPC.”).

197

198

See §§ 380.63(e) and 302.103(e), as proposed. See also 15 U.S.C. 78eee(b)(2)(C)(i) and (ii).
57

The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed rule will yield benefits to both
secured and unsecured creditors, as it clarifies the manner in which creditor claims could be
transferred to a bridge broker-dealer. Creditors thus could potentially receive benefits from
financing provided by the Corporation to the bridge broker-dealer.
2.

Anticipated Costs

While the proposed rule is designed to ensure that an orderly liquidation under Title II
would be at least as beneficial to customers as would be the case in a SIPA liquidation, orderly
liquidation does entail different treatment of QFC counterparties. Under SIPA, certain QFC
counterparties may exercise specified contractual rights regardless of an automatic stay. 199 In
contrast, Title II imposes an automatic one-day stay on certain activities by QFC
counterparties, 200 which may limit the ability of these counterparties to terminate contracts or
exercise any rights against collateral. As proposed, the stay would remain in effect if the QFC
contracts are transferred to a bridge broker-dealer. While these provisions may impose costs,
they are a consequence of the statute and are already in effect.

199

See 15 U.S.C. 78eee(b)(2)(C)(i) through (ii). See also Letter from Michael E. Don, Deputy General
Counsel of SIPC to Robert A. Portnoy, Deputy Executive Director and General Counsel of the Public
Securities Association, dated February 4, 1986 (repurchase agreements); Letter from Michael E. Don to J.

Vice President and Assistant General Counsel of the Bond Market Association, dated June 25, 2002
(repurchase agreements).

200

See §§ 380.67 and 302.107, as proposed.
58

In addition, as discussed above, the proposed rule could benefit customers by allowing
the allocations to customer accounts at the bridge broker-dealer to be derived from estimates
based on the books and records of the covered broker-dealer. Such a process may accelerate
customers’ access to their accounts, as they would not have to wait for a final account
reconciliation to access their accounts. As provided for in the proposed rule, the calculation of
allocations of customer property to customer accounts would be refined as additional information
becomes available. The Commission and the Corporation preliminarily believe that initial
allocations will be made conservatively, which with the backstop of the availability of SIPC
advances to customers in accordance with the requirements of SIPA, should minimize the
possibility of an over-allocation to any customer. To the extent that initial estimates are
excessive, it is possible that customer funds may need to be reallocated after customers initially
gain access to their accounts, which could result in costs for customers. Essentially, the
proposed rule trades off expedited access to customer funds with the possibility of subsequent
reallocation. We currently lack data concerning the impact or costs that might be associated with
this possibility. The costs associated with all of these factors may vary significantly depending
on broker-dealer systems and the specific events. For these reasons, we are unable to quantify
the costs associated with these factors at this time. However, as noted above, the Commission
and the Corporation preliminarily believe initial allocations will be made conservatively, which
would minimize the possibility of an over-allocation to any customer and mitigate potential costs
and uncertainty associated with allocation refinements.
3.

Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

59

The Commission and the Corporation have preliminarily assessed the effects arising from
the proposed rule on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. As discussed above, the
Agencies preliminarily believe the primary economic benefit of the proposed rule will be that it
provides details to implement section 205 of the Dodd-Frank Act, so that the orderly liquidation
of a covered broker-dealer can be carried out with greater efficiency and predictability if the
need arises. This structure could reduce uncertainty about treatment of customer and creditor
claims in an orderly liquidation, conserving resources and creating a more efficient process
relative to orderly liquidation under the baseline. In addition, uncertainty about treatment of
claims could encourage customers and creditors to reduce exposure to a broker-dealer facing
financial distress, exacerbating liquidity problems. By reducing uncertainty, the proposed rule
may reduce incentives for claimants to rush to reduce exposures. In such a scenario, brokerdealers may find it easier to recover from moderate financial distress and to sustain a sufficient
capital position to provide financial intermediation services. Furthermore, for sufficiently large
broker-dealers with many creditor and counterparty relationships throughout the financial
system, positive perceptions about the ability of those broker-dealers to recover from moderate
financial distress may stave off aggregate financial sector runs, and thus preserve financial sector
capital and the availability of financial intermediation services.
Beyond these identified potential effects, the Commission and the Corporation
preliminarily believe that the additional effects of the proposed rule on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation will be linked to the existence of an orderly liquidation process itself,
which is part of the baseline, and is an option available to regulatory authorities today. Our
analysis of the effects of an orderly liquidation process on efficiency, competition, and capital
60

formation focuses on those effects that derive from the process and structure created by the
proposed rule, but not those that are due to the underlying statute, which is part of the economic
baseline. By establishing a structured framework, the proposed rule sets clearer expectations for
relevant parties, and therefore could help reduce potential uncertainty and contribute to market
efficiency and liquidity as described above. Relative to the baseline scenario, where orderly
liquidation exists as an option for regulatory authorities but without the framework provided in
the proposed rule, having a structured process in place as a response to a potential crisis could
also allow broker-dealers to more readily attract funding, thus facilitating capital formation.
D.

Alternatives Considered

As described above, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a process by which a
covered broker-dealer would be placed into orderly liquidation. Furthermore, orderly liquidation
is available as an option to regulators today, and the proposed rule does not affect the set of
options available to the Commission and the Corporation, nor does it affect the range of possible
outcomes. As an alternative to this proposed rule, the Commission and the Corporation could
rely on statutory provisions alone to achieve similar outcomes. However, the Commission and
the Corporation preliminarily believe that relying on the statute alone, without a rule
implementing section 205 of the Dodd-Frank Act, would result in orderly liquidations, if any,
that are less efficient and less predictable, and that would fail to achieve the benefits of the
proposed rule described above. In particular, the absence of the provisions of the proposed rule
outlining the process for notice and application for a protective decree, the process for
establishing a bridge broker-dealer, and the process governing the transfer of accounts, property,
61

and other assets held by the covered broker-dealer to the bridge broker-dealer, could lead to
inconsistent application of the statutory provisions. Such inconsistency could cause delays in the
liquidation process and increase the likelihood of litigation over issues such as customer status,
increasing costs for customers and creditors without corresponding benefits.
E.

Request for Comment

In addition to the general requests for comment, the Commission and the Corporation
request comment with respect to the following specific questions:
1.

As an alternative to the proposed rule, should the Commission and the

Corporation instead rely on the statute alone to implement orderly liquidations of covered
broker-dealers? Why?
2.

Are there additional alternative processes to implement section 205 of the Dodd-

Frank Act that the Commission and the Corporation should consider? If so, what are they and
what would be the associated costs or benefits of these alternative approaches?
VI.

REGULATORY ANALYSIS AND PROCEDURES
A.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 201 requires an agency publishing a notice of
proposed rulemaking to prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility
analysis that describes the impact of the proposed rule on small entities. 202 The RFA provides

201

5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

202

5 U.S.C. 603(a).
62

that an agency is not required to prepare and publish a regulatory flexibility analysis if the
agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. 203
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Agencies certify that the proposed rule, if
adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Under Small Business Administration size standards defining small entities, broker-dealers are
generally considered small entities if their annual receipts do not exceed $38.5 million.204 If
adopted, the proposed rule will clarify rules and procedures for the orderly liquidation of a
covered broker-dealer under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. A covered broker-dealer is a
broker-dealer that is subject to a systemic risk determination by the Secretary pursuant to section
203 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5383, and thereafter is to be liquidated under Title II of
the Dodd-Frank Act. The Agencies do not believe that a broker-dealer that would be considered
a small entity for purposes of the RFA would ever be the subject of a systemic risk determination
by the Secretary. Therefore, the Agencies are not aware of any small entities that would be
affected by the proposed rule. As such, the proposed rule, if adopted, would not affect, and
would impose no burdens on, small entities.

The FDIC has determined that the proposed rule will not affect family well-being within
the meaning of section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act,
enacted as part of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act
of 1999. 205
C.

Plain Language

Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 206 requires federal banking agencies to use
plain language in all proposed and final rules published after January 1, 2000. The FDIC has
sought to present the proposed rule in a simple and straightforward manner but nevertheless
invites comment on whether the proposal is clearly stated and effectively organized, and how the
Agencies might make the proposed text easier to understand.
VII.

CONSIDERATION OF IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

(“SBREFA”), the Commission and the Corporation request comment on the potential effect of
the proposed rule on the United States economy on an annual basis. The Commission and the
Corporation also request comment on any potential increases in costs or prices for consumers or
individual industries, and any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation based on
the proposed rule. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support
for their views to the extent possible.

liquidation of covered broker-dealers.

(a) The Corporation, as receiver for one or more covered brokers or dealers or in anticipation of

more bridge brokers or dealers with respect to a covered broker or dealer.
(b) If the Corporation establishes one or more bridge brokers or dealers with respect to a covered
broker or dealer, then, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the Corporation as receiver for
such covered broker or dealer shall transfer all customer accounts and all associated customer
name securities and customer property to such bridge brokers or dealers unless the
Corporation determines, after consultation with the Commission and SIPC, that:
(1) The customer accounts, customer name securities, and customer property are likely to be
promptly transferred to one or more qualified brokers or dealers such that the use of a
bridge broker or dealer would not facilitate such transfer to one or more qualified brokers
or dealers; or
(2) The transfer of such customer accounts to a bridge broker or dealer would materially
interfere with the ability of the Corporation to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on
financial stability or economic conditions in the United States.
(c) The Corporation, as receiver for such covered broker or dealer, also may transfer any other assets and
70

liabilities of the covered broker or dealer (including non-customer accounts and any associated
property and any assets and liabilities associated with any trust or custody business) to such bridge
brokers or dealers as the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine to be appropriate in accordance
with, and subject to the requirements of, 12 U.S.C. 5390(h), including 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(1) and
5390(h)(5), and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

(d) In connection with customer accounts transferred to the bridge broker or dealer pursuant to

with the covered broker or dealer. Customer property transferred from the covered broker or
dealer, along with advances from SIPC, shall be allocated to customer accounts at the bridge
broker or dealer in accordance with § 380.64(a)(3). Such allocations initially may be based
upon estimates, and such estimates may be based upon the books and records of the covered
broker or dealer or any other information deemed relevant in the discretion of the
Corporation as receiver, in consultation with SIPC, as trustee. Such estimates may be
adjusted from time to time as additional information becomes available. With respect to each
account transferred to the bridge broker or dealer pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this
section, the bridge broker or dealer shall undertake the obligations of a broker or dealer only
with respect to property transferred to and held by the bridge broker or dealer, and allocated
to the account as provided in §380.64(a)(3), including any customer property and any
advances from SIPC. The bridge broker or dealer shall have no obligations with respect to
any customer property or other property that is not transferred from the covered broker or
dealer to the bridge broker or dealer. The transfer of customer property to such an account
shall have no effect on calculation of the amount of the affected account holder’s net equity,
71

but the value, as of the appointment date, of the customer property and advances from SIPC
so transferred shall be deemed to satisfy any such claim, in whole or in part.
(e) The transfer of assets or liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer, including customer
accounts and all associated customer name securities and customer property, assets and
liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer for any non-customer creditor, and assets and
liabilities associated with any trust or custody business, to a bridge broker or dealer, shall be
effective without any consent, authorization, or approval of any person or entity, including
but not limited to, any customer, contract party, governmental authority, or court.
(f) Any succession to or assumption by a bridge broker or dealer of rights, powers, authorities,
or privileges of a covered broker or dealer shall be effective without any consent,
authorization, or approval of any person or entity, including but not limited to, any customer,
contract party, governmental authority, or court, and any such bridge broker or dealer shall
upon its organization by the Corporation immediately and by operation of law—
(1) Be established and deemed registered with the Commission under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934;
(2) Be deemed to be a member of SIPC; and
(3) Succeed to any and all registrations and memberships of the covered broker or dealer
with or in any self-regulatory organizations.
(g) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the bridge broker or dealer shall be
subject to applicable Federal securities laws and all requirements with respect to being a
member of a self-regulatory organization and shall operate in accordance with all such laws
and requirements and in accordance with its articles of association; provided, however, that
72

the Commission may, in its discretion, exempt the bridge broker or dealer from any such
requirements if the Commission deems such exemption to be necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors.
(h) At the end of the term of existence of a bridge broker or dealer, any proceeds that remain
after payment of all administrative expenses of such bridge broker or dealer and all other
claims against such bridge broker or dealer shall be distributed to the receiver for the related
covered broker or dealer.

§ 380.64 Claims of customers and other creditors of a covered broker or dealer.
(a) Trustee’s role. (1)SIPC, as trustee for a covered broker or dealer, shall determine customer
status, claims for net equity, claims for customer name securities, and whether property of
the covered broker or dealer qualifies as customer property. SIPC, as trustee for a covered
broker or dealer, shall make claims determinations in accordance with SIPA and with
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, but such determinations, and any claims related thereto, shall
be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) SIPC shall make advances in accordance with, and subject to the limitations imposed by,
15 U.S.C. 78fff-3. Where appropriate, SIPC shall make such advances by delivering cash
or securities to the customer accounts established at the bridge broker or dealer.
(3) Customer property held by a covered broker or dealer shall be allocated as follows:
(i) First, to SIPC in repayment of advances made by SIPC pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5385(f) and
15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(c)(1), to the extent such advances effected the release of securities
which then were apportioned to customer property pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff(d);
73

(ii) Second, to customers of such covered broker or dealer, or in the case that customer
accounts are transferred to a bridge broker or dealer, then to such customer accounts at a
bridge broker or dealer, who shall share ratably in such customer property on the basis
and to the extent of their respective net equities;
(iii) Third, to SIPC as subrogee for the claims of customers; and
(iv) Fourth, to SIPC in repayment of advances made by SIPC pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff3(c)(2).
(4) The determinations and advances made by SIPC as trustee for a covered broker or dealer
under this subpart D shall be made in a manner consistent with SIPC’s customary
practices under SIPA. The allocation of customer property, advances from SIPC, and
delivery of customer name securities to each customer or to its customer account at a
bridge broker or dealer, in partial or complete satisfaction of such customer’s net equity
claims as of the close of business on the appointment date, shall be in a manner, including
form and timing, and in an amount at least as beneficial to such customer as would have
been the case had the covered broker or dealer been liquidated under SIPA. Any claims
related to determinations made by SIPC as trustee for a covered broker or dealer shall be
governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) Receiver’s role. Any claim shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth
in 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2) through (5) and the regulations promulgated by the Corporation
thereunder, provided however, that—
(1) Notice requirements. The notice of the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for a
covered broker or dealer shall also include notice of the appointment of SIPC as trustee.
74

The Corporation as receiver shall coordinate with SIPC as trustee to post the notice on
SIPC’s public Web site in addition to the publication procedures set forth in § 380.33.
(2) Procedures for filing a claim. The Corporation as receiver shall consult with SIPC, as
trustee, regarding a claim form and filing instructions with respect to claims against the
Corporation as receiver for a covered broker or dealer, and such information shall be
provided on SIPC’s public Web site in addition to the Corporation’s public Web site.
Any such claim form shall contain a provision permitting a claimant to claim status as a
customer of the broker or dealer, if applicable.
(3) Claims bar date. The Corporation as receiver shall establish a claims bar date in
accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)(B)(i) and any regulations promulgated thereunder
by which date creditors of a covered broker or dealer, including all customers of the
covered broker or dealer, shall present their claims, together with proof. The claims bar
date for a covered broker or dealer shall be the date following the expiration of the sixmonth period beginning on the date a notice to creditors to file their claims is first
published in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)(B)(i) and any regulations
promulgated thereunder. Any claim filed after the claims bar date shall be disallowed,
and such disallowance shall be final, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(i) and any
regulations promulgated thereunder, except that a claim filed after the claims bar date
shall be considered by the receiver as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(ii) and any
regulations promulgated thereunder. In accordance with section 8(a)(3) of SIPA, 15
U.S.C. 78fff-2(a)(3), any claim for net equity filed more than sixty days after the date the
notice to creditors to file claims is first published need not be paid or satisfied in whole or
75

in part out of customer property and, to the extent such claim is paid by funds advanced
by SIPC, it shall be satisfied in cash or securities, or both, as SIPC, as trustee, determines
is most economical to the receivership estate.
(c) Decision period. The Corporation as receiver of a covered broker or dealer shall notify a
claimant whether it allows or disallows the claim, or any portion of a claim or any claim of a
security, preference, set-off, or priority, within the 180-day period set forth in 12 U.S.C.
5390(a)(3)(A) and any regulations promulgated thereunder (as such 180-day period may be
extended by written agreement as provided therein) or within the 90-day period set forth in
12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(5)(B) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, whichever is
applicable. In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Corporation, as receiver,
shall issue the notice required by this paragraph (c), which shall utilize the determination
made by SIPC, as trustee, in a manner consistent with SIPC’s customary practices in a
liquidation under SIPA, with respect to any claim for net equity or customer name securities.
The process established herein for the determination, within the 180-day period set forth in
12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(A) and any regulations promulgated thereunder (as such 180-day
period may be extended by written agreement as provided therein), of claims by customers of
a covered broker or dealer for customer property or customer name securities shall constitute
the exclusive process for the determination of such claims, and any procedure for expedited
relief established pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(5) and any regulations promulgated
thereunder shall be inapplicable to such claims.
(d) Judicial review. The claimant may seek a judicial determination of any claim disallowed, in
whole or in part, by the Corporation as receiver, including any claim disallowed based upon
76

any determination(s) of SIPC as trustee made pursuant to § 380.64(a), by the appropriate
district or territorial court of the United States in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(4) or
(5), whichever is applicable, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

§ 380.65 Priorities for unsecured claims against a covered broker or dealer.
Allowed claims not satisfied pursuant to § 380.63(d), including allowed claims for net
equity to the extent not satisfied after final allocation of customer property in accordance with §
380.64(a)(3), shall be paid in accordance with the order of priority set forth in § 380.21 subject to
the following adjustments:
(a) Administrative expenses of SIPC incurred in performing its responsibilities as trustee for a
covered broker or dealer shall be included as administrative expenses of the receiver as
defined in § 380.22 and shall be paid pro rata with such expenses in accordance with §
380.21(c).
(b) Amounts paid by the Corporation to customers or SIPC shall be included as amounts owed to
the United States as defined in § 380.23 and shall be paid pro rata with such amounts in
accordance with § 380.21(c).
(c) Amounts advanced by SIPC for the purpose of satisfying customer claims for net equity shall
be paid following the payment of all amounts owed to the United States pursuant to §
380.21(a)(3) but prior to the payment of any other class or priority of claims described in §
380.21(a)(4) through (11).

§ 380.66 Administrative expenses of SIPC.
77

(a) In carrying out its responsibilities, SIPC, as trustee for a covered broker or dealer, may utilize
the services of third parties, including private attorneys, accountants, consultants, advisors,
outside experts, and other third party professionals. SIPC shall have an allowed claim for
administrative expenses for any amounts paid by SIPC for such services to the extent that
such services are available in the private sector, and utilization of such services is practicable,
efficient, and cost effective. The term administrative expenses of SIPC includes the costs and
expenses of such attorneys, accountants, consultants, advisors, outside experts, and other
third party professionals, and other expenses that would be allowable to a third party trustee
under 15 U.S.C. 78eee(b)(5)(A), including the costs and expenses of SIPC employees that
would be allowable pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff(e).
(b) The term administrative expenses of SIPC shall not include advances from SIPC to satisfy
customer claims for net equity.

§ 380.67 Qualified financial contracts.
The rights and obligations of any party to a qualified financial contract to which a
covered broker or dealer is a party shall be governed exclusively by 12 U.S.C. 5390, including
the limitations and restrictions contained in 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(10)(B), and any regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(i) Any existing case or proceeding with respect to a covered broker or dealer under the
Bankruptcy Code or SIPA shall be dismissed effective as of the appointment date and no
such case or proceeding may be commenced with respect to a covered broker or dealer at
any time while the Corporation is receiver for such covered broker or dealer;
(ii) The revesting of assets in a covered broker or dealer to the extent that they have
vested in any entity other than the covered broker or dealer as a result of any case or
proceeding commenced with respect to the covered broker or dealer under the
Bankruptcy Code, SIPA, or any similar provision of State liquidation or insolvency law
applicable to the covered broker or dealer; provided that any such revesting shall not
apply to assets held by the covered broker or dealer, including customer property,
transferred prior to the appointment date pursuant to an order entered by the bankruptcy
court presiding over the case or proceeding with respect to the covered broker or dealer;
(iii) The request of the Corporation as receiver for a stay in any judicial action or
proceeding (other than actions dismissed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this
section) in which the covered broker or dealer is or becomes a party for a period of up to
90 days from the appointment date;
(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(v) of this section with respect to qualified
financial contracts, no person may exercise any right or power to terminate, accelerate or
82

declare a default under any contract to which the covered broker or dealer is a party (and
no provision in any such contract providing for such default, termination or acceleration
shall be enforceable), or to obtain possession of or exercise control over any property of
the covered broker or dealer or affect any contractual rights of the covered broker or
dealer without the consent of the Corporation as receiver of the covered broker or dealer
upon consultation with SIPC during the 90-day period beginning from the appointment
date; and
(v) The exercise of rights and the performance of obligations by parties to qualified
financial contracts with the covered broker or dealer may be affected, stayed, or delayed
pursuant to the provisions of Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (including 12 U.S.C.
5390(c)) and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

§ 302.103 Bridge broker or dealer.
(a) The Corporation, as receiver for one or more covered brokers or dealers or in anticipation of
being appointed receiver for one or more covered broker or dealers, may organize one or
more bridge brokers or dealers with respect to a covered broker or dealer.
(b) If the Corporation establishes one or more bridge brokers or dealers with respect to a covered
broker or dealer, then, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the Corporation as receiver for
such covered broker or dealer shall transfer all customer accounts and all associated customer
name securities and customer property to such bridge brokers or dealers unless the
Corporation determines, after consultation with the Commission and SIPC, that:
(1) The customer accounts, customer name securities, and customer property are likely to be
83

promptly transferred to one or more qualified brokers or dealers such that the use of a
bridge broker or dealer would not facilitate such transfer to one or more qualified brokers
or dealers; or
(2) The transfer of such customer accounts to a bridge broker or dealer would materially
interfere with the ability of the Corporation to avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on
financial stability or economic conditions in the United States.
(c) The Corporation, as receiver for such covered broker or dealer, also may transfer any other
assets and liabilities of the covered broker or dealer (including non-customer accounts and
any associated property and any assets and liabilities associated with any trust or custody
business) to such bridge brokers or dealers as the Corporation may, in its discretion,
determine to be appropriate in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, 12 U.S.C.
5390(h), including 12 U.S.C. 5390(h)(1) and 5390(h)(5), and any regulations promulgated
thereunder.
(d) In connection with customer accounts transferred to the bridge broker or dealer pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this section, claims for net equity shall not be transferred but shall remain
with the covered broker or dealer. Customer property transferred from the covered broker or
dealer, along with advances from SIPC, shall be allocated to customer accounts at the bridge
broker or dealer in accordance with § 302.104(a)(3). Such allocations initially may be based
upon estimates, and such estimates may be based upon the books and records of the covered
broker or dealer or any other information deemed relevant in the discretion of the
Corporation as receiver, in consultation with SIPC, as trustee. Such estimates may be
adjusted from time to time as additional information becomes available. With respect to each
84

account transferred to the bridge broker or dealer pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this
section, the bridge broker or dealer shall undertake the obligations of a broker or dealer only
with respect to property transferred to and held by the bridge broker or dealer, and allocated
to the account as provided in § 302.104(a)(3), including any customer property and any
advances from SIPC. The bridge broker or dealer shall have no obligations with respect to
any customer property or other property that is not transferred from the covered broker or
dealer to the bridge broker or dealer. The transfer of customer property to such an account
shall have no effect on calculation of the amount of the affected accountholder’s net equity,
but the value, as of the appointment date, of the customer property and advances from SIPC
so transferred shall be deemed to satisfy any such claim, in whole or in part.
(e) The transfer of assets or liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer, including customer
accounts and all associated customer name securities and customer property, assets and
liabilities held by a covered broker or dealer for any non-customer creditor, and assets and
liabilities associated with any trust or custody business, to a bridge broker or dealer, shall be
effective without any consent, authorization, or approval of any person or entity, including
but not limited to, any customer, contract party, governmental authority, or court.
(f) Any succession to or assumption by a bridge broker or dealer of rights, powers, authorities,
or privileges of a covered broker or dealer shall be effective without any consent,
authorization, or approval of any person or entity, including but not limited to, any customer,
contract party, governmental authority, or court, and any such bridge broker or dealer shall
upon its organization by the Corporation immediately and by operation of law—
(1) Be established and deemed registered with the Commission under the Securities
85

Exchange Act of 1934;
(2) Be deemed to be a member of SIPC; and
(3) Succeed to any and all registrations and memberships of the covered broker or dealer
with or in any self-regulatory organizations.
(g) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the bridge broker or dealer shall be
subject to applicable Federal securities laws and all requirements with respect to being a
member of a self-regulatory organization and shall operate in accordance with all such laws
and requirements and in accordance with its articles of association; provided, however, that
the Commission may, in its discretion, exempt the bridge broker or dealer from any such
requirements if the Commission deems such exemption to be necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors.
(h) At the end of the term of existence of a bridge broker or dealer, any proceeds that remain
after payment of all administrative expenses of such bridge broker or dealer and all other
claims against such bridge broker or dealer shall be distributed to the receiver for the related
covered broker or dealer.

§ 302.104 Claims of customers and other creditors of a covered broker or dealer.
(a) Trustee’s role. (1)SIPC, as trustee for a covered broker or dealer, shall determine customer
status, claims for net equity, claims for customer name securities, and whether property of
the covered broker or dealer qualifies as customer property. SIPC, as trustee for a covered
broker or dealer, shall make claims determinations in accordance with SIPA and with
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, but such determinations, and any claims related thereto, shall
86

be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) SIPC shall make advances in accordance with, and subject to the limitations imposed by,
15 U.S.C. 78fff-3. Where appropriate, SIPC shall make such advances by delivering cash
or securities to the customer accounts established at the bridge broker or dealer.
(3) Customer property held by a covered broker or dealer shall be allocated as follows:
(i) First, to SIPC in repayment of advances made by SIPC pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5385(f) and
15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(c)(1), to the extent such advances effected the release of securities
which then were apportioned to customer property pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff(d);
(ii) Second, to customers of such covered broker or dealer, or in the case that customer
accounts are transferred to a bridge broker or dealer, then to such customer accounts at a
bridge broker or dealer, who shall share ratably in such customer property on the basis
and to the extent of their respective net equities;
(iii) Third, to SIPC as subrogee for the claims of customers; and
(iv) Fourth, to SIPC in repayment of advances made by SIPC pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff3(c)(2).
(4) The determinations and advances made by SIPC as trustee for a covered broker or dealer
under §§ 302.100 through 302.107 shall be made in a manner consistent with SIPC’s
customary practices under SIPA. The allocation of customer property, advances from
SIPC, and delivery of customer name securities to each customer or to its customer
account at a bridge broker or dealer, in partial or complete satisfaction of such customer’s
net equity claims as of the close of business on the appointment date, shall be in a
manner, including form and timing, and in an amount at least as beneficial to such
87

customer as would have been the case had the covered broker or dealer been liquidated
under SIPA. Any claims related to determinations made by SIPC as trustee for a covered
broker or dealer shall be governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this
section.
(b) Receiver’s role. Any claim shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth
in 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2) through (5) and the regulations promulgated by the Corporation
thereunder, provided however, that—
(1) Notice requirements. The notice of the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for a
covered broker or dealer shall also include notice of the appointment of SIPC as trustee.
The Corporation as receiver shall coordinate with SIPC as trustee to post the notice on
SIPC’s public Web site in addition to the publication procedures set forth in 12 CFR
380.33.
(2) Procedures for filing a claim. The Corporation as receiver shall consult with SIPC, as
trustee, regarding a claim form and filing instructions with respect to claims against the
Corporation as receiver for a covered broker or dealer, and such information shall be
provided on SIPC’s public Web site in addition to the Corporation’s public Web site.
Any such claim form shall contain a provision permitting a claimant to claim status as a
customer of the broker or dealer, if applicable.
(3) Claims bar date. The Corporation as receiver shall establish a claims bar date in
accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)(B)(i) and any regulations promulgated thereunder
by which date creditors of a covered broker or dealer, including all customers of the
covered broker or dealer, shall present their claims, together with proof. The claims bar
88

date for a covered broker or dealer shall be the date following the expiration of the sixmonth period beginning on the date a notice to creditors to file their claims is first
published in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(2)(B)(i) and any regulations
promulgated thereunder. Any claim filed after the claims bar date shall be disallowed,
and such disallowance shall be final, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(i) and any
regulations promulgated thereunder, except that a claim filed after the claims bar date
shall be considered by the receiver as provided by 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(C)(ii) and any
regulations promulgated thereunder. In accordance with section 8(a)(3) of SIPA, 15
U.S.C. 78fff-2(a)(3), any claim for net equity filed more than sixty days after the date the
notice to creditors to file claims is first published need not be paid or satisfied in whole or
in part out of customer property and, to the extent such claim is paid by funds advanced
by SIPC, it shall be satisfied in cash or securities, or both, as SIPC, as trustee, determines
is most economical to the receivership estate.
(c) Decision period. The Corporation as receiver of a covered broker or dealer shall notify a
claimant whether it allows or disallows the claim, or any portion of a claim or any claim of a
security, preference, set-off, or priority, within the 180-day period set forth in 12 U.S.C.
5390(a)(3)(A) and any regulations promulgated thereunder (as such 180-day period may be
extended by written agreement as provided therein) or within the 90-day period set forth in
12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(5)(B) and any regulations promulgated thereunder, whichever is
applicable. In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Corporation, as receiver,
shall issue the notice required by this paragraph (c), which shall utilize the determination
made by SIPC, as trustee, in a manner consistent with SIPC’s customary practices in a
89

liquidation under SIPA, with respect to any claim for net equity or customer name securities.
The process established herein for the determination, within the 180-day period set forth in
12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(3)(A) and any regulations promulgated thereunder (as such 180-day
period may be extended by written agreement as provided therein), of claims by customers of
a covered broker or dealer for customer property or customer name securities shall constitute
the exclusive process for the determination of such claims, and any procedure for expedited
relief established pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(5) and any regulations promulgated
thereunder shall be inapplicable to such claims.
(d) Judicial review. The claimant may seek a judicial determination of any claim disallowed, in
whole or in part, by the Corporation as receiver, including any claim disallowed based upon
any determination(s) of SIPC as trustee made pursuant to § 302.104(a), by the appropriate
district or territorial court of the United States in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(4) or
(5), whichever is applicable, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

§ 302.105 Priorities for unsecured claims against a covered broker or dealer.
Allowed claims not satisfied pursuant to § 302.103(d), including allowed claims for net
equity to the extent not satisfied after final allocation of customer property in accordance with §
302.104(a)(3), shall be paid in accordance with the order of priority set forth in 12 CFR 380.21
subject to the following adjustments:
(a) Administrative expenses of SIPC incurred in performing its responsibilities as trustee for a
covered broker or dealer shall be included as administrative expenses of the receiver as
defined in 12 CFR 380.22 and shall be paid pro rata with such expenses in accordance with
90

12 CFR 380.21(c).
(b) Amounts paid by the Corporation to customers or SIPC shall be included as amounts owed to
the United States as defined in 12 CFR 380.23 and shall be paid pro rata with such amounts
in accordance with 12 CFR 380.21(c).
(c) Amounts advanced by SIPC for the purpose of satisfying customer claims for net equity shall
be paid following the payment of all amounts owed to the United States pursuant to 12 CFR
380.21(a)(3) but prior to the payment of any other class or priority of claims described in 12
CFR 380.21(a)(4) through (11).

§ 302.106 Administrative expenses of SIPC.
(a) In carrying out its responsibilities, SIPC, as trustee for a covered broker or dealer, may utilize
the services of third parties, including private attorneys, accountants, consultants, advisors,
outside experts, and other third party professionals. SIPC shall have an allowed claim for
administrative expenses for any amounts paid by SIPC for such services to the extent that
such services are available in the private sector, and utilization of such services is practicable,
efficient, and cost effective. The term administrative expenses of SIPC includes the costs and
expenses of such attorneys, accountants, consultants, advisors, outside experts, and other
third party professionals, and other expenses that would be allowable to a third party trustee
under 15 U.S.C. 78eee(b)(5)(A), including the costs and expenses of SIPC employees that
would be allowable pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 78fff(e).
(b) The term administrative expenses of SIPC shall not include advances from SIPC to satisfy
customer claims for net equity.
91

§ 302.107 Qualified financial contracts.
The rights and obligations of any party to a qualified financial contract to which a
covered broker or dealer is a party shall be governed exclusively by 12 U.S.C. 5390, including
the limitations and restrictions contained in 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(10)(B), and any regulations
promulgated thereunder.
