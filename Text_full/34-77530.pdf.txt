ORDER DETERMINING WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD CLAIM
On September 30, 2015, the Claims Review Staff (“CRS”) issued a Preliminary
Determination related to Notice of Covered Action Redacted The Preliminary Determination
Redacted
recommended that
Claimant 1
(“Claimant 1”) receive an award of
percent
Redacted of the monetary sanctions collected
Redacted
Redacted
(“Covered Action”) and Redacted
percent Redacted of the
Redacted
monetary sanctions collected in a related criminal action,
Redacted
(“Related Criminal Action”). The Preliminary Determination also recommended that
the award application submitted by Claimant 2 (“Claimant 2”) be denied. Only Claimant 2
contested the Preliminary Determination.
For the reasons stated below, we adopt the recommendations in the Preliminary

Claimant 1’s Claim is Approved

Upon due consideration of the administrative record, it is hereby ORDERED that for the
Redacted
percent
reasons set forth in the Preliminary Determination Claimant 1 shall receive
Redacted of the monetary sanctions collected in the Covered Action and
Redacted
percent Redacted
of the monetary sanctions collected in the Related Criminal Action. Claimant 1’s award will
total more than $275,000 based on the monetary sanctions collected in the Covered Action and
the Related Criminal Action thus far and shall be offset as described more fully below.1
Claimant 1’s award shall be subject to an offset for any monetary obligations (including
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalty amounts) that, as of the date of this order,
Redacted
remain unpaid from the Final Judgment entered against Claimant 1 in
Redacted
Redacted
(estimated to be
as
of this date). Claimant 1 was advised of the potential offset in the Preliminary Determination and
did not file an objection. Accordingly, Claimant 1 is deemed to have consented to the offset and
to have waived any opposition.

Claimant 2’s Claim Is Denied
A. Preliminary Determination and Claimant’s Response

1

Monetary sanctions collected by the Commission in the Covered Action or by the

Redacted
in the
Related Criminal Action that are either deemed to satisfy or are in fact used to satisfy any payment obligations of the
defendants in the other action shall not be double counted for purposes of paying an award; further, for purposes of
calculating an award payment, any monetary sanctions collected in the manner just described shall be attributed, first,
to the Commission's Covered Action up to the full amount of monetary sanctions ordered in the Covered Action, with
any remaining amounts attributed to the Related Criminal Action.

In its Preliminary Determination, the CRS recommended that Claimant 2’s award
application be denied because the record demonstrated that Claimant 2 did not provide any
information that led to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action. See Section 21F(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 21F-3(a) thereunder, 17
C.F.R. § 240.21F-3(a). Claimant 2 timely submitted a response contesting the Preliminary
Determination (hereinafter, “Response”).
To qualify for an award under Section 21F of the Exchange Act, a whistleblower must
voluntarily provide the Commission with original information that leads to the successful
enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action or related action. 15 U.S.C. § 78u6(b)(1). As relevant here, original information “leads to” a successful enforcement action if
either: (i) the original information caused the staff to open an investigation, reopen an
investigation, or inquire into different conduct as part of a current investigation, and the
Commission brought a successful action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the
subject of the original information; or (ii) the conduct was already under examination or
investigation, and the original information significantly contributed to the success of the action.
Rule 21F-4(c)(1)-(2), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-4(c)(1)-(2).
Based on our review of the record, we find that none of the information Claimant 2
submitted led to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action. First, none of the tips
identified by Claimant 2 in Claimant 2’s award application was provided to the staff responsible
for the Covered Action. The record conclusively demonstrates that each of the tips was
designated for “no further action” by the Commission’s Office of Market Intelligence – the
Commission office that is responsible for the initial intake review of whistleblower tips – and
were not provided to investigative staff for further inquiry or for use in connection with any
Commission investigation. Second, the record demonstrates that at no point prior to the
settlement of the Covered Action did the staff members responsible for the Covered Action have
any contact with, or receive any information from, Claimant 2.
Because the record demonstrates that Claimant 2’s information did not lead to the
successful enforcement of the Covered Action and Claimant 2 has not shown otherwise in
Claimant 2’s request for reconsideration of the Preliminary Determination, we deny Claimant 2’s
application for an award.2

In the Response, Claimant 2 challenges OWB’s decision not to provide Claimant 2 with the record materials
underlying the Preliminary Determination. Under Exchange Act Rules 21F-8(b)(4) and 12(b), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F8(b)(4) and 12(b), claimants requesting the administrative record in order to challenge a preliminary determination
may be required by OWB to sign a confidentiality agreement in a form acceptable to OWB as a prerequisite to
receiving a copy of the record. In accordance with these rules, it is standard practice of OWB to require all

Conclusion

Redacted
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Claimant 1 shall receive an award of
percent Redacted of the monetary sanctions collected in the Covered Action and an award of
Redacted
percent Redacted of the monetary sanctions collected in the Related Criminal Action
subject to an offset as described above for any monetary obligations that remain unpaid from the
Final Judgment entered against Claimant 1. It is further ORDERED that Claimant 2’s
whistleblower award claim is denied.

claimants seeking copies of the record to sign a confidentiality agreement in order to prevent the disclosure of nonpublic information. Claimant 2 failed to sign the confidentiality agreement within the deadline set by OWB.
Several weeks after that deadline, Claimant 2 returned a signed copy of a substantially modified version of the
confidentiality agreement that included various material, objectionable provisions, including a provision that would
have required the Commission to provide Claimant 2 with counsel and to pay for Claimant 2’s legal costs and
expenses in connection with Claimant 2’s challenge of the Preliminary Determination. We find that given these
objectionable modifications, OWB appropriately declined to counter-sign the confidentiality agreement, and, in
accordance with Rules 21F-8(b)(4) and 12(b), OWB appropriately declined to provide Claimant 2 with the record.
