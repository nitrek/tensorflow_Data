ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on March 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated the
antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral
loan obligation funds (known as the Zohar Funds) by reporting misleading values for the assets held
by the funds and failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s undisclosed
approach to categorization of assets. The proceeding was stayed by order of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit between September 17, 2015, and June 2016. See Tilton v. SEC,
No. 15-2103, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 9970, at *37 (2d Cir. June 1, 2016); Tilton v. SEC, No. 152103, ECF Nos. 76, 125. The hearing is currently scheduled to commence on October 24, 2016.
The prehearing schedule includes the deadlines of August 22, 2016, for exchange of
amended witness and exhibit lists, and September 12, 2016, for motions in limine. Lynn Tilton,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release Nos. 4004, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2499 (A.L.J. July 20, 2016); 4046,
2016 SEC LEXIS 2699 (A.L.J. Aug. 5, 2016). Respondents filed, in compliance with the schedule,
several motions in limine that sought to exclude various categories of potential evidence from the
record. Lynn Tilton, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4245, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3848 (A.L.J. Oct.
12, 2016). Additional, pending, motions were filed by Respondents and the Division of
Enforcement since September 12. “[T]o secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination” of
this proceeding, no additional motions seeking to preclude or exclude documentary evidence or
testimony will be considered after October 17, 2016.1 See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.103(a), .111(d). If a
party wishes to file any other type of motion, it should, briefly, request leave to do so.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

A party that wishes to object to testimony or the introduction of a specific exhibit during the
hearing should do so orally, briefly. The objection, whether sustained or overruled, will thus be
preserved for appeal on the record.
