INTRODUCTION
A.

BACKGROUND

The Dodd-Frank Act, 1 through Title IX, Subtitle C, “Improvements to the Regulation of
Credit Rating Agencies,” among other things, establishes new self-executing requirements
applicable to NRSROs and requires that the Commission adopt rules applicable to NRSROs in a
number of areas. 2 It also requires certain studies relating to NRSROs. 3 The NRSRO provisions

1

Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, H.R. 4173 (July 21, 2010).

2

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 931 through 939H. In addition, Title IX, Subtitle D, “Improvements to the AssetBacked Securitization Process,” contains section 943, which provides that the Commission shall adopt
rules, within 180 days, requiring an NRSRO to include in any report accompanying a credit rating of an
asset-backed security a description of the representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms
available to investors and how they differ from the representations, warranties, and enforcement
mechanisms in issuances of similar securities. See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 943. On January 20, 2011, the
Commission adopted Rule 17g-7 to implement section 943. See Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities
Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Securities
Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) Release No. 9175 (Jan. 20, 2011), 76 FR 4489 (Jan. 26, 2011). Prior to
enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the adoption of Rule 17g-7, the Commission proposed a different
rule to be codified at 17 CFR 240.17g-7. See Proposed Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) Release No. 57967 (June 16, 2008), 73
FR 36212 (June 25, 2008). This proposed rule would have required an NRSRO to publish a report
containing certain information with the publication of a credit rating for a structured finance product or, as
an alternative, use ratings symbols for structured finance products that differentiate them from the credit
ratings for other types of debt securities. See id. In November 2009, the Commission announced it was
deferring consideration of action on that proposal and separately proposed a different rule to be codified at
17 CFR 240.17g-7 that would have required an NRSRO to annually disclose certain information. See
Proposed Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No.
61051 (Nov. 23, 2009), 74 FR 63866 (Dec. 4, 2009). As discussed above, a different rule from either of

6

in the Dodd-Frank Act augment the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Rating
Agency Act of 2006”), which established a registration and oversight program for NRSROs
through self-executing provisions added to the Exchange Act and implementing rules adopted by
the Commission under the Exchange Act, as amended by the Rating Agency Act of 2006. 4 Title
IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act also provides that the Commission shall prescribe the
format of a certification that providers of third-party due diligence services must provide to each
NRSRO producing a credit rating for an asset-backed security to which the due diligence

these proposals ultimately was adopted and codified at 17 CFR 240.17g-7 in January 2011. See Disclosure
for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, 76 FR 4489.

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 939(h), 939C, 939D, 939E, 939F. Pursuant to section 939(h) of the Dodd-Frank
Act, the Commission submitted a staff report to Congress on standardizing credit rating terminology. See
Report to Congress Credit Rating Standardization Study As Required by Section 939(h) of the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Sept. 2012), available at
http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2012/939h_credit_rating_standardization.pdf (“2012 Staff Report on
Credit Rating Standardization”). Pursuant to section 939F of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission
submitted a staff report to Congress on the feasibility of establishing a system for assigning NRSROs to
determine credit ratings for structured finance products. See Report to Congress on Assigned Credit
Ratings As Required by Section 939F of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(Dec. 2012), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2012/assigned-credit-ratings-study.pdf (“2012
Staff Report on Assigned Credit Ratings”). Pursuant to section 939C of the Dodd-Frank Act, the
Commission submitted a staff report to Congress on the independence of credit rating agencies. See Report
to Congress on Credit Rating Agency Independence Study As Required by Section 939C of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Nov. 2013), available at
http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2013/credit-rating-agency-independence-study-2013.pdf (“2013 Staff
Report on Credit Rating Agency Independence”).

See Pub. L. No. 109-291 (2006). The Rating Agency Act of 2006, among other things, amended section 3
of the Exchange Act to add definitions, added section 15E to the Exchange Act to establish self-executing
requirements for NRSROs and provide the Commission with the authority to implement a registration and
oversight program for NRSROs, amended section 17 of the Exchange Act to provide the Commission with
recordkeeping, reporting, and examination authority over NRSROs, and amended section 21B(a) of the
Exchange Act to provide the Commission with the authority to assess penalties “against any person” in
administrative proceedings instituted under section 15E of the Exchange Act. See Pub. L. No. 109-291, 3
and 4; 15 U.S.C. 78c; 15 U.S.C. 78o-7; 15 U.S.C. 78q; 15 U.S.C. 78u-2. The Commission adopted rules to
implement a registration and oversight program for NRSROs in June 2007. See Oversight of Credit Rating
Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No.
55857 (June 5, 2007), 72 FR 33564 (June 18, 2007). The implementing rules were Form NRSRO, Rule
17g-1, Rule 17g-2, Rule 17g-3, Rule 17g-4, Rule 17g-5, and Rule 17g-6. The Commission has twice
adopted amendments to some of these rules. See Amendments to Rules for Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No. 59342 (Feb. 2, 2009), 74 FR 6456 (Feb. 9,
2009); Amendments to Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act
Release No. 61050 (Nov. 23, 2009), 74 FR 63832 (Dec. 4, 2009).

services relate. 5 Finally, Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new
requirement for issuers and underwriters of asset-backed securities to make publicly available the
findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or
underwriter. 6
On May 18, 2011, the Commission proposed for comment amendments to existing rules
and new rules in accordance with Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act and to enhance
oversight of NRSROs. 7 The Commission received a number of comment letters in response to
the proposals. 8 The comments on specific proposals are summarized below in the corresponding

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 932(a)(8) (adding new paragraph (s)(4)(C) to section 15E of the Exchange Act);

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No. 64514 (May 18,

The Commission has performed an economic analysis in connection with today’s
adoption of the amendments and new rules discussed in section II. of this release. The economic
analysis is reflected in this section I.B. of the release as well as throughout the rest of the
release. 9

Guiding Principles

Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the Commission prescribe rules
to improve regulation of NRSROs. 10 Section 931 of the Dodd-Frank Act, “Findings,” introduces
Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act and provides context to what motivated Congress to
enact these provisions with respect to NRSROs. 11 In particular, Congress found:
•

Because of the systemic importance of credit ratings and the reliance placed on credit
ratings by individual and institutional investors and financial regulators, the activities and
performances of credit rating agencies, including NRSROs, are matters of national public
interest, as credit rating agencies are central to capital formation, investor confidence, and
the efficient performance of the U.S. economy. 12

•

Credit rating agencies, including NRSROs, play a critical ‘‘gatekeeper’’ role in the debt
market that is functionally similar to that of securities analysts, who evaluate the quality
of securities in the equity market, and auditors, who review the financial statements of
firms. Such role justifies a similar level of public oversight and accountability. 13

•

Because credit rating agencies perform evaluative and analytical services on behalf of
clients, much as other financial ‘‘gatekeepers’’ do, the activities of credit rating agencies
are fundamentally commercial in character and should be subject to the same standards of
liability and oversight as apply to auditors, securities analysts, and investment bankers. 14

The discussion of the amendments and new rules in section II of this release is organized into sections that
in large part are based on the distinct rulemaking mandates in Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act.
See sections II.A. through II.M. of this release. Each section includes an economic analysis that focuses
specifically on the amendments or rules being discussed in the section.

In certain activities, particularly in advising arrangers of structured financial products on
potential ratings of such products, credit rating agencies face conflicts of interest that
need to be carefully monitored and that therefore should be addressed explicitly in
legislation in order to give clearer authority to the Commission.15

•

In the recent financial crisis, the ratings on structured financial products have proven to
be inaccurate. This inaccuracy contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks
by financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the health of the
economy in the United States and around the world. Such inaccuracy necessitates
increased accountability on the part of credit rating agencies. 16
The amendments and new rules being adopted today to implement sections 932, 936, and

938 of the Dodd-Frank Act are designed to address these findings of Congress. For example,
they are intended to increase the integrity and transparency of credit ratings and promote public
oversight and accountability of NRSROs as “gatekeepers” for the primary benefit of the users of
credit ratings. 17 The amendments and new rules also prescribe new disclosure requirements
relating to structured finance products and, in particular, asset-backed securities. 18 These
requirements are designed to address concerns about the role of NRSROs in the financial crisis
of 2007−2009 19 in terms of how they rated certain types of structured finance products and, in
particular, the inherent conflicts of interest in rating these products. 20

The term structured finance product as used throughout this release refers broadly to any security or money
market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities
transaction. This broad category of financial instrument includes an asset-backed security as defined in
section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(79)) and other types of structured debt instruments,
including synthetic and hybrid collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”). The term Exchange Act-ABS as
used throughout this release refers more narrowly to an asset-backed security as defined in section 3(a)(79)
of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(79).

In the market for structured finance products, the pool of assets underlying or referenced
by the product is often comprised of hundreds of thousands of loans, each requiring time and
expense to evaluate. In these markets, the separation between the borrower and the ultimate
provider of credit can introduce significant information asymmetries between the parties
involved in the securitization process that creates a structured finance product 21 and investors in
the product, who may have less information on the credit quality and other relevant
characteristics of the asset pool. 22 Further, disclosures to investors regarding the asset pool may
not be sufficiently detailed to allow investors to adequately evaluate the quality of the collateral
backing the securities and, thereby, assess the credit risk of the securities. Consequently, the
market for structured finance products has evolved as a “rated” market in which the credit risk of
the products is assessed by credit rating agencies 23 and the valuations of the products depend
significantly on credit ratings. 24 To curb their informational disadvantage, certain investors in
structured finance products may use credit ratings to inform their investment decisions. 25

interests facing credit rating agencies, and inaccuracies in ratings on structured finance products).

Asset-backed securitization – the process used to create asset-backed securities – is a financing technique in
which financial assets are pooled and converted into instruments that may be offered and sold in the capital
markets. In a basic securitization structure, an entity – often a financial institution – originates or otherwise
acquires a pool of financial assets, such as mortgage loans, either directly or through an affiliate. It then
sells the financial assets, again either directly or through an affiliate, for the purpose of depositing them into
a specially created investment vehicle that issues securities “backed” by those financial assets. Payment on
the asset-backed securities depends primarily on the cash flows generated by the assets in the underlying
pool (and possibly other rights designed to assure timely payment, generally known as “credit
enhancements”). See Asset-Backed Securities, Securities Act Release No. 8518 (Dec. 22, 2004), 70 FR
1506 (Jan. 7, 2005).

Given that investors may not know the quality of the assets underlying structured finance
products, certain originators of these assets may attempt to adversely transfer risks of poor
origination decisions to investors by creating complex and opaque structured finance products. 26
This risk is especially pronounced when the originator, sponsor, depositor, or underwriter
receives compensation before investors learn about the quality of the assets. 27 Because
origination fees are based on transaction volume and risks are transferred to investors, an
2008: Causes, Consequences, and Implications for Reform (Edward Elgar Press 2010, Lawrence Mitchell
and Arthur Wilmarth, eds.). References to credit ratings in federal regulations also may have contributed to
investor reliance on credit ratings. Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act requires each federal agency,
including the Commission, to review any regulation issued by such agency that requires the use of an
assessment of the creditworthiness of a security or money market instruments and any references to or
requirements in such regulations regarding credit ratings. See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 939A. The section
further provides that each such agency shall “modify any such regulations identified by the review…to
remove any reference to or requirement of reliance on credit ratings, and to substitute in such regulations
such standard of creditworthiness as each respective agency shall determine as appropriate for such
regulations.” Id.

See Chris Downing, Dwight Jaffee, and Nancy Wallace, Is the Market for Mortgage-Backed Securities a
Market for Lemons?, 22(7) REV. FIN. STUD. 2457-2494 (2009). The authors argue that the quality of the
assets sold to investors through securitization is lower than the quality of similar assets that are not sold to
investors. They find empirical support for this proposition using a comprehensive dataset of sales of
mortgage-backed securities (Freddie Mac Participation Certificates) to special-purpose vehicles over the
period 1991 through 2002.

27

Several parties may be involved in the securitization process that creates an asset-backed security,
including an originator, sponsor, depositor, issuing entity, underwriter, and arranger. See generally AssetBacked Securities, 70 FR at 1508. The originator is the entity that creates a financial asset (for example,
mortgage loan, auto loan, or credit card receivable) that collateralizes an asset-backed security through an
extension of credit or otherwise and that sells the asset to be included in an asset-backed security. The
sponsor is the entity that organizes and initiates the asset-backed securities transaction by transferring the
financial assets underlying an asset-backed security directly or indirectly to the issuing entity. The
depositor is an entity that receives or purchases the financial assets from the sponsor and transfers them to
the issuing entity (in some cases the sponsor transfers the financial assets directly to the issuing entity,
thereby by-passing the use of a separate depositor). The issuing entity is the trust or other vehicle created
at the direction of the sponsor or depositor that owns or holds the financial assets and in whose name the
asset-backed securities are issued. The underwriter is the entity that underwrites the offering of assetbacked securities and sells them to investors. The arranger is an entity that organizes and arranges a
securitization transaction, but does not sell or transfer the assets to the issuing entity. It also structures the
transaction and may act as an underwriter for the deal. In jurisdictions where an arranger is used, the
arranger’s role is similar to that of a sponsor in other jurisdictions. In some cases, a single entity may
perform more than one function (for example, a financial institution may act as an originator and sponsor).
The issuer of a structured finance product as used in this release can mean, depending on the context, the
issuing entity or the person that organizes and initiates the offering of the structured finance product (for
example, the sponsor or depositor). Generally, when this release discusses an issuer taking a specific action
in the context of an offering of a structured finance product (for example, making a disclosure), the person
that organizes and initiates the offering would be the person taking the action (as opposed to the issuing
entity). Further, in the context of the discussion of Rules 17g-10 and 15Ga-2, the term issuer (which is
defined in Rule 17g-10) includes a sponsor or depositor.

13

originator may have the economic incentive to produce as many assets (for example, mortgage
loans) as possible without adequately screening their credit quality. 28
The rating process for structured finance products differs from the rating process for
corporate bonds, whose ratings are largely based on publicly available data such as audited
financial statements. The data used in rating structured finance products is primarily provided by
the sponsor, depositor, or underwriter. 29 Unlike credit ratings for corporate bonds, credit ratings
of structured finance products are “highly sensitive to the assumptions of 1) default probability
and recovery value, 2) correlation of defaults, and 3) the relation between payoffs and the
economic states that investors care about most.” 30 The rating process for these products may
happen in the reverse of how a more traditional product is rated because the sponsor, depositor,
arranger, or underwriter often decides before the structure is finalized what credit rating it would

See Amiyatosh Purnanandam, Originate-to-Distribute Model and the Subprime Mortgage Crisis, 24(6)
REV. FIN. STUD. 1881-1915 (2011). The author argues that, during the financial crisis, banks with high
involvement in the originate-to-distribute market originated excessively poor-quality mortgages, consistent
with the view that the originating banks did not expend resources to adequately screen the credit quality of
their borrowers.

See Summary Report of Issues Identified in the Commission Staff’s Examinations of Select Credit Rating
Agencies (July 2008), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2008/craexamination070808.pdf
(“2008 Staff Inspection Report”), pp. 7-10. The report describes the rating process for a residential
mortgage-backed security (“RMBS”) and CDO at the three examined credit rating agencies (Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investor’s Services, Inc., and Fitch, Inc.). For example, with respect to a
involving subprime loans, the arranger of the RMBS typically initiates the rating process by sending the
credit rating agency data on each of the subprime loans to be held by the trust (for example, principal
amount, geographic location of the property, credit history and FICO score of the borrower, ratio of the
loan amount to the value of the property, and type of loan), the proposed capital structure of the trust and
the proposed levels of credit enhancement for each tranche issued by the trust. Id. at 7. Upon receipt of the
information, the credit rating agency assigns a lead analyst who is responsible for analyzing the loan pool,
the proposed capital structure, and the proposed credit enhancement levels and, ultimately, for formulating
a rating recommendation to a rating committee composed of analysts and/or senior-level analytic
personnel. Id. at 7. The rating committee votes on the credit ratings for each tranche and usually
communicates its decision to the issuer. Id. at 9. In most cases, the issuer can appeal a rating decision,
although the appeal is not always granted (and, if granted, may not necessarily result in any change in the
rating decision). Typically, the credit rating agency is paid for determining the credit rating only if the
credit rating is issued.

30

See Coval, Jurek, and Stafford, The Economics of Structured Finance, p. 23. The authors argue that,

performance of securities created by tranching large asset pools is strongly affected by the performance of
the economy as a whole.” Id. at 23.

like for each tranche of securities to be issued, within the limits of what is possible, and
structures the product accordingly (for example, with regard to selecting the underlying assets
and establishing the credit enhancements applicable to the different tranches of securities).
Concerns have been raised that the inherently iterative nature of the process between the credit
rating agency and the sponsor, depositor, arranger, or underwriter may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest 31 and that credit rating agencies marketing advisory and consulting services
to their clients during this process may accentuate the conflict. 32
Just prior to the financial crisis, the size of the structured finance market was
considerable. New issuances of RMBS, for example, peaked in 2006 for a total of $801.7
billion.33 Low interest rates drove investor demand for products that had high yields but also
were highly rated by the credit rating agencies. 34 Mortgage originators largely exhausted the
supply of traditional quality mortgages and, to keep up with investor demand for RMBS,
subprime lending became increasingly popular. As the number of delinquencies on subprime

See Coffee Testimony I, p. 3, (“Today, the rating agency receives one fee to consult with a client, explain
its model, and indicate the likely outcome of the rating process; then, it receives a second fee to actually
deliver the rating (if the client wishes to go forward once it has learned the likely outcome)”). Rule 17g-6
prohibits, among other things, an NRSRO from conditioning or threatening to condition the issuance of a
credit rating on the purchase by an obligor or issuer, or an affiliate of the obligor or issuer, of any other
services or products, including pre-credit rating assessment products, of the NRSRO or any person
associated with the NRSRO. See 17 CFR 240.17g-6(a)(1).

33

The total amount of new issuances is calculated by staff in the Commission’s Division of Economics and
Risk Analysis (“DERA”) using Asset-Backed Alert and Commercial Mortgage Alert databases. The
amounts include only non-agency RMBS sold in the United States through Commission-registered
offerings, Rule 144A offerings, or traditional private offerings.

mortgages suddenly soared in late 2007, RMBS lost a considerable amount of value, 35 and
investors began to question the accuracy of credit ratings assigned to RMBS and CDOs linked to
RMBS. 36 Certain academic studies argue that, as the structured finance market boomed between
2004 and 2007, NRSROs might have had an incentive to generate revenue by relaxing rating
standards, 37 inflating credit ratings, 38 facilitating the sale of asset-backed securities by a small
number of large issuers, 39 and reducing due diligence in the presence of investors that solely rely
on credit ratings. 40 The concerns about the accuracy of credit ratings fueled an emergent

rating agency frequently made positive adjustments outside its main model that resulted in increasingly
larger AAA tranche sizes. These adjustments are difficult to explain by likely determinants, such as
manager experience or credit enhancements, but exhibit a clear pattern: CDOs with smaller model-implied
AAA sizes receive larger adjustments and CDOs with larger adjustments experience more severe
subsequent downgrading.

accounting for 39% of all newly issued securities; between 2004 and 2006, a larger fraction of MBS sold
by large issuers received triple-A ratings than MBS sold by small issuers; and tranches sold by large issuers
then experienced larger price drops than those sold by smaller issuers when the “housing bubble” began to

authors develop a model of competition among credit rating agencies that includes two types of investors
with different incentives to perform due diligence: sophisticated and “trusting” investors. Trusting
investors take credit ratings at face value because their compensation depends only marginally on the expost returns of the assets they manage. In the authors’ view, regulation that forces money managers to only
purchase investments with good credit ratings could also provide incentives to be trusting. The authors find
that competition can reduce efficiency, as it facilitates rating shopping. Moreover, credit ratings are more
likely to be inflated during booms and when investors are more trusting.

reluctance to invest in these products. 41 The new issuances of RMBS totaled $715.3 billion in
2007 and plunged to $34.5 billion in 2008.
In August 2007, the Commission staff initiated examinations of the three largest credit
rating agencies to review their role in the turmoil in the subprime mortgage-related securities
markets. 42 Among other things, these examinations revealed that the credit rating agencies
struggled to adjust the number of staff and resources employed in the rating process to the
increasing volume and complexity of RMBS and CDOs. 43 Certain significant aspects of the
rating process and methodologies used to rate RMBS and CDOs were not documented or
disclosed. 44 The credit rating agencies examined did not have specific written procedures for
rating RMBS and CDOs. 45 Also, the credit rating agencies did not appear to have specific
written policies and procedures to identify or address errors in their models or methodologies. 46
In certain instances, Commission staff believed that adjustments to models were made without
appropriately documenting a rationale for deviations from the model. 47 Processes for performing
surveillance and monitoring of outstanding credit ratings on an ongoing basis appeared to be less
robust than the processes for determining initial credit ratings. 48 Moreover, in the Commission

address all significant aspects of the RMBS and/or CDO ratings process. For example, written materials
set forth guidelines for the structured finance ratings committee process (including its composition, the
roles of the lead analyst and chair, the contents of the committee memo and the voting process) but did not
describe the ratings process and the analyst’s responsibilities prior to the time a proposed rating is

other business interests from influencing credit ratings or rating criteria. 49 Finally, the examined
credit rating agencies appeared to solely rely on the information provided by RMBS sponsors. 50
In particular, they did not appear to verify the integrity and accuracy of such information as, in
their view, due diligence duties belonged to other parties and they did not appear to seek
representations from sponsors that due diligence was performed. 51
Following the financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated regulatory actions intended
to enhance regulation, accountability, and transparency of NRSROs. 52 Generally, the majority of
the rulemaking mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act addresses all classes of credit ratings, rather
than credit ratings for only structured finance products. 53 In implementing the mandate, the
amendments and new rules being adopted today are designed to further enhance the governance
of NRSROs in their role as “gatekeepers” 54 and increase the transparency of the credit rating
process as a whole. Further, as discussed in section II. of this release, the amendments and new
rules being adopted today include new requirements designed to enhance transparency with
respect to structured finance products, including requirements for NRSROs to disclose

One commenter suggested that the proposed rules are overly broad in their application and “fail to
sufficiently account for the differences between corporate ratings (such as financial strength ratings of
insurance companies) and ratings of the structured and asset-backed financial products that contributed to
the recent economic crisis.” See A.M. Best Letter. The Commission notes that the amendments and new
rules being adopted today reflect the statutory mandate that generally, with one exception, was not limited
to certain classes of credit ratings. In particular, sections 932, 936 and 938 of the Dodd-Frank Act
generally do not focus exclusively on activities relating to rating structured finance products, with the
exception of section 932(s)(4) (which focuses on third-party due diligence services with respect to assetbacked securities).

2.

Baseline

The amendments and new rules being adopted today primarily affect NRSROs, issuers,
and underwriters of asset-backed securities, and providers of third-party due diligence services
for asset-backed securities. To the extent that the new requirements change the business
practices of the primarily affected parties, such changes may also affect clients of NRSROs (that
is, obligors who pay NRSROs to obtain entity credit ratings, issuers who pay NRSROs to obtain
credit ratings for their issued securities, subscribers who pay NRSROs to access credit ratings
and research, and persons who pay NRSROs for other services), credit raters or credit rating
agencies other than NRSROs, parties involved in asset-backed securities markets (other than
issuers, underwriters, third-party due diligence providers, and NRSROs), and users of credit
ratings in general.
The baseline against which economic costs and benefits, as well the impact of the
amendments and new rules being adopted today on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation, are measured is the situation in existence today, prior to the adoption of the
amendments and rules. The baseline includes an estimate of the number of entities that will
likely be directly affected by the amendments and rules and a description of the relevant features
of the regulatory and economic environment in which the affected entities operate. The

NRSROs

As discussed above, the Rating Agency Act of 2006, among other things, amended
section 3 of the Exchange Act to add definitions, added section 15E to the Exchange Act to
establish self-executing requirements for NRSROs and provide the Commission with the
authority to implement a registration and oversight program for NRSROs, amended section 17 of
the Exchange Act to provide the Commission with recordkeeping, reporting, and examination
authority over NRSROs, and amended section 21B(a) of the Exchange Act to provide the
Commission with the authority to assess penalties “against any person” in administrative
proceedings instituted under section 15E of the Exchange Act. 56
To implement the Rating Agency Act of 2006, the Commission adopted Rules 17g-1
through 17g-6 and Form NRSRO. 57 Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the
Commission adopt rules requiring an NRSRO to include in any report accompanying a credit
rating of an asset-backed security a description of the representations, warranties, and
enforcement mechanisms available to investors and how they differ from the representations,
warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar securities. 58 In January 2011,
the Commission adopted Rule 17g-7 to implement section 943. 59 The Exchange Act, Rules 17g1 through 17g-7, and Form NRSRO represent the baseline for the amendments and new rules

being adopted today in terms of requirements applicable to NRSROs.
Pursuant to section 6 of the Rating Agency Act of 2006, the Commission is required to
submit an annual report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate
and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives that includes the views
of the Commission on the state of competition, transparency, and conflicts of interest among
NRSROs. 60 In addition, section 15E(b) of the Exchange Act provides that not later than ninety
days after the end of each calendar year, each NRSRO shall file with the Commission an
amendment to its registration application, in such form as the Commission, by rule, may
prescribe: (1) certifying that the information and documents in the application for registration
continue to be accurate; (2) listing any material change that occurred to such information or
documents during the previous calendar year; and (3) amending its credit ratings performance
statistics. 61 Rule 17g-1 requires these filings (“annual certifications”) to be made on Form
NRSRO. 62 Further, each NRSRO is required to furnish the Commission with annual reports
containing audited financial statements and information about revenues and other matters. 63 The
Commission’s annual reports submitted to Congress and the NRSROs’ annual certifications and
annual reports are an integral part of establishing the baseline for the amendments and new rules
being adopted today, as discussed below.
As of today, there are ten credit rating agencies registered with the Commission as
NRSROs. 64 Based on the annual reports the NRSROs furnish with the Commission, in their

The ten NRSROs are: A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”); DBRS, Inc. (“DBRS”); Egan-Jones
Ratings Company (“EJR”); Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”); HR Ratings de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (“HR Ratings”);

2013 fiscal years, the ten NRSROs had $5.4 billion of total revenue – an approximate 6%
increase over their 2012 fiscal years. In addition, based on their annual certifications, the
NRSROs employed a total of 4,218 credit analysts at the end of the 2013 calendar year. Table 1
shows the number of credit analysts employed by each NRSRO at the end of the 2013 calendar
year and, of the total number of credit analysts employed by the NRSROs, the percent of credit
analysts at S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch (90%) and the remaining seven NRSROs (10%).

Among other things, the operations of the ten NRSROs differ in terms of business model,
classes of credit ratings for which they are registered, history of issuing credit ratings, size, and
market share. Of the ten NRSROs, seven operate primarily under the issuer-pay model, 65 in
which an obligor pays the NRSRO to rate it as an entity or an issuer pays the NRSRO to rate the
Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (“JCR”); Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. (“Kroll”); Moody’s Investor’s
Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”); Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC (“Morningstar”); and Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services (“S&P”). See Commission staff, Annual Report on Nationally Recognized Statistical
Rating Organizations (Dec. 2013), p. 6, available at

securities it issues. 66 One NRSRO operates exclusively under the subscriber-pay model, 67 in
which subscribers pay a fee to access the credit ratings issued by the NRSRO. 68 Two NRSROs
previously operated primarily under the subscriber-pay model but for several years have been
issuing an increasing number of credit ratings paid for by the obligor being rated or the issuer of
the securities that are rated. 69
The ten NRSROs also differ by the scope of their business and, in particular, by whether
their operations include products and services other than credit ratings, 70 which can be provided

66

The issuer-pay model often raises concerns of potential conflicts of interest because the collection of fees
from rated entities and issuers of rated securities, as a principal source of revenue, may provide an NRSRO
with an economic incentive to issue inflated ratings as a way to promote business with its clients. Several
academic studies try to answer theoretically and empirically the question of whether reputational concerns
of a credit rating agency effectively neutralize potential conflicts of interest in the issuer-pay model. The
conclusions of these studies are neither unanimous nor definite. For example, recently, Kashyap and
Kovrijnykh (2013) found that, under the issuer-pay model, a credit rating is less accurate than under the
subscriber-pay model. However, the authors found that subscribers tend to ask for a credit rating
inefficiently (that is, when the expected quality of the rated entity or security is sufficiently high) and that
the subscriber-pay model suffers from a potential free-riding problem. Cole and Cooley (2014) argue that
much of the regulatory concerns with the conflict created by issuers paying for ratings are a distraction.
The authors argue that in equilibrium, reputation ensures that credit ratings have value and reflect sound
assessments of creditworthiness. Regulatory reliance on credit ratings and the importance of risk-weighted
capital in prudential regulation more likely contributed to distorted credit ratings than the matter of who
pays for them. See Anil Kashyap and Natalia Kovrijnykh, Who Should Pay for Credit Ratings and How?,
NBER working paper No. 18923 (Mar. 2013); Harold Cole and Thomas F. Cooley, Rating Agencies,
NBER working paper No. 19972 (Mar. 2014).

67

The one NRSRO is EJR. See 2013 Annual Staff Report on NRSROs, p. 6.

68

See 2013 Annual Staff Report on NRSROs, p. 23. The subscriber-pay model also is subject to potential
conflicts of interest. See id. at p. 23. For example, the NRSRO may be aware that an influential subscriber
holds a securities position (long or short) that could be advantaged if a credit rating upgrade or downgrade
causes the market value of the security to increase or decrease; or that the subscriber invests in newly
issued bonds and would obtain higher yields if the bonds were to have lower credit ratings. Another
example of a conflict in the subscriber-pay model is that the NRSRO may be aware that a subscriber wishes
to acquire a particular security but is prevented from doing so because the credit rating of the security is
lower than internal investment guidelines or an applicable contract permit.

69

The two NRSROs are Kroll and Morningstar. See 2013 Annual Staff Report on NRSROs, p. 7.

70

Ancillary services often raise concerns of potential conflicts of interest because, for example, an NRSRO
might issue a more favorable credit rating to an issuer in exchange for purchasing ancillary services, or an
issuer that purchases a large amount of ancillary services might pressure the NRSRO to issue a more
favorable credit rating for the issuer. See 2013 Staff Report on Credit Rating Agency Independence, pp.
21-24. Another concern with respect to ancillary services is that they might have involved an NRSRO
making recommendations on the structure of a security to be rated. Id. at 22-23. Paragraph (c)(5) of Rule
17g-5 prohibits an NRSRO from issuing or maintaining a credit rating with respect to an obligor or security
where the NRSRO or a person associated with the NRSRO made recommendations to the obligor or the
issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of the security about the corporate or legal structure, assets, liabilities, or

23

through business lines, segments, groups, or divisions within the NRSROs or through affiliated
companies or other businesses not within the NRSRO. 71 For credit ratings, there are five classes
of credit ratings for which a credit rating agency can be registered as an NRSRO: (1) financial
institutions, brokers, or dealers; (2) insurance companies; (3) corporate issuers; (4) issuers of
asset-backed securities (as that term is defined in section 1101(c) of part 229 of Title 17, Code of
Federal Regulations, “as in effect on the date of enactment of this paragraph”); and (5) issuers of
government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign government. 72
Eight of the NRSROs are registered in multiple classes, while two NRSROs are registered in one
class. 73 Table 2 shows the approximate number of outstanding credit ratings as reported by each
NRSRO in its annual certification for the 2013 calendar year end, in each of the five categories
for which the NRSRO is registered.

activities of the obligor or issuer of the security. See 17 CFR 240.17g-5(c)(5). In addition, Rule 17g-6
prohibits, among other things, an NRSRO from: (1) conditioning or threatening to condition the issuance of
a credit rating on the purchase by an obligor or issuer, or an affiliate of the obligor or issuer, of any other
services or products, including pre-credit rating assessment products, of the NRSRO or any person
associated with the NRSRO; (2) issuing, or offering or threatening to issue, a credit rating that is not
determined in accordance with the NRSRO’s established procedures and methodologies for determining
credit ratings, based on whether the rated person, or an affiliate of the rated person, purchases or will
purchase the credit rating or any other service or product of the NRSRO or any person associated with the
NRSRO; and (3) modifying, or offering or threatening to modify, a credit rating in a manner that is
contrary to the NRSRO’s established procedures and methodologies for modifying credit ratings based on
whether the rated person, or an affiliate of the rated person, purchases or will purchase the credit rating or
any other service or product of the NRSRO or any person associated with the NRSRO. See 17 CFR
240.17g-6.

Note: The approximate number of NRSRO credit ratings outstanding as of December 31, 2013 is provided by each NRSRO in its
annual certification, which is available on each NRSRO’s website. “N/R” indicates that an NRSRO is not registered for that
class of credit rating.

As shown in Table 2, S&P has the greatest number of outstanding credit ratings in each
of the five classes. S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch are the top three producers of credit ratings in
every class of credit ratings except for insurance companies (in this class, A.M. Best has the
second highest number of outstanding credit ratings after S&P). Overall, S&P accounts for
about 46% of the total NRSRO credit ratings outstanding, followed by Moody’s (37%) and Fitch
(13%), implying that two NRSROs (S&P and Moody’s) account for 83% of all credit ratings
outstanding and three NRSROs (S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch) account for approximately 97%.
Also, as discussed above, Table 1 shows that these three NRSROs employ 90% of the total
number of NRSRO credit analysts. Comparing the number of credit ratings outstanding for
established NRSROs and newly registered NRSROs may not provide a complete picture of
competition in the industry. The incumbent NRSROs (particularly S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch)
have a longer history of issuing credit ratings, and their credit ratings include those for debt

25

obligations and obligors that were rated long before the establishment of the newer entrants. 74
Recent trends in the industry structure are shown in Table 3, which reports the inverse of
the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) as a measure of industry concentration by rating class. 75
The HHI inverse is calculated from 2007 to 2013 for credit ratings outstanding as reported by the
NRSROs in each rating class. Table 3 shows that the NRSRO industry concentration for all
rating classes has moderately increased as suggested by the decrease in the HHI inverse since
2010. Despite a monotonic increase in competition in the rating class of asset-backed securities,
the NRSRO industry remains concentrated, with the three largest NRSROs accounting for
approximately 95% of the NRSROs’ 2013 fiscal year total revenue, based on the annual reports
the NRSROs furnish to the Commission.

Note: The inverse of HHI is determined using the approximate numbers of NRSRO credit ratings outstanding reported in the
Commission staff annual reports on NRSROs published in June 2008, September 2009, January 2011, March 2012, December
2012, and December 2013. For the 2013 calendar year end, the inverse of HHI is calculated using the number of outstanding
credit ratings reported by NRSROs in their annual certifications.

In particular, for the asset-backed security class – which includes, among other things,
RMBS, commercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”), and consumer finance and other
asset-backed securities – Table 4 below shows the number of credit ratings outstanding from
2007 to 2013. The total number of outstanding credit ratings has significantly decreased (by
38%) since 2007, mostly due to pay-downs of existing asset-backed securities that have not been
74

See 2013 Annual Staff Report on NRSROs, p. 12.

75

The inverse of HHI can be interpreted as the number of equally-sized firms necessary to replicate the
degree of concentration in a particular industry.

replaced by newly issued asset-backed securities that are rated by NRSROs. 76 While the three
largest NRSROs accounted for 97% of the outstanding credit ratings for asset-backed securities
in 2007, this number decreased to 90% in 2013.

Note: “N/R” indicates that an NRSRO is not registered for the asset-backed security class of credit ratings and “–” indicates that
the credit rating agency was not registered as an NRSRO for the applicable year. Kroll acquired LACE Financial Corp. in
August 2010. Morningstar, formerly known as Realpoint LLC, changed its name in 2011. Rating and Investment Information,
Inc. (“R&I”) withdrew its registration as an NRSRO with the Commission in October 2011. HR Ratings became registered as an
NRSRO in 2012. Statistics come from the Commission staff annual reports on NRSROs published in June 2008, September
2009, January 2011, March 2012, December 2012, and December 2013. For calendar year 2013, the statistics come from the
annual certifications of the NRSROs.

In 2013, some of the relatively newer or smaller NRSROs increased their market shares
in terms of rating asset-backed securities. Table 5 reports full-year credit rating agency
information for 2013, compared to 2007, the year immediately prior to the financial crisis. As
the total issuances of asset-backed securities decreased considerably from 2007 to 2013, DBRS
has maintained its market share in rating new issuances and has become the most active
participant in rating RMBS, while S&P, Moody’s and Fitch have lost market shares. DBRS,
Kroll, and Morningstar have gained market shares in rating CMBS after the financial crisis and
have rated a significant number of newly issued CMBS in 2013. Finally, in the market for rating
76

consumer finance and other asset-backed securities, which has the largest number of issuances,
DBRS and Kroll have increased their market shares, although S&P, Moody’s and Fitch continue
to play a significant role.

Note: A single offering of asset-backed securities may consist of multiple tranches of securities. An NRSRO may rate one or
multiple tranches of the securities issued in the offering. Market shares of individual NRSROs do not add up to 100% since more
than one NRSRO may rate a particular offering. “N/A” indicates that statistics are not available for 2007. CMBS data relates to
U.S. CMBS, including U.S. conduit/fusion and U.S. single borrower. Data comes from Asset-Backed Alert and Commercial

Asset-Backed Security Issuers, Underwriters, and Third-Party
Due Diligence Providers

The asset-backed security market that existed in the United States as of the end of 2013
differed significantly from the market prior to the crisis. In 2004, issuing entities of non-agency
asset-backed securities held $2.6 trillion in assets, which grew to $4.5 trillion in 2007 and

28

declined to $1.6 trillion in 2013. 77 Table 6 presents issuance amounts, number of offerings, and
number of unique issuers for non-agency asset-backed securities, categorized by type of
offering. 78 While new issuances of registered asset-backed securities represented the majority of
offerings and totaled $1.0 trillion in 2004, they drastically dropped to $140.7 billion in 2008. In
2013, the asset-backed security market totaled $393.6 billion, of which $174.1 billion is the new
issuance amount of registered asset-backed securities.

Note: Statistics are calculated by DERA using the Asset-Backed Alert and Commercial Mortgage Alert databases. A single
offering of asset-backed securities may consist of multiple tranches of securities. An NRSRO may rate one or multiple tranches
of the securities issued in the offering. The offerings are categorized by offering year and offering type (Commission registered,
Rule 144A, or traditional private offerings). Non-agency asset-backed securities include RMBS, CMBS, and other asset-backed
securities. Non-agency RMBS include residential, Alt-A, subprime RMBS, high loan-to-value ("no-equity") loans, and non-U.S.
residential loans. Auto loan asset-backed securities include asset-backed securities backed by auto loans and auto leases, both
prime and subprime, motorcycle loans, recreational vehicle loans, and truck loans. The first set of columns show the total
issuance amounts in billions of dollars. The second set of columns show the total number of asset-backed security offerings. The
third set of columns show the number of unique issuers of asset-backed securities in each category. The number in the column
“Total” may not be the sum of numbers in the columns “Regist’d”, “144A” and “Private” because some issuers may initiate
offerings in several categories. Only non-agency asset-backed security offerings sold in the United States and issuers of such
offerings are counted.

Issuers of asset-backed securities often include banks, mortgage companies, finance
companies, investment banks, and other entities that originate or acquire and package financial

This information is derived from data compiled by the Federal Reserve and published in quarterly Z.1
releases, which are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/Z1/default.htm. Statistics include
private mortgage pools, consumer credit, business loans, student loans, consumer leases, and trade credit
securitization.

In this section of the release, the issuer of the asset-back security means the person that primarily organizes
and initiates the offering of the asset-backed security, often referred to as the sponsor.

assets for resale as asset-backed securities. 79 As reported in Table 6, in 2004 there were 298
unique issuers, while in 2013 there were 336 unique issuers, mostly involved in Rule 144A
offerings. 80 The ten most active issuers were responsible for about 30% of the total issuance
amounts at the end of 2013. 81
As noted in Figure 1 below, an analysis of the segments of the asset-backed security
market shows that all segments experienced significant downturns during the crisis but only a
few of them have experienced a recovery in the aftermath. Figure 1 focuses on non-agency
asset-backed security offerings and reports the issuance volume by main asset classes (RMBS,
CMBS, auto loans/leases, credit card loans, student loans, and other asset-backed securities).

79

See Asset-Backed Securities, Securities Act No. 8518 (Dec. 22, 2004), 70 FR 1506 (Jan. 7, 2005).

80

The number of issuers varies across segments of the asset-backed security market. For example, as of
December of 2013 there were twenty-two and eighty-three issuers involved in RMBS and CMBS offerings,
respectively.

Note: The offerings are categorized by offering year and underlying asset type. A single offering of asset-backed securities may
consist of multiple tranches of securities. An NRSRO may rate one or multiple tranches of the securities issued in the offering.
Non-agency RMBS include residential, Alt-A, and subprime RMBS, and asset-backed securities backed by home equity loans
and lines of credit. Only non-agency RMBS offerings sold in the United States are counted. Auto loan asset-backed securities
include asset-backed securities backed by auto loans, both prime and subprime, motorcycle loans, truck loans, and recreational
vehicle loans. Data is compiled from Asset-Backed Alert and Commercial Mortgage Alert databases.

As shown in Figure 1, new issuances of non-agency RMBS in 2004 totaled $542 billion,
with registered offerings representing the majority of non-agency RMBS issued before the crisis.
Non-agency RMBS issuance – which totaled $715 billion in 2007 – dropped drastically to $35
billion in 2008. As of the end of 2013, the non-agency RMBS market remains weak and consists
almost exclusively of unregistered RMBS offerings. In particular, new issuances of non-agency
RMBS totaled $25 billion in 2013, which represents about 5% of the issuance level in 2004.
CMBS experienced a similar drop in issuance levels, though it has rebounded to a level that is
closer to the 2004 issuance level than RMBS. In particular, CMBS issuance rose from $96
billion in 2004 to $231 billion in 2007. It then dropped to $12 billion in 2008. It was $86 billion
in 2013, which is about 90% of the issuance level in 2004. The consumer finance asset-backed
security market also declined drastically in terms of number of offerings and issuance volume
after the financial crisis. For example, $70 billion of securities backed by auto loans and leases

31

were issued in 2004, but issuance decreased to $38 billion in 2008. The issuances of consumer
finance asset-backed securities, especially those securities backed by auto loans and leases, and
other asset-backed securities have steadily increased since 2008 to reach pre-crisis levels of
about $75 billion in 2013.
Among the asset-backed security segments, the non-agency RMBS segment has
experienced a significant decline in the number of issuers with twenty-two issuers arranging nonagency RMBS (and only one issuer arranging non-agency registered RMBS) as of the end of
2013, compared to fifty-eight issuers in 2004. In the RMBS market, issuers arranging nonagency RMBS encounter competitive pressure from government-sponsored enterprises that
arrange RMBS that are guaranteed 82 and exempt from registration and reporting requirements. 83
As non-agency RMBS issuance has declined, issuance of agency RMBS has increased.
Issuances of RMBS arranged by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the Government National Mortgage Association were $1.4
trillion in 2004 and grew to $1.9 trillion in 2013.84
Table 7 shows the number of unique underwriters of non-agency asset-backed securities.
As of the end of 2013, it is a highly concentrated industry with ninety underwriters (if
international securitizations are included in the data) and fifty underwriters (if international

Mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises and the Government National
Mortgage Association have been and continue to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act and
most provisions of the federal securities laws. For example, the mortgage-backed securities issued by the
Government National Mortgage Association are exempt securities under section 3(a)(2) of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(2)) and section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)). The chartering
legislation for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation contain exemptions with respect to the mortgage-backed securities issued by these entities.

Note: Statistics are calculated by DERA staff using the Asset-Backed Alert and Commercial Mortgage Alert databases. A single
offering of asset-backed securities may consist of multiple tranches of securities. An NRSRO may rate one or multiple tranches
of the securities issued in the offering. The number of unique underwriters of asset-backed securities is divided into categories
by type of offering (registered, 144A, private, or international). The total number in the last column may not be the sum of
numbers in the columns labeled “Public”, “144A”, “Private,” and “Internat’l” because some underwriters may market offerings
in several categories. Only non-agency asset-backed security offerings and underwriters of such deals are counted.

Finally, providers of third-party due diligence services with respect to asset-backed
securities are significantly affected by the amendments and new rules being adopted today. The
Commission has little information about these firms and the characteristics of the industry. The
Commission estimates that there are approximately fifteen providers of third-party due diligence
services. 86 Because there are very few publicly traded firms specializing in due diligence, little

The market share attributed to an asset-backed security underwriter is calculated by DERA staff using

This number comes from combining the names of third-party due diligence firms cited by Vicki Beal,
Senior Vice President of Clayton Holdings, in her testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission, and the names of third-party due diligence firms that S&P reviews as a part of its U.S. RMBS
rating process. See Testimony of Vicki Beal, Senior Vice President of Clayton Holdings before the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, (Sept. 23, 2010), available at http://fcicstatic.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-testimony/2010-0923-Beal.pdf (“Clayton Testimony”). S&P’s
updated list of third-party due diligence firms reviewed for U.S. RMBS is available at
https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/renderArticle.do?articleId=1246530&SctArtId=208825&f
rom=CM&nsl_code=LIME. The Commission does not know whether the estimate of fifteen providers of
third-party due diligence services captures all of the primary participants in this business but believes that,
based on available information, this is a reasonable estimate for purposes of this economic analysis.

33

is known about these service providers in terms of loan review volume, market share, and
revenue. 87
Asset-backed security issuers and underwriters may use third-party due diligence services
to identify issues with loans, to negotiate better prices on pools of loans they are considering for
purchase, and to negotiate expanded representations and warranties in purchase and sale
agreements from sellers. 88 The reviews of third-party due diligence providers are performed on
an adverse or random sample of loans consistent with the guidelines of clients. Compensation is
likely not contingent on due diligence findings or the ultimate performance of the loans
reviewed. Instead, third-party due diligence providers may be paid a standard service fee for
each loan reviewed. 89

Industry Practices

The Commission staff conducts annual examinations of each NRSRO and publishes a
report summarizing the essential findings of the examinations, as required by section 15E(p)(3)
of the Exchange Act. 90 The staff’s 2013 report noted improvements, relative to prior
examinations, among the NRSROs in five general areas that are related to the amendments and
new rules being adopted today: enhanced documentation, disclosure, and board of director
oversight of criteria and methodologies; investment in software or computer systems for
electronic recordkeeping and monitoring employee securities trading; increased prominence of

Section 923(a)(8) of the Dodd-Frank Act struck the existing text in paragraph (p) of section 15E of the
Exchange Act, which related to the date of applicability of the Rating Agency Act of 2006, and added new
text. See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 932(a)(8). Section 15E(p)(3) of the Exchange Act requires, among other
things, the Commission staff to conduct an examination of each NRSRO at least annually. See 15 U.S.C.

of internal controls over the rating process (for example, use of audits and other testing to verify
compliance with federal securities laws, and employee training on compliance matters); and
adherence to internal policies and procedures. 91 The report also discussed certain weaknesses or
concerns in a number of review areas: adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies; 92
management of conflicts of interest; 93 implementation of ethics policies; 94 internal supervisory
controls; 95 governance; 96 the activities of the designated compliance officer; 97 the processing of
complaints; 98 and the policies governing post-employment activities of former staff of the
NRSRO. 99 These essential findings were related to several areas of NRSRO operations and were
not limited to activities relating to rating asset-backed securities.

Broad Economic Considerations

In this section, the Commission describes the primary economic impacts that may derive
from the amendments and new rules being adopted today, relative to the baseline discussed
above. A detailed analysis of the particular economic effects – including the costs and benefits
and the impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation – that may result from the
amendments and rules is presented in the focused economic analyses in section II of this

release. 100
Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking
that requires the Commission to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, to also consider whether the action will promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 101 Further, section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the
Commission, when adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that any new
rule would have on competition and to not adopt any rule that would impose a burden on
competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange
Act. 102 The Commission’s analysis of the economic effects, including the likely costs and
benefits and the likely impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation of the
amendments and new rules, include those attributable to the rulemaking that the Commission is
mandated to undertake in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and those attributable to the
exercise of the Commission’s discretionary authority.
In the proposing release, the Commission solicited comments on all aspects of the costs
and benefits associated with the proposed rules. In addition to comments on the economic
effects of specific provisions, which will be discussed in section II of this release, the
Commission received comments on the overall economic effects of the proposed amendments
and new rules. Generally, commenters expressed concerns that the potential cumulative burden
and costs associated with the proposed amendments and new rules could be so onerous that they
would have negative effects on competition by imposing an excessive burden on smaller

NRSROs and raising barriers to entry for credit rating agencies that seek to register as
NRSROs. 103 In particular, one commenter suggested that “fostering competition among rating
agencies was a primary goal of both the Rating Agency Act of 2006 and the Dodd-Frank Act”
but that “the proposed rules will be so costly to implement that additional credit rating agencies
are unlikely to register as NRSROs and the existing pool of registrants may contract.” 104
As discussed in section II of this release, the Commission has considered these comments
and has modified the amendments and new rules being adopted today from the proposals in a
number of ways that are designed to reduce the cumulative burden and costs associated with
complying with the new requirements. Nonetheless, the Commission recognizes – as reflected in
the economic analysis – that the amendments and rules establish a substantial package of new
requirements applicable to NRSROs and that complying with these requirements will entail
significant costs to NRSROs. 105 The amendments and rules also impose burdens on issuers and
underwriters of asset-backed securities and providers of third-party due diligence services with
respect to asset-backed securities. As discussed throughout the economic analysis, the
Commission believes that the new requirements should result in substantial benefits and should
not impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act.
In particular, the amendments and new rules being adopted today are designed to
103

See A.M. Best Letter; DBRS Letter; EJR Letter; Kroll Letter; Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter;
TradeMetrics Letter.

104

See DBRS Letter. This commenter also stated that a “contradiction lies in the fact that, while directing the
Commission to impose costly and onerous new obligations on rating agencies who choose to register as
NRSROs, the Dodd-Frank Act also directs the Commission to remove all references to credit ratings from
the federal securities regulations.” See DBRS Letter. See also Pub. L. No. 111-203, 939A.

105

Some NRSROs may be subject to rules in foreign jurisdictions under which certain of their policies and
procedures or other practices are affected by requirements of these foreign jurisdictions that may be similar
to some of the requirements imposed by the amendments and new rules. While the requirements of foreign
jurisdictions are not analyzed here in detail, they may impact the incremental costs and benefits of the
amendments and new rules.

37

implement Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act, which, in turn, was designed to address
the causes of certain market failures (that is, the principal-agent problem, 106 including conflicts of
interest, and asymmetric information) that may impair the integrity and transparency of NRSRO
credit ratings and the procedures and methodologies NRSROs use to determine credit ratings.
Some of the amendments and new rules are primarily designed to enhance the integrity of how
NRSROs determine credit ratings by improving internal governance of NRSROs, managing
potential principal-agent problems and conflicts of interest in the credit rating process, and
promoting adherence to the procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings and
compliance with laws and regulations. 107 For example, provisions in the amendments and new
rules require an NRSRO, among other things, to: (1) assess and report on the effectiveness of
internal controls; (2) address conflicts of interest relating to sales and marketing activities and
employment of former analysts; (3) have policies and procedures relating to their procedures and
methodologies for determining credit ratings; (4) have standards of training, experience and
competence for their credit analysts; and (5) have policies and procedures to promote the
consistent use of credit rating symbols. 108
Other provisions in the amendments and new rules being adopted today are designed
mainly to enhance the transparency of NRSRO credit ratings by increasing disclosure and
reducing information asymmetries that may adversely affect users of credit ratings. This should

106

A principal–agent problem occurs when one person (the “agent”) is able to act in the person’s own best
interest rather than in the interest of another person (the “principal”). The problem arises when the parties
have different interests and the agent has more information than the principal so that the principal cannot
ensure that the agent is always acting in the principal’s best interests, especially where activities that are
useful to the principal are costly to the agent and where monitoring of the agent’s activities is costly to the
principal. For example, a principal-agent problem may arise if an NRSRO produces credit ratings that, as a
result of conflicts of interest, are not informative to the users of credit ratings.

107

These requirements are discussed below in sections II.A., II.B., II.C., II.D., II.F., II.I., II.J., and II.K. of this
release.

108

These requirements are discussed below in sections II.A., II.B., II.C., II.F., II.I., and II.J. of this release.

38

facilitate external scrutiny of NRSRO activities. More specifically, provisions in the
amendments and new rules require an NRSRO, among other things, to disclose: (1) standardized
performance statistics; (2) increased information about credit rating histories; (3) information
about material changes and significant errors in the procedures and methodologies used to
determine credit ratings; and (4) information about a specific rating action. 109 The main
objective of these requirements is to improve the information provided to users of credit ratings,
including investors. The enhanced disclosure may reduce information asymmetries between the
NRSRO and the users of its credit ratings, enabling the users to make more informed investment
and credit related decisions and allowing them to compare the performance of credit ratings by
different NRSROs. Additionally, there are requirements in the amendments and new rules that
are designed to reduce information asymmetries among issuers and underwriters of asset-backed
securities, NRSROs rating asset-backed securities, and the users of credit ratings for assetbacked securities. 110 These requirements may benefit NRSROs and users of credit ratings,
including investors in these securities.
a.

Amendments and Rules Enhancing NRSRO Governance and
Integrity of Credit Ratings

The requirements in the amendments and new rules being adopted today that are
primarily designed to enhance an NRSRO’s internal governance should have economic benefits,
relative to the existing baseline, in terms of promoting the integrity of how NRSROs determine
and monitor credit ratings. In particular, there are new requirements applicable to NRSROs that
assign responsibilities to an NRSRO’s management and board of directors, which should
promote accountability and facilitate internal oversight over the processes governing the

109

These requirements are discussed below in sections II.E., II.F., II.G., and II.L. of this release.

110

These requirements are discussed below in sections II.E., II.G., and II.H of this release.

39

determination of credit ratings and the implementation of the procedures and methodologies an
NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings. For example, an NRSRO is required to file an annual
report containing an assessment by management of the effectiveness during the fiscal year of the
internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures,
and methodologies for determining credit ratings. 111 Similarly, an NRSRO is required to
establish, maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that the procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and
models, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings are approved by its board of directors or a
body performing a function similar to that of a board of directors. 112 The board’s oversight may
prevent situations in which an NRSRO seeks to implement a procedure or methodology to
determine credit ratings that is designed to inappropriately issue favorable credit ratings for
existing and prospective clients in order to retain or gain market share. 113
There are new requirements applicable to NRSROs pursuant to which they must avoid
certain conflicts of interest and have policies and procedures to take certain actions to address
credit ratings that are influenced by a conflict of interest. 114 These requirements may facilitate
the alignment of incentives at both the NRSRO and individual NRSRO employee level to
ultimately promote the production of unbiased credit ratings. At the NRSRO level, for example,
sales and marketing considerations may influence the NRSRO’s production of credit ratings.
Consequently, there is a new requirement that prohibits an NRSRO from issuing or maintaining
a credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in determining or monitoring

the credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for determining
the credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative models, also: (1) participates in sales or
marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a product or service of an affiliate of the
NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or marketing considerations. 115 This absolute prohibition
should result in internal policies, procedures, and organizational solutions that isolate the
analytical function from sales and marketing considerations within the NRSRO. To the extent
that the absolute prohibition prevents credit analysts that participate in the determination of
credit ratings from being influenced by sales and marketing considerations, this should curb
potential conflicts of interest related to “rating catering” practices that have been suggested by
anecdotal evidence 116 and academic literature. 117 Isolating the production of credit ratings and
the development of procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings from sales and
marketing considerations should promote the integrity and quality of credit ratings to the benefit
of their users.
At the individual level, an analyst’s incentives may be distorted by the prospect of future
employment at an issuer or underwriter, which could influence the analyst in determining a
credit rating for that issuer or underwriter. Consequently, there is a new requirement that an

See John M. Griffin, Jordan Nickerson, Dragon Yongjun Tang, Rating Shopping or Catering? An
Examination of the Response to Competitive Pressure for CDO Credit Ratings, REV. FIN. ST. 2270-2310
(2013). The authors draw a distinction between rating shopping and rating catering. “Rating shopping”
refers to a situation in which issuers solicit ratings from multiple credit rating agencies and then hire the
credit rating agencies that will issue the most favorable credit ratings (Skreta and Veldkamp, 2009). Even
though rating agencies adhere to their rating procedures and methodologies and issue unbiased ratings,
credit rating inflation is a natural consequence of the rating shopping process and is not driven by the rating
agencies. “Rating catering” refers to a situation in which issuers solicit credit ratings from multiple credit
rating agencies and the credit rating agencies may not strictly adhere to their procedures and methodologies
for determining credit ratings in order to issue more favorable credit ratings. The authors argue that under
pressure from investment banks, the credit rating agency with a more stringent procedure or methodology
for determining credit ratings stretches the procedure or methodology to match more lenient competitors
(Bolton, Freixas, and Shapiro, 2012).

41

NRSRO must have policies and procedures that address instances in which this conflict of
interest influenced a credit rating that are reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO
promptly determines whether the current credit rating must be revised so that it no longer is
influenced by a conflict of interest and is solely a product of the documented procedures and
methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings and to promptly publish a revised
credit rating, an affirmation of the credit rating, or potentially place the credit rating on watch or
review and in each case include certain disclosures about the existence of the conflict. 118 This
provision is designed to require the NRSRO to promptly address a conflicted credit rating, and it
will likely limit the potential risk that users of credit ratings may make investment decisions
using biased or inaccurate information. The disclosures also should provide information to
investors and other users of credit ratings that they can use to scrutinize an NRSRO, thereby
promoting accountability to the market for failing to appropriately manage this conflict of
interest.
In terms of accountability, the Commission is finalizing a rule amendment pursuant to
which an NRSRO could have its registration suspended or revoked for violating a rule governing
conflicts of interest. 119 In addition, the Commission is amending Form NRSRO to provide
notice to an NRSRO or a credit rating agency applying for registration as an NRSRO that an
NRSRO is subject to applicable fines, penalties, and other sanctions under the Exchange Act. 120
This may serve as a reminder to the NRSRO or applicant of the potential consequences of failing
to comply with federal laws and regulations. Taken together, these accountability measures may
have incremental effects on the integrity of an NRSRO’s activities and credit ratings by

promoting compliance with the Commission’s rules.
There are new requirements applicable to NRSROs pursuant to which they must
establish, maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures that are reasonably designed
to ensure that: (1) the procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data
and models, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings are developed and modified in
accordance with the policies and procedures of the NRSRO; and (2) material changes to the
procedures and methodologies, including changes to qualitative and quantitative data and
models, that the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings are applied consistently to all current
and future credit ratings to which the changed procedures or methodologies apply and, to the
extent that the changes are to surveillance or monitoring procedures and methodologies, applied
to current credit ratings to which the changed procedures or methodologies apply within a
reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the number of credit ratings impacted, the
complexity of the procedures and methodologies used to determine the credit ratings, and the
type of obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated. 121 To the extent that these
policies and procedures are effectively implemented and enforced, their application may enhance
the integrity of how NRSROs determine credit ratings.
There are new requirements applicable to NRSROs pursuant to which they must
establish, maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for
the individuals they employ to participate in the determination of credit ratings that are
reasonably designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produces accurate credit ratings in
the classes of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. At a minimum, these standards
must include: (1) a requirement for periodic testing of the individuals employed by the NRSRO

121

This requirement is discussed below in section II.F.1. of this release.

43

to participate in the determination of credit ratings on their knowledge of the procedures and
methodologies used by the NRSRO to determine credit ratings in the classes and subclasses of
credit ratings for which the individual participates in determining credit ratings; and (2) a
requirement that at least one individual with an appropriate level of experience in performing
credit analysis, but not less than three years, participates in the determination of a credit rating. 122
These requirements may increase the level of competence and experience of the credit analysts
employed by the NRSRO to participate in the production of credit ratings with possible positive
effects on the integrity and quality of credit ratings. 123
There are new requirements applicable to NRSROs pursuant to which they must have
reasonably designed policies and procedures relating to: (1) assessing the probability that an
issuer of a security or money market instrument will default, fail to make timely payments, or
otherwise not make payments in accordance with the terms of the security or money market
instrument; (2) clearly defining each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the
NRSRO and including the definitions in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO; and (3) applying any
symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO in a manner that is consistent
for all types of obligors, securities, and money market instruments for which the symbol,
number, or score is used. 124 Compliance with these policies and procedures may increase the
likelihood that NRSROs apply rating symbols, numbers, or scores consistently across classes of
credit ratings to the benefit of the users of credit ratings and obligors and issuers that are subject

Analysts in Determining Ratings (2014), available at

credit analysts covering a firm significantly affects the firm’s credit rating, comparing credit ratings for the
same firm at the same time across credit rating agencies. Analyst effects account for 30% of the variation
within credit ratings. In addition, the quality of credit ratings varies with observable analyst characteristics.

to credit ratings.
Finally, there are new requirements applicable to NRSROs pursuant to which they must
retain records of certain internal controls, policies, procedures and standards they are required to
document. 125 These record retention requirements should facilitate Commission oversight of
NRSROs to the benefit of users of credit ratings. Similarly, the Exchange Act requires an annual
report of the NRSRO’s designated compliance officer to be filed on a confidential basis with the
Commission. 126 The new requirement should facilitate Commission oversight as well.
There will be costs associated with the amendments and new rules being adopted today
related to governance of NRSROs. 127 These costs will be primarily incurred by NRSROs. 128
Initial and ongoing direct costs, including compliance costs, may vary among the NRSROs
depending on the size and complexity of their business activities (for example, number of credit
ratings outstanding, number of analysts, or number of classes of credit ratings). Among other
costs, NRSROs also may incur training costs in order to make their personnel aware of the
changes in internal controls, policies, and procedures required by the amendments and new rules.
These costs are difficult to quantify because they depend significantly on how the required
changes differ from the internal policies and procedures currently in place within each NRSRO.
In addition, they depend on factors such as the NRSRO’s size and business complexity. For
example, an NRSRO may need to train its credit analysts and sales and marketing staff in the
updated policies and procedures related to the sales and marketing conflict requirements.

125

These requirements are discussed below in sections II.A.2., II.C.2., II.F.2., II.I.2., and II.J.2. of this release.

A detailed analysis of the economic costs, including compliance costs that can potentially result from each
amendment and/or rule is presented in the focused economic analyses in section II of this release. See

II.M.5. of this release.

128

NRSROs may be able to pass some of the incremental costs to their clients.

45

Among other factors, this cost will likely vary significantly with the degree of the existing
separation between the functions of analytical staff and sales and marketing personnel. 129
Keeping all other factors constant, the costs associated with establishing, maintaining,
enforcing, and documenting internal policies and procedures may be higher for structured
finance products because the inherent conflict of interest that credit rating agencies face in rating
these products is more acute than it is with respect to rating other types of securities. 130 In
addition, keeping all other factors constant, NRSROs operating under a business model that
combines the issuer-pay and subscriber-pay models may face greater direct costs, given that the
two models may entail different internal policies and procedures to prevent different sources of
potential conflicts of interest. A component of these costs may also be fixed, which may have a
disproportionate impact on smaller NRSROs that may find it more difficult to bear the costs. If
NRSROs are not able to readily pass the overall additional costs to clients, there may be adverse
effects, particularly on smaller NRSROs.
As a result of the amendments and new rules being adopted today, the number of credit
rating agencies registered with the Commission as NRSROs may decline if current registrants
believe that the cost of being registered and being subject to these new requirements outweighs
the benefit of registration. The barriers to entry for credit rating agencies to register as NRSROs
may rise, discouraging credit rating agencies from registering as NRSROs. Further, historically,
successful new entrants have established themselves by first specializing in a particular industry,
creating a track record in a particular rating class, and building the necessary reputational capital

(“In the case of structured finance products, the Commission believes this ‘issuer/underwriter-pay’ conflict
is particularly acute because certain arrangers of structured finance products repeatedly bring ratings
business to the NRSROs. As sources of frequent, repeated deal-based revenue, some arrangers have the
potential to exert greater undue influence on an NRSRO than, for example, a corporate issuer that may
bring far less ratings business to the NRSRO.”) (footnotes omitted).

46

to achieve marketplace acceptance of their credit ratings. 131 Compliance costs may reduce the
incentive for an NRSRO to expand its rating business into new classes of credit ratings, with
adverse effects on competition in certain market segments. Also, if compliance costs
significantly erode profit margins for NRSROs, the barriers to exit from being registered as an
NRSRO in certain or all classes of credit ratings may lower. The risk for deregistration may
likely be higher for smaller NRSROs. As mentioned earlier, these costs also should depend on
the complexity of operations within the NRSRO. Further, given that the conflict of interest in
rating structured finance products is more acute, the competitive effects could be greater within
the markets for rating these products. These potential consequences could reduce competition
among NRSROs.
An amendment being adopted today provides a mechanism for a small NRSRO to seek
an exemption from the sales and marketing prohibition. 132 The exemption based on size may
decrease the burden on small NRSROs. However, this amendment could create adverse effects
on competition as exempted NRSROs may be able to draw business through rating catering. In
particular, exempted NRSROs may be able to more readily produce conflicted and inflated
ratings 133 or generate a greater stream of revenue from selling rating and ancillary services than
non-exempted NRSROs. Reputation, which is an important disciplinary mechanism in this
industry, may mitigate this risk to a certain extent. 134

A number of credit rating agencies located in the United States have not registered as
NRSROs. 135 As U.S. regulatory agencies continue to remove references to NRSRO credit
ratings from the regulations they administer, market participants subject to these regulations may
choose to use unregistered credit rating agencies thereby diminishing the incentive to register as
an NRSRO. 136 On the other hand, users of credit ratings may choose to use NRSROs over
unregistered credit rating agencies because of the NRSRO registration and oversight program,
which is being enhanced by the amendments and new rules being adopted today.
To the extent that these amendments and new rules improve the quality of credit-related
information, they may have effects related to allocative efficiency and capital formation. As a
result of these amendments and new rules, users of credit ratings could make more efficient
investment decisions based on higher-quality information. Market efficiency also may improve
if credit ratings become more informative and the additional information is reflected in asset
prices. To the extent that the amendments and rules will be effective in enhancing the integrity
and quality of NRSRO credit ratings, users of these credit ratings may benefit from an enhanced
confidence in the quality of the creditworthiness assessments reflected in the credit ratings,
which may have positive effects on the willingness of investors to participate in the securities
markets and thereby enhance capital formation, as capital efficiently flows to more productive
uses. The benefits in terms of efficiency and capital formation arising from the rules enhancing
governance and the integrity of credit ratings are likely to be greater for asset-backed securities,
where the inherent conflict of interest in the issuer-pay model is more acute, and, as a result of

Amendments and Rules Enhancing Disclosure and
Transparency of Credit Ratings

The requirements in the amendments and new rules being adopted today that are
primarily designed to enhance disclosure should have economic benefits, relative to the baseline
that existed before the amendments and rules were adopted, in terms of promoting the
transparency of credit ratings and NRSRO activities and, therefore, NRSRO accountability. This
should benefit users of credit ratings, including investors. The amendments and rules also should
enhance disclosure requirements with respect to asset-backed securities for the benefit of users of
credit ratings, including investors in these securities.
The amendments significantly enhance the existing requirements for NRSROs to produce
and disclose performance statistics to make the disclosures more comparable across NRSROs
and easier for users of credit ratings and others to understand. 137 Similarly, the existing
requirements for NRSROs to disclose rating histories are being enhanced to make the histories
more complete in terms of the scope of credit ratings that must be included in the histories and
more robust in terms of the information that must be disclosed with each rating action. 138 To the
extent that the new disclosures facilitate the evaluation of the performance of an NRSRO’s credit
ratings and the comparison of rating performance across all NRSROs – including direct
comparisons of the rating history of the same obligor or instrument across two or more NRSROs
– the rules may benefit users of credit ratings, including investors. In particular, the enhanced
disclosure may allow them to better assess the reliability of credit ratings from different

49

NRSROs and, in the case of issuer-paid credit ratings or subscriber-paid credit ratings, make
more informed decisions regarding whether to hire, or subscribe to the credit ratings of, a
particular NRSRO.
There are new requirements applicable to NRSROs pursuant to which they must publish
on their Internet websites: (1) material changes to the procedures and methodologies, including
to qualitative models or quantitative inputs, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings, the
reason for the changes, and the likelihood the changes will result in changes to any current credit
ratings; and (2) notice of the existence of a significant error identified in a procedure or
methodology, including a qualitative or quantitative model, the NRSRO uses to determine credit
ratings that may result in a change to current credit ratings. 139 These requirements may benefit
users of NRSRO credit ratings in terms of their ability to evaluate the procedures and
methodologies used by an NRSRO to determine credit ratings. In this way, they also may
promote the NRSROs’ accountability to the market and the issuance of quality credit ratings.
There are new requirements applicable to NRSROs pursuant to which they must publish
two items when taking a rating action: (1) a form containing certain quantitative and qualitative
information about the credit rating that is the result or subject of the rating action; and (2) any
certification of a third-party due diligence provider relating to the credit rating. 140 The required
disclosures may be used by investors and other users of credit ratings to better understand credit
ratings issued by NRSROs. Specifically, the forms and certifications will provide incremental
information about how a credit rating was produced (for example, disclosure about assumptions,
limitations, information relied on, version of the procedure or methodology used, potential
conflicts of interest) and the information content of the credit rating. The information disclosed
139

These amendments are discussed below in section II.F.1. of this release.

140

These amendments are discussed below in section II.G. of this release.

50

in the form, including information about the limitations of the credit rating and information
regarding due diligence, may discourage undue reliance on credit ratings by investors and other
users of credit ratings in making investment and other credit-based decisions.
There is a new requirement applicable to issuers and underwriters of asset-backed
securities pursuant to which they must disclose the findings and conclusions of any third-party
due diligence report they obtain. 141 The rule applies to both registered and unregistered offerings
of asset-backed securities. Additionally, there is a new requirement applicable to providers of
third-party due diligence services with respect to asset-backed securities pursuant to which they
must provide a written certification to any NRSRO that is producing a credit rating with respect
to the asset-backed security. 142 The certification must disclose information about the due
diligence performed, including a summary of the findings and conclusions of the third party, and
identification of any relevant NRSRO due diligence criteria that the third party intended to meet
in performing the due diligence.
As discussed above, the amendments and new rules are intended to reduce asymmetric
information in the asset-backed security market. NRSROs producing credit ratings for assetbacked securities may benefit from receiving the information in the certification. The
certification also will be signed by an individual who is duly authorized by the third-party due
diligence provider to make such a certification, promoting confidence in the accuracy of the
information disclosed. Importantly, issuers and underwriters can no longer select what part of
this information to provide to NRSROs, reducing the possibility of less favorable information
being withheld from NRSROs and reducing the risk that the credit ratings will be based on
imperfect or incomplete information (to the extent the NRSROs use information about due
141

These amendments are discussed below in section II.H.1. of this release.

142

These amendments are discussed below in sections II.H.2. and II.H.3. of this release.

51

diligence in producing their credit ratings). Further, making this information available to all
NRSROs (rather than just the NRSROs hired to rate the asset-backed security) could promote the
issuance of more credit ratings for a given asset-backed security, including credit ratings that
provide a more diverse range of views on the creditworthiness of the security. Users of credit
ratings, including investors and other participants in the asset-backed securities markets, may
benefit both directly and indirectly from the disclosures made by issuers, underwriters, and
providers of third-party due diligence services. To the extent that findings and conclusions of all
third-party due diligence reports were not previously disclosed to these persons, the amendments
and new rules should enhance information available to the public.
Finally, there are new requirements pursuant to which NRSROs must use the
Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system to
electronically submit Form NRSRO and required exhibits to the form to the Commission.143
Having all information available in an electronic format in EDGAR will provide a centralized
location and should make the information and the history of that information more easily
accessible, comparable, and searchable to users of credit ratings, including investors.
There will be costs associated with the amendments and new rules being adopted today
that are related to enhanced disclosure and transparency. 144 These costs will be primarily
incurred by NRSROs, 145 issuers and underwriters of asset-backed securities, and third-party due
diligence providers. Initial and ongoing direct costs, including compliance costs, may vary
among the affected parties depending on their size and the complexity of their business activities

143

See section II.L. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the amendments).

144

A detailed analysis of the economic costs, including compliance costs that can potentially result from each
rule is presented in the focused economic analyses in section II of this release. See sections II.A.4., II.B.4.,
II.C.3., II.D.2., II.E.4., II.F.3., II.G.6., II.H.4., II.I.3., II.J.3., II.K.2., II.L.2., and II.M.5. of this release.

145

NRSROs may be able to pass some of the incremental costs to their clients.

52

(for example, number of credit ratings outstanding, number of analysts, number of classes of
credit ratings, number of years issuing credit ratings, and number of historical credit ratings).
Keeping all other factors constant, NRSROs operating according to a subscriber-pay model may
face greater losses in revenue from the sale of access to historical ratings data, as more of this
data becomes publicly available, since they are likely to be more dependent on this source of
revenue than NRSROs operating according to the issuer-pay model. A component of these costs
may also be fixed, affecting more significantly smaller NRSROs that may find it more difficult
to bear the costs. If NRSROs are not able to readily pass the overall additional costs to clients,
there may be adverse effects, especially on smaller NRSROs.
Similar to the amendments and new rules relating to governance, the amendments and
new rules relating to disclosure and transparency could reduce the number of credit rating
agencies registered with the Commission as NRSROs to the extent that current registrants
believe the cost of being registered and subject to these new requirements outweighs the benefit
of registration. In addition, the barriers to entry for credit rating agencies to register as NRSROs
may rise, especially for smaller credit rating agencies. NRSROs may have a reduced incentive to
register for a new class of credit ratings with adverse effects on competition in certain market
segments. Barriers to exit from registration as an NRSRO may lower due to the possible erosion
of profit margins, though an NRSRO’s decision to deregister from certain or all classes of credit
ratings may depend on whether users of credit ratings will favor NRSROs because of the
NRSRO registration and oversight program, which is being enhanced by the amendments and
new rules being adopted today. The risk for deregistration will likely be higher for smaller
NRSROs, given the fixed component of some compliance costs and the greater difficulty to pass
the increase in costs to their clients.

53

Also, the amendments and new rules may impact competition among third-party due
diligence providers. Although the Commission knows little about the characteristics of the
market for the services they provide, the certification requirement may increase the liability risk
for these providers, particularly for those who do not already bear expert liability under Rule
193. 146 If third-party due diligence providers are not able to charge more for performing the
asset review to account for the heightened risk of liability, some providers may exit the market or
some entities that otherwise would have entered the market may decide against doing so.
The amendments and new rules also may have positive effects on competition, efficiency
and capital formation. The enhanced standardization of the information content may facilitate
comparing performance statistics and rating histories across NRSROs. Clients of NRSROs (for
example, issuers, subscribers, and others) may use the performance statistics to inform their
hiring or subscribing decisions, increasingly promoting competition among NRSROs on the
basis of the quality of their credit ratings and the procedures and methodologies used to
determine credit ratings. To the extent that the adopted rules facilitate the external monitoring
and comparative analysis of NRSROs, they may allow users of credit ratings to develop more
refined views of NRSRO performance and thereby indirectly increase accountability and
encourage integrity in the production of credit ratings. This, in turn, may facilitate the ability of
NRSROs to establish and maintain reputations for issuing quality credit ratings to remain
competitive. More comparable performance data may also help relatively smaller and newer

146

See 17 CFR 230.193; 17 CFR 229.1111. Under Rule 193 and Item 1111 of Regulation AB, an issuer of a
registered asset-backed security is required to perform a review of the assets underlying the asset-backed
security and disclose the nature of the review. In meeting this requirement, an issuer may engage a third
party to perform the required review of the underlying assets. If the third party’s findings and conclusions
are to be attributed to it, the third-party must consent to being named in the issuer’s registration statement
as an “expert,” thus subjecting the third party to so-called “expert liability” under the Securities Act. If
third-party diligence providers are not subject to legal liability as experts, the issuer itself remains legally
accountable for the accuracy of the disclosures it makes to investors.

54

NRSROs, including subscriber-paid NRSROs, to attract attention to their rating performance,
enhancing their ability to develop a reputation for producing quality credit ratings. This may
allow them to better compete with more established competitors. Also, the ability of non-hired
NRSROs to obtain the information disclosed in the third-party due diligence certification may
provide them with an advantage in producing informative unsolicited credit ratings, relative to
unregistered credit rating agencies that cannot obtain this information.
The new disclosure requirements in the form and certifications that accompany a rating
action may reduce information asymmetries about how a credit rating was determined by
providing additional information about the rating process, such as assumptions, limitations,
version of the procedures or methodologies used, and, in the case of an asset-backed security, a
description of the findings and conclusions of a third-party due diligence provider, if such
services were employed. To the extent that the required disclosure does not diminish the content
and timeliness of the information conveyed with the rating actions, the enhanced information
may increase the ability of users of credit ratings to accurately interpret the information,
potentially resulting in more efficient investment decisions and higher overall market efficiency
to the benefit of those investors that use credit ratings. This, in turn, may increase investors’
participation in the securities markets with positive effects on capital formation. Because of the
higher degree of information asymmetry in the asset-backed security market, the benefits in
efficiency and capital formation resulting from the enhanced disclosure and transparency of
credit ratings are likely to be greater for these securities, with the result that investors may
become more willing to participate in this market.
II.

FINAL RULES AND RULE AMENDMENTS

55

As discussed in detail below, the Commission is adopting new rules and amendments to
existing rules to implement Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act and to enhance the
NRSRO registration and oversight program administered by the Commission. In designing rules
to implement Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission has taken into account
section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act. 147 This section provides, in pertinent part, that neither
the Commission nor any State (or political subdivision thereof) may regulate the substance of
credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any NRSRO determines credit
ratings. 148 One way the Commission has sought to reconcile the rulemaking mandated by the
Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, with the limitation in section 15E(c)(2) is to
model rule text closely on statutory text.
A.

INTERNAL CONTROL STRUCTURE

Section 932(a)(2)(B) of the Dodd-Frank Act added paragraph (3) to section 15E(c) of the
Exchange Act. 149 Section 15E(c)(3)(A) requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence
to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings (“internal control
structure”), taking into consideration such factors as the Commission may prescribe, by rule. 150
While section 15E(c)(3)(A) provides that the Commission “may” prescribe factors an NRSRO
would need to take into consideration when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and
documenting the internal control structure, the requirement that an NRSRO “establish, maintain,
enforce, and document an effective internal control structure” is self-executing. 151

Consequently, an NRSRO must adhere to this provision irrespective of whether the Commission
prescribes factors pursuant to section 15E(c)(3)(A).
Section 15E(c)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission “shall
prescribe” rules requiring each NRSRO to submit an annual internal controls report to the
Commission, which shall contain: (1) a description of the responsibility of the management of
the NRSRO in establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure; (2) an
assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure; and (3) the attestation of the
chief executive officer (“CEO”), or equivalent individual, of the NRSRO. 152
In the proposing release, the Commission: (1) deferred prescribing factors the NRSRO
must take into consideration in establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an
effective internal control structure; (2) proposed amending the NRSRO recordkeeping rule (Rule
17g-2) to require that the documentation of the internal control structure be subject to the rule’s
record retention requirements; and (3) proposed amending the NRSRO annual reporting rule
(Rule 17g-3) to require an NRSRO to file an unaudited annual internal controls report with the
Commission.153

Prescribing Factors

In the proposing release, the Commission stated that it was deferring prescribing factors
an NRSRO must take into consideration when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and
documenting an effective internal control structure to provide the Commission with an
opportunity – through the NRSRO examination process and the submission of annual reports by
the NRSROs on the effectiveness of their internal control structures – to review how NRSROs
have complied with the self-executing requirement in section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act

to establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure. 154 However,
the Commission sought comment on whether it would be appropriate as part of this rulemaking
to prescribe factors and on potential factors the Commission could prescribe. 155 In particular, the
Commission identified factors relating to: (1) the establishment of an internal control structure;
(2) the maintenance of an internal control structure; and (3) the enforcement of an internal
control structure. 156
In terms of establishing an internal control structure, the Commission requested comment
on the following factors:
•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a newly developed methodology or proposed
update to an in-use methodology for determining credit ratings is subject to an
appropriate review process (for example, by persons who are independent from the
persons that developed the methodology or methodology update) and to management
approval prior to the new or updated methodology being employed by the NRSRO to
determine credit ratings; 157

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a newly developed methodology or update to
an in-use methodology for determining credit ratings is disclosed to the public for
consultation prior to the new or updated methodology being employed by the NRSRO to
determine credit ratings, that the NRSRO makes comments received as part of the
consultation publicly available, and that the NRSRO considers the comments before
implementing the methodology;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that in-use methodologies for determining credit
ratings are periodically reviewed (for example, by persons who are independent from the
persons who developed and/or use the methodology) in order to analyze whether the
methodology should be updated;

Section 15E(t)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act contains a self-executing provision requiring that the board of
directors of the NRSRO shall “oversee” the “establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of policies and
procedures for determining credit ratings.” See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(t)(3)(A). At the same time, section 15E(r)
of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to adopt rules “to ensure that credit ratings are determined
using procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and models” that are
approved by the board of the NRSRO. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(r)(1)(A).

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that market participants have an opportunity to
provide comment on whether in-use methodologies for determining credit ratings should
be updated, that the NRSRO makes any such comments received publicly available, and
that the NRSRO considers the comments;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that newly developed or updated quantitative
models proposed to be incorporated into a credit rating methodology are evaluated and
validated prior to being put into use;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that quantitative models incorporated into in-use
credit rating methodologies are periodically reviewed and back-tested;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that an NRSRO engages in analysis before
commencing the rating of a class of obligors, securities, or money market instruments the
NRSRO has not previously rated to determine whether the NRSRO has sufficient
competency, access to necessary information, and resources to rate the type of obligor,
security, or money market instrument;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that an NRSRO engages in analysis before
commencing the rating of an “exotic” or “bespoke” type of obligor, security, or money
market instrument to review the feasibility of determining a credit rating;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that measures (for example, statistics) are used to
evaluate the performance of credit ratings as part of the review of in-use methodologies
for determining credit ratings to analyze whether the methodologies should be updated or
the work of the analysts employing the methodologies should be reviewed;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that, with respect to determining credit ratings,
the work and conclusions of the lead credit analyst developing an initial credit rating or
conducting surveillance on an existing credit rating is reviewed by other analysts,
supervisors, or senior managers before a rating action is formally taken (for example,
having the work reviewed through a rating committee process);

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a credit analyst documents the steps taken in
developing an initial credit rating or conducting surveillance on an existing credit rating
with sufficient detail to permit an after-the-fact review or internal audit of the rating file
to analyze whether the analyst adhered to the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies
for determining credit ratings; and

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO conducts periodic reviews or
internal audits of rating files to analyze whether analysts adhere to the NRSRO’s
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings. 158

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33422.

59

In terms of maintaining an internal control structure, the Commission requested comment
on the following factors:
•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO conducts periodic reviews of
whether it has devoted sufficient resources to implement and operate the documented
internal control structure as designed;

•

Controls reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO conducts periodic reviews or
ongoing monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of the internal control structure and
whether it should be updated; and

•

Controls designed to ensure that any identified deficiencies in the internal control
structure are assessed and addressed on a timely basis. 159
In terms of enforcing an internal control structure, the Commission requested comment

on the following factors:
•

Controls designed to ensure that additional training is provided or discipline taken with
respect to employees who fail to adhere to requirements imposed by the internal control
structure; and



Controls designed to ensure that a process is in place for employees to report failures to
adhere to the internal control structure. 160
In terms of documenting the internal control structure, the Commission asked for

comment on whether there should be a factor relating to the level of written detail about the
internal control structure that should be documented. 161
A number of commenters addressed whether the Commission should prescribe factors as
part of this rulemaking and, if so, the type of factors the Commission should prescribe. 162
NRSROs urged the Commission to defer rulemaking and stated that the Commission should not

prescribe factors. 163 For example, one NRSRO stated that the Commission should defer
rulemaking until it has the opportunity to determine through the examination process and its
review of the NRSROs’ annual reports the “best practices utilized” by NRSROs to comply with
the self-executing requirement in section 15E(c)(3)(A) and that the Commission’s “examination
feedback regarding best practices related to internal controls will be an important element for the
adequate design and monitoring of internal controls.” 164 Another NRSRO stated that it “strongly
agrees” with the Commission’s proposal to defer rulemaking but that, if the Commission
proceeds with rulemaking, it should “exercise caution” because attempting to create a "one-size
fits all" rule in “such a short timeframe could result in the creation of an anti-competitive
environment and the attendant unintended consequences.” 165 A third NRSRO stated that
“NRSROs should have the flexibility to implement whatever control structure suits their size and
particular business operations.” 166
In contrast, several other commenters stated that the Commission should not defer
rulemaking. 167 For example, one commenter stated that the Commission “already has significant
information about the weak internal controls at the NRSROs and has already identified a number
of factors critical to an effective internal control system” and that “[p]ostponing the issuance of
any standards will result in the NRSROs developing different internal control structures, making
oversight and the implementation of minimum standards more difficult, time consuming, and

impact on smaller NRSROs, whose internal control structure would be best served by designing and

expensive down the line.” 168 Another commenter stated that the proposed approach “will be
ineffective in reforming credit rating agency practices and will leave the Commission with little
if any ability to hold ratings agencies accountable if they adopt weak and ineffective controls.” 169
These commenters and others recommended that the Commission prescribe factors, 170 and one
of the commenters recommended that the Commission re-propose the rule to prescribe factors. 171

One commenter discussed factors that the commenter believed should be included in “a set of
mandatory minimum standards for an effective internal control system for credit ratings.” 172
Another commenter stated that “the criteria on which the Commission seeks comment are
precisely the sort of controls that ought to be in place if the system is operating effectively.” 173
A third commenter agreed that the rule should “incorporate all of these factors [as described in
the proposing release].” 174 Two commenters pointed to the internal control framework
developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 1992
as a model. 175 Two commenters stated that the rule should require that the documentation of the
internal control structure include specific elements, such as how the board of directors conducted
its oversight of the internal control structure. 176

The Commission believes it is critically important to investors and other users of credit
ratings that, as required by section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act, NRSROs establish,
maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure governing the
implementation of and adherence to their policies, procedures, and methodologies for
determining credit ratings. 177 The Commission agrees that the requirements established by the
NRSROs to address the internal control structure should “provide the companies’ management
the ability to effectively administer their internal compliance measures, and instill confidence in
their investors and the public that the companies in fact are achieving the objectives of their
internal control rules and, in so doing, promoting ratings that are high-quality, objective,
independent, reliable, and free from influence by any conflicts of interest.” 178 This is one of the
reasons that the Commission previously has expressed concerns about – and has taken action to
address – the integrity of policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings used
by certain NRSROs in light of the role these NRSROs played in determining credit ratings for
securities collateralized by or linked to subprime residential mortgages. 179

Moreover, the Commission staff conducts annual examinations of each NRSRO and
publishes a report summarizing the essential findings of the examinations, as required by section
15E(p)(3) of the Exchange Act. 180 The annual report attributes the essential findings, as

controls; the evidence obtained and conclusions reached during testing of the effectiveness of the internal
controls; material weaknesses identified and how they were remediated; how the board of directors
conducted its oversight; significant matters that arose in the design, operation, or monitoring of internal
controls and how they were resolved; and the basis for reports to the Commission on the effectiveness of
the internal control structure).

applicable, to the “smaller” NRSROs or “larger” NRSROs, and describes for the public the
nature and extent of the deficiencies cited. The Commission staff, as part of the annual
examination of each NRSRO, reviews whether the internal control structure of the NRSRO is
effective as required by section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act. 181
For example, in the annual report published in December 2013, the Commission staff
noted that all NRSROs had “added or improved internal controls over the rating process” since
the examinations began in 2010 and generally improved adherence to their rating policies and
procedures, which “appear[ed] to be attributable, in part, to improvements in the internal control
structure at NRSROs.” 182 However, in several instances the staff found that an NRSRO did not
follow its policies and procedures and the staff recommended that the NRSRO improve its
internal controls to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures. 183 In particular, the
Commission staff cited section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act in its report and stated that
many NRSROs relied on a testing or internal audit program as an internal supervisory control. 184
The staff then described certain weaknesses it found in those controls, and recommended that
those NRSROs improve and better document their testing and audit programs. 185
Deficiencies in the internal control structure found by the examination staff are brought
to the attention of the NRSRO, and the staff monitors whether and how those deficiencies are

governance of the NRSRO).

addressed. If warranted, the examination staff also can refer an NRSRO to the enforcement staff
for potential violations of section 15E(c)(3)(A).
Given the importance of the NRSROs’ internal control structures, the Commission
believes that an NRSRO should be required to consider the factors identified in the proposing
release when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal control
structure. The exercise of considering these factors will provide the NRSROs with an
opportunity to critically evaluate the effectiveness of their existing internal control structures and
new registrants a reference point for designing or modifying existing internal control structures
to comply with the statutory requirement. This should improve the overall effectiveness of the
internal control structures of the NRSROs.
Consequently, the Commission is adding paragraph (d) to new Rule 17g-8 to provide that
an NRSRO must consider certain factors when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, or
documenting an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and
adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings pursuant to
section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Act. 186 The factors identified in this paragraph are the same factors
the Commission identified in the proposing release. 187 Paragraph (d)(1) identifies the factors
relating to establishing an effective internal control structure, paragraph (d)(2) identifies the
factors relating to maintaining an effective internal control structure, and paragraph (d)(3)
identifies the factors relating to enforcing an effective internal control structure. 188
In considering a given factor, an NRSRO should determine whether it would be
appropriate for the firm’s internal control structure. Moreover, paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and

(d)(3) contain a “catchall” provision that provides that the NRSRO must consider any other
controls necessary to establish, maintain, or enforce an effective internal control structure taking
into consideration the nature of the business of the NRSRO, including its size, activities,
organizational structure, and business model. The Commission is including the catchall
provisions because the factors identified in paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 may not be
comprehensive or sufficient for the circumstances of a particular NRSRO. An NRSRO should
not treat them as a checklist or “safe harbor” that allows the firm to conclude that it has
established, maintained, enforced, and documented an effective internal control structure.
Paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 17g-8 addresses the documentation of the internal control
structure. 189 In the proposing release, the Commission did not identify a factor relating to this
provision of the statute. 190 Consequently, paragraph (d)(4) does not identify a specific factor. 191
Instead, the paragraph provides – consistent with the catchall provisions in paragraphs (d)(1)
through (d)(3) – that an NRSRO must take into consideration any controls necessary to
document an effective internal control structure taking into consideration the nature of the
business of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization, including its size, activities,
organizational structure, and business model. 192
Finally, in adopting the final rule, the Commission has taken into account comments from
NRSROs that it should not prescribe factors or “exercise caution” in doing so because “NRSROs
should have the flexibility to implement whatever control structure suits their size and particular
business operations” 193 and attempting to create a "one-size fits all" rule in “could result in the

66

creation of an anti-competitive environment and the attendant unintended consequences.” 194 In
particular, the Commission notes that, while the Commission is prescribing factors an NRSRO
must consider, it is not mandating that a specific factor be implemented. Consequently, while
NRSROs must consider the factors identified by the Commission, they can tailor their internal
control structures to their particular circumstances.
2.

Amendment to Rule 17g-2

Section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act contains a self-executing provision that
requires an NRSRO, among other things, to document its internal control structure. 195 However,
the statute does not prescribe how an NRSRO must maintain this record. For example, the
statute does not prescribe how long the record must be retained or the manner in which it must be
maintained. Consequently, the Commission proposed adding paragraph (b)(12) to Rule 17g-2 to
identify the internal control structure an NRSRO must document pursuant to 15E(c)(3)(A) of the
Exchange Act as a record that must be retained. 196 As a result, the various retention and
production requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of Rule 17g-2 would apply to the
record documenting the internal control structure. 197
Two commenters expressed support for the proposal, 198 whereas three other commenters
raised concerns which are discussed below. 199 The Commission is adding paragraph (b)(12) to

194

See A.M. Best Letter (“prescribing specific factors implies that all NRSROs are the same, which they are
not. NRSROs vary in size, ownership, business plans, and management. ‘Specific factors’ would

impact on smaller NRSROs, whose internal control structure would be best served by designing and

67

Rule 17g-2 as proposed. 200 Retention of the record will provide a means for the Commission to
monitor the NRSROs’ compliance with 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act.
In addition, the Commission is amending paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2. Prior to today’s
amendments, this paragraph provided that the records required to be retained under paragraphs
(a) and (b) of Rule 17g-2 must be retained for three years after the date the record is made or
received. The modification clarifies that the records documenting the internal control structure,
the policies and procedures discussed in sections II.C., II.F., and II.J. of this release, and the
standards discussed in section II.I. of this release must all be retained until three years after the
record is replaced with an updated record (that is, when a control, policy, procedure, or standard
documented in one of these records is replaced with a new control, policy, procedure, or
standard). 201
The reason for this clarifying amendment is that the text of paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2
prior to today’s amendment was intended to address records that generally contain historical
information. For example, the rule requires the retention of records reflecting entries to and
balances in all general ledger accounts, records indicating the identity of any credit analyst(s)
that participated in determining a credit rating, credit analysis reports, credit assessment reports,
and private credit rating reports. 202 The intent of the three-year record retention requirement is to
preserve these records documenting historical information for three years after the fact in order
to allow Commission examiners the opportunity to review the past activities of the NRSRO as
200

See paragraph (b)(12) of Rule 17g-2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires an NRSRO to make
and keep such records, and make and disseminate such reports, as the Commission prescribes by rule as
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78q(a)(1).

201

See paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 (providing that the records required to be retained pursuant to paragraphs
(a) and (b) of the rule must be retained for three years after the date the record is made or received, except
that a record identified in paragraph (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(14), or (b)(15) of the rule must be retained
until three years after the date the record is replaced with an updated record).

reflected in these records. It also provides the NRSRO with records that can be used in
connection with internal or third-party audits and for tracking past activities.
The Commission intended the three-year record retention provision in paragraph (c) of
Rule 17g-2 as applied to the documentation of the internal control structure, the policies and
procedures, and the standards to also preserve historical information for three years after the fact
to facilitate Commission examinations and NRSRO internal or third party audits of past
activities. However, the record reflects current rather than historical information until there is an
update of the internal control structure, policies and procedures, or standards documented in the
record (that is, the record reflects the internal controls, policies and procedures, or standards, as
applicable, that govern the NRSRO’s conduct now and in the future). Consequently, because
paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 – prior to today’s amendments – required a record “to be retained
for three years after the date the record is made or received,” this provision as applied to the
documentation of the internal control structure, policies and procedures, and standards would be
ambiguous as to whether the record must be retained for three years after the information
reflected in the record is no longer current.
For example, section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act requires an NRSRO to document
its internal control structure. 203 This means that at all times the NRSRO must document the
internal control structure that is in effect and, consequently, if a given version of an internal
control structure is in effect for more than three years, the NRSRO must continue to maintain the
record documenting the internal control structure even though three years have elapsed since the
record was made. The clarifying text being added to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 addresses an
ambiguity in the rule text. This ambiguity could be read to establish a three-year retention period

203

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(3)(A).

69

that is largely meaningless and is inconsistent with the Commission’s intent that these records be
retained for three years after the information in the record is no longer current. 204 Specifically,
without the clarifying amendment, paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 could be read to provide that the
three-year retention period begins to run at the time the internal control structure was first
documented. Under this reading, the rule would be redundant because it would prescribe a
retention period that is already addressed by the self-executing requirement in section
15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act (that an NRSRO must document its internal control structure).
In other words, the statutory requirement to document the internal control structure acts as a
retention requirement for as long as the current version of the internal control structure is in
effect. Further, under this reading of the rule, if an internal control structure was in effect for
three or more years, an NRSRO could discard the record documenting the previous internal
control structure as soon as it is replaced with an updated record documenting the revised
internal control structure (as it would have retained the previous record of the internal control
structure for three or more years). This could prevent the Commission from reviewing whether
the NRSRO adhered to its previous internal control structure, as examinations generally review
past activities. The appropriate and intended retention period is until three years after the
internal control structure is updated. As a result, the documentation recording the current
internal control structure and the documentation recording any prior versions of the internal
control structure that were updated within three years will be available to Commission
examiners. This will create an audit trail between prior versions of the internal control structure
and the existing internal control structure. For these reasons, the Commission is amending
paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 to make clear that the records documenting the internal control
204

See paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 (providing that the records must be retained until three years after the date
the record is replaced with an updated record).

70

structure, the policies and procedures, and the standards must be retained until three years after
the date the record is replaced with an updated record. 205
One commenter stated that a three-year retention period is “insufficient,” since “the
effects of a credit rating decision may not arise until after that retention period expires.” 206 The
Commission believes the three year retention period is sufficient. First, as noted above, an
NRSRO must maintain a record documenting its existing internal control structure for as long as
the internal control structure is in effect and for an additional three years after the record is
replaced with an updated record documenting the internal control structure. Second, the
Commission staff performs an annual examination of each NRSRO. Consequently, the record
documenting an internal control structure that is no longer in effect will be available for several
exam cycles.
Another commenter suggested requiring that documentation be made available to the
Commission “regardless of where the credit rating is produced.” 207 The Commission notes that
under the rules, regardless of where a credit rating is produced, an NRSRO must document its
internal control structure and produce to Commission staff the records documenting both its

within the three-year retention period. 208
A third commenter stated that the requirement to document internal controls is
burdensome, particularly for smaller NRSROs, and argued that documenting policies and

section 15E(c)(3)(A) – not Rule 17g-2 – requires an NRSRO to document its internal control
structure. 210 The amendment to Rule 17g-2 establishes retention requirements for this
documentation.

Amendments to Rule 17g-3

Section 15E(c)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall prescribe
rules requiring an NRSRO to submit an annual internal controls report to the Commission, which
must contain: (1) a description of the responsibility of management in establishing and
maintaining an effective internal control structure; (2) an assessment of the effectiveness of the
internal control structure; and (3) the attestation of the CEO or equivalent individual. 211
The Commission proposed amending Rule 17g-3 to implement the rulemaking mandated
by section 15E(c)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act. 212 Rule 17g-3 requires an NRSRO to furnish
annual reports to the Commission.213 In particular, before today’s amendments, paragraph (a) of

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33423-33425; 15 U.S.C. 78o7(c)(3)(B)(i) through (iii). In addition, as a technical amendment, the Commission proposed to amend the
title of Rule 17g-3 to replace the words “financial reports” with the words “financial and other reports.”
Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33424, n.25. The Commission stated that
the report identified in paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17g-3, the proposed internal control report that would be
required under paragraph (a)(7), and the compliance report that would be required under paragraph (a)(8)
(which is discussed below in section II.K. of this release) are not financial in nature. Id. The Commission
also proposed adding the word “filed” in the title of Rule 17g-3 to conform to amendments the Dodd-Frank
Act made to section 15E of the Exchange Act. See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 932(a).

213

See 17 CFR 240.17g-3.

72

Rule 17g-3 required an NRSRO to furnish five or, in some cases, six separate reports within
ninety days after the end of the NRSRO’s fiscal year and identified the reports that must be
furnished. 214 The first report containing the NRSRO’s financial statements must be audited; the
remaining reports on revenues and other matters may be unaudited. 215 Before today’s
amendments, paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3 provided that the NRSRO must attach to the reports a
signed statement by a duly authorized person that the person has responsibility for the reports
and, to the best knowledge of the person, the reports fairly present, in all material respects, the
information contained in the reports. 216
The proposed amendments would add paragraph (a)(7) to Rule 17g-3 to require an
NRSRO to file an additional report – which would be unaudited – with its annual submission of
reports pursuant to Rule 17g-3. 217 The proposed rule text describing the report that would need
to be filed closely mirrored the statutory text. 218 In particular, proposed paragraph (a)(7) would
have required that the internal controls report contain: (1) a description of the responsibility of
management in establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure; and (2) an
assessment by management of the effectiveness of the internal control structure. 219
Section 15E(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the Exchange Act provides that the annual internal controls
report must contain an attestation of the NRSRO’s CEO or equivalent individual. 220

Accordingly, the Commission proposed amending paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3 to require that the
NRSRO attach to the report a signed statement by the CEO or, if the firm does not have a CEO,
an individual performing similar functions. 221
The Commission is adding paragraphs (a)(7) and (b)(2) to Rule 17g-3 with modifications
from the proposal in response to comments. 222 As discussed below, the modifications to the text
of paragraph (a)(7) are designed to provide more guidance to NRSROs on the information that
must be included in the report compared to the proposed rule text, which – as noted above –
closely mirrored the statutory text.
Paragraph (a)(7) – as proposed and adopted – requires an NRSRO to include in the report
a description of the responsibility of management in establishing and maintaining an effective
internal control structure. 223 This rule text largely mirrors the statutory text. 224 A number of
commenters addressed the level of management that should have primary responsibility for
establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure and for assessing its
effectiveness. 225 An NRSRO stated that the CEO (or equivalent) and other management,
221

See paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76
FR at 33539. In particular, the Commission proposed re-organizing paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3 into
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2). As proposed, paragraph (b)(1) would contain the current requirement that the
NRSRO must attach to each of the annual reports required pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) a
signed statement by a duly authorized person associated with the NRSRO stating that the person has
responsibility for the financial reports and, to the best knowledge of the person, the reports fairly present, in
all material respects, the information required to be contained in the reports. As proposed, paragraph (b)(2)
of Rule 17g-3 would require that the NRSRO attach to the report filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) a signed
statement by the CEO of the NRSRO or, if the NRSRO does not have a CEO, an individual performing
similar functions, stating that the CEO or individual has responsibility for the report and, to the best
knowledge of the CEO or other individual, the report fairly presents, in all material respects, a description
of the responsibility of management in establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure
and an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure.

222

See paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3. The amendments to Rule 17g-3 also replace the phrase “financial
reports” with the phrase “financial and other reports” and replace the phrase “to be furnished” with the
phrase “to be filed or furnished.” These amendments are being adopted as proposed.

supervisory, and compliance personnel affiliated with the NRSRO should be responsible for
designing the structure, and that the board of directors should oversee the structure. 226 Two
other commenters stated that the board of directors should oversee the structure. 227 An NRSRO
stated that the wording in the proposed rule was reasonable, but that the Commission should
refrain from specifying which level of management should be responsible for establishing and
maintaining the system and that this determination “is best left to each NRSRO based upon its
business needs and organization.” 228 Similarly, another NRSRO stated that management and
board oversight of the internal control structure will vary greatly between each NRSRO and,
therefore, such determinations should be left to each NRSRO. 229 On the other hand, a
commenter suggested that management should have no part in the establishment or maintenance
of an internal control structure, and that a committee of analysts should assess the effectiveness
of the NRSRO’s internal control structure. 230
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that section 15E(t)(3)(C) of the
Exchange Act prescribes a self-executing requirement that the board of directors of the NRSRO
shall “oversee” the “effectiveness of the internal control system with respect to the policies and
procedures for determining credit ratings.” 231 Moreover, as discussed above, the self-executing
provision in section 15E(c)(3)(A) requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and

See Harrington Letter (suggesting the formation of a “Committee Assessment Function” that would be
“devoted solely to evaluating the committee performance over the course of a year of all members

with sole responsibility for this function”).

231

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(t)(3)(A).

document an effective internal control structure. 232 Further, section 15E(c)(3)(B) of the
Exchange Act refers, in pertinent part, to “a description of the responsibility of the management
of the [NRSRO] in establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure.” 233
Moreover, this section of the statute also provides that the annual internal controls report – which
must include an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure – must contain
an attestation of the NRSRO’s CEO or equivalent individual. 234 Consequently, a reasonable
interpretation of these statutory provisions is that they allocate responsibility to the NRSRO’s
board to “oversee” the effectiveness of the internal control structure and responsibility to the
NRSRO’s management to establish, maintain, enforce, and document the internal control
structure and to report annually on its effectiveness. This interpretation also is consistent with
the Commission’s understanding of how the responsibilities of a firm’s board and management
generally are allocated.
While it is the responsibility of management to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document the internal control structure, in carrying out this responsibility management could, as
a matter of good practice, consider the extent to which other persons within the NRSRO should
be involved. 235 For example, management could seek input from persons within the NRSRO
that carry out the day-to-day functions related to governing the implementation of and adherence
to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings. This could include
input from persons responsible for determining credit ratings, developing rating methodologies,
and reviewing and monitoring the NRSRO’s compliance with its policies, procedures, and

76

methodologies. In addition, establishing a mechanism for persons within the NRSRO to report,
on a confidential basis if they choose, directly to the board of directors any material weaknesses
in the NRSRO’s internal control structure could be a useful check on management’s annual
assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and could assist the board in its
responsibility to oversee the effectiveness of the internal control structure. Finally, an NRSRO
could consider developing procedures to identify and address internal conflicts of interest that
potentially could prevent an independent, impartial, and unbiased assessment of the effectiveness
of the internal control structure. This could promote more accurate reporting by the NRSRO on
the internal control structure.
In addition to the description of the responsibility of management in establishing and
maintaining an effective internal control structure, the proposal required that the internal controls
report include “an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the internal control
structure.” 236 As discussed in more detail below, several commenters stated that the
Commission should strengthen the reporting requirement in the rule relating to the assessment of
the effectiveness of the internal control structure. 237
The Commission is persuaded that the proposal should be modified to provide more
clarity on the information that must be reported in the internal controls report. In particular,
paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3, as adopted, requires that the internal controls report include (in

236

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33539. This provision of the
proposed amendment largely mirrored the statutory text. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(3)(B)(ii).

237

See AFSCME Letter; CFA/AFR Letter. These two commenters stated that the rule should require
reporting on: (1) the period of time to which management's assessment relates, which should be the entire
year; (2) the benchmark or framework used in assessing internal controls, as well as the definition of
internal control used; (3) the statement that the board of directors is responsible for overseeing the system
of internal controls; (4) if a material weakness was detected during the year, a description of that material
weakness and whether it has been remediated (and how) as of the end of that year; and (5) non-compliance
with applicable laws and regulations that have been identified, consistent with the Yellow Books standard
of the General Accounting Office (“GAO”).

77

addition to a description of the responsibility of management in establishing and maintaining an
effective internal control structure): (1) a description of each material weakness in the internal
control structure identified during the fiscal year, if any, and a description, if applicable, of how
each identified material weakness was addressed; and (2) a statement as to whether the internal
control structure was effective as of the end of the fiscal year. 238 Consequently, the final
amendment provides more specificity as to the information that must be included in the internal
controls report in terms of assessing the effectiveness of the NRSRO’s internal control
structure. 239
Further, in response to comments that the rule should specify that the assessment covers
the entire year, the Commission has made several modifications to the proposal. 240 Specifically,
the prefatory text of paragraph (a)(7)(i) of Rule 17g-3, as amended, provides that the internal
controls report must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness during the fiscal
year of the internal control structure. 241 The amendment further requires that the report must
include a description of each material weakness in the internal control structure identified during
the fiscal year, if any, and a description, if applicable, of how each identified material weakness
was addressed. 242 Consequently, the reporting relating to material weaknesses must cover the
entire fiscal year. The amendment also requires that the internal controls report contain a
statement as to whether the internal control structure was effective as of the end of the fiscal
238

See paragraph (a)(7)(i) of Rule 17g-3.

239

See paragraphs (a)(7)(i)(B) and (C) of Rule 17g-3. As discussed above, the proposal would have required
the report to include an “assessment by management of the effectiveness of the internal control report.”
See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33539. This more general
description of what must be contained in the internal controls report is being moved to the prefatory text of
paragraph (a)(7)(i) of Rule 17g-3.

year. 243 Thus, this statement in the report relates to a point in time: the fiscal year end.
However, the assessment of whether the internal control structure is effective as of the fiscal year
end will depend on how the NRSRO addressed any material weaknesses identified during the
fiscal year. 244
Commenters also addressed how to assess the internal control structure. One commenter
pointed to the internal control framework developed by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission in 1992 as a model. 245 Another
commenter stated that the Commission should establish a framework against which the internal
controls of an NRSRO can be measured that would identify the objectives of the controls, set
forth mandatory minimum components, and specify how a material weakness would be
handled. 246 Some commenters suggested that the Commission clarify how an NRSRO should
assess whether its internal control structure is effective. 247 One of these commenters suggested
the Commission lay out a basic definition of internal control and the objectives the internal
controls are designed to achieve but did not provide a suggested definition. 248 An NRSRO
suggested that the Commission clarify that “an ‘effective’ internal control structure is one that is
‘reasonably designed’ to achieve its purposes.” 249 In contrast, another NRSRO stated that the
proposed reporting requirement is “sufficiently explicit” and that “additional guidance is not
243

See paragraph (a)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 17g-3 (emphasis added).

244

As discussed below, paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of Rule 17g-3 provides that management is not permitted to
conclude that the internal control structure was effective as of the end of the fiscal year if there were one or
more material weaknesses in the internal control structure as of the end of the fiscal year.

management will report).

needed.” 250 This commenter added that each NRSRO operates in its own unique way and that
prescribing more detailed rules “may not be appropriate for every NRSRO in every situation.” 251
The Commission agrees that providing more clarity as to when management of the
NRSRO is not permitted to conclude that its internal control structure is effective would
strengthen the requirement and provide greater certainty to NRSROs in terms of how to assess
the effectiveness of the internal control structure. 252 The Commission therefore is modifying the
proposal to add a provision specifying when the NRSRO is not permitted to conclude that its
internal control structure is effective. 253 In particular, the final amendment provides that
management of the NRSRO is not permitted to conclude that the internal control structure of the
NRSRO was effective as of the end of the fiscal year if there were one or more material
weaknesses in the internal control structure as of the end of the fiscal year. 254
Commenters suggested several definitions of the term material weakness. For example,
one commenter suggested that material weakness be defined as a “serious deficiency that would
prevent or in fact did prevent the internal controls from achieving their objective.” 255 Another
commenter described a material weakness as “a serious deficiency in an internal control that
would prevent it from achieving its objective.” 256 Similarly, a third commenter stated that a

252

See, e.g., CFA/AFR Letter; DBRS Letter. The Commission provided such guidance when it recently
adopted a new reporting requirement for broker-dealers pursuant to which certain types of broker-dealers
must file a compliance report that contains, among other statements, a statement as to whether the brokerdealer’s internal control over compliance with certain rules was effective. See Broker-Dealer Reports,
Exchange Act Release No. 70073 (July 30, 2013), 78 FR 51910, 51916-51920 (Aug. 21, 2013). See also
17 CFR 240.17a-5(d)(3). The reporting requirement contains provisions prescribing when a broker-dealer
is not permitted to conclude that its internal control over compliance with these rules was effective.

definition of material weakness should be one “which clearly sets out what would be a serious
deficiency in internal controls that would prevent the internal controls from achieving their
objective.” 257 An NRSRO requested that the Commission provide guidance as to what
constitutes a material weakness and suggested that a material weakness be defined as a
“deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls where it is more likely than not
that the integrity of the rating process will be compromised by the failure to follow the NRSRO’s
policies, procedures, and methodologies.” 258 This commenter also stated that it believed that
one of the objectives of the internal control structure is to “provide reasonable assurance
regarding the prevention or timely detection of actions that could have a material effect on the
integrity of credit ratings.” 259 On the other hand, another NRSRO stated that the Commission
should allow NRSROs to define material weakness and other terms. 260
The Commission is persuaded that including a description of a material weakness in
paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 will strengthen the reporting requirement and provide greater
certainty to NRSROs in terms of how to assess the effectiveness of the internal control structure.
Consequently, the paragraph, as adopted, includes a description of when a material weakness
exists.261 This description is based, in part, on suggestions by commenters and on recent
amendments to the broker-dealer reporting rule. 262 The description of material weakness in the

257

See Morningstar Letter (also stating that, “[t]o the extent the CEO’s report requires a discussion of internal

rule incorporates the concept of a deficiency in the internal control structure of the NRSRO. 263
Consequently, paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 also includes a description of when a deficiency in
the internal control structure exists. 264 Under the requirements of the paragraph, the first step is
to determine whether there are deficiencies in the internal control structure. If so, the second
step is to determine whether a material weakness exists in light of the identified deficiencies.
The description in paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 of when a deficiency exists is based on
the control objectives set forth in section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act. 265 This selfexecuting provision specifies that the internal control structure must effectively govern the
implementation of and adherence to the NRSRO’s policies, procedures, and methodologies for
determining credit ratings. In other words, the controls must be designed to achieve the
following objectives: (1) that the NRSRO implements policies, procedures, and methodologies
for determining credit ratings in accordance with its policies and procedures; and (2) that the
NRSRO determines credit ratings in accordance with its policies, procedures, and methodologies
for determining credit ratings. Given these control objectives, the paragraph provides that a
deficiency in the internal control structure exists when the design or operation of a control does
not allow management or employees of the NRSRO, in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions, to prevent or detect a failure of the NRSRO to: (1) implement a policy,
procedure, or methodology for determining credit ratings in accordance with its policies and
procedures; or (2) adhere to an implemented policy, procedure, or methodology for determining
credit ratings. 266
263

See paragraph (a)(7)(iv) of Rule 17g-3.

264

See paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of Rule 17g-3.

265

See 15 U.S.C. 78-o7(c)(3)(A) (requiring that the internal control structure govern the “implementation of
and adherence to [the NRSRO’s] policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings”).

266

See paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of Rule 17g-3.

82

The existence of a deficiency in the internal control structure, however, does not
necessarily mean that a material weakness exists. Even a well-designed internal control structure
cannot guarantee that a deficiency will never occur. Therefore, paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3
provides that a material weakness exists if a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in the
design or operation of the internal control structure creates a reasonable possibility that a failure
identified in the description of deficiency (that is, a failure of the NRSRO to implement a policy,
procedure, or methodology for determining credit ratings in accordance with its policies and
procedures or to adhere to a policy, procedure, or methodology for determining credit ratings)
that is material will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 267
In the proposing release, the Commission asked whether the internal controls report
should be made public. 268 One commenter stated that the internal controls report should be made
publicly available. 269 The commenter stated that making the report public would enable users of
credit ratings “to evaluate the effectiveness of [the] rating agency’s internal control structure and
consider what impact, if any, it may have on the quality of the credit ratings the NRSRO
produces.” 270 On the other hand, three commenters – all NRSROs – stated that the report should
be kept confidential (as are the other reports submitted to the Commission under Rule 17g-3). 271
One NRSRO stated that publicizing the reports could make them less informative and more
defensive in nature, limiting their effectiveness. 272 A second NRSRO stated that “[m]anagement

control structure” and “[s]ince board oversight will be promoted by open and free dialogue with
management, the Commission should not impede such communication when imposing
requirements that make some or all parts of such management reports publicly available.” 273 A
third NRSRO stated that the reports may contain proprietary or confidential information
pertaining to the activities of the NRSRO. 274
The Commission is adopting the amendment as proposed and, therefore, is not requiring
that the internal controls report be made public. The final amendment is intended to assist the
Commission in examining and monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control structures of
NRSROs and how the structures evolve and improve over time. 275 Making the reports public –
as suggested by one commenter – could cause NRSROs to make them less detailed and
candid. 276 In appropriate cases, if an NRSRO fails to establish, maintain, enforce, and document
an effective internal control structure, the Commission could institute enforcement proceedings,
at which point the allegations related to the internal control structure would be a matter of public
record.
One commenter suggested the report be subjected to a third-party audit attesting to the
report’s reliability. 277 As stated above, the final amendment does not require that the internal
controls report be made public. Consequently, the report is not a public document that will be

relied upon by investors and other users of credit ratings. Rather, it is a non-public report that
will be used by Commission examiners as part of their monitoring of NRSROs’ compliance with
the requirement in section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document an effective internal control structure. The Commission has taken these factors into
consideration in balancing the benefits of having the internal controls report audited by a third
party and the costs of such a requirement. The Commission examines each of the ten NRSROs
currently registered with the Commission annually. At this time, the Commission believes that
the annual examinations by the Commission staff will provide a sufficient means for reviewing
the accuracy of the internal controls reports filed by the NRSROs.
In order to implement section 15E(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the Exchange Act, the Commission is
adopting the amendment to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3 with modifications to correspond to the
modifications to paragraph (a)(7) discussed above. 278 Specifically, as proposed, paragraph (b)(2)
of Rule 17g-3 would require that the NRSRO attach to the internal controls report filed pursuant
to paragraph (a)(7) a signed statement by the CEO of the NRSRO or, if the NRSRO does not
have a CEO, an individual performing similar functions, stating, in pertinent part, that the report
fairly presents, in all material respects, a description of the responsibility of management in
establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure and an assessment of the
effectiveness of the internal control structure. 279 As discussed above, under the final
amendments, paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 provides that the report must contain a description
of each material weakness in the internal control structure identified during the fiscal year, if
any, and a description, if applicable, of how each material weakness was addressed, and an
278

See paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-3. See also 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(3)(B)(iii) (providing, in pertinent part,
that the Commission shall prescribe rules requiring each NRSRO to submit to the Commission an internal
controls report, which shall contain the attestation of the CEO, or equivalent individual, of the NRSRO).

assessment by management of the effectiveness of the internal control structure as of the end of
the fiscal year. 280 Consequently, under the final amendments, paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-3
provides that the CEO or individual performing similar functions must state, in pertinent part,
that the internal controls report fairly presents, in all material respects: an assessment by
management of the effectiveness of the internal control structure during the fiscal year that
includes a description of the responsibility of management in establishing and maintaining an
effective internal control structure; a description of each material weakness in the internal control
structure identified during the fiscal year, if any; a description, if applicable, of how each
identified material weakness was addressed; and an assessment by management of the
effectiveness of the internal control structure as of the end of the fiscal year. 281

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the specific amendments
relating to reporting on internal control structures. 282 The baseline that existed before today’s
amendments was one in which NRSROs must establish, maintain, enforce, and document an
effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to their
methodologies for determining credit ratings. 283 In addition, section 15E(t)(3)(C) of the
Exchange Act requires the board of directors of the NRSRO to “oversee” the “effectiveness of
the internal control system with respect to policies and procedures for determining credit

280

See paragraph (a)(7)(i) of Rule 17g-3.

See paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-3.

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may
derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today.

86

ratings.” 284 However, before today’s amendments, there were no requirements addressing: (1)
the factors an NRSRO must consider when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and
documenting an internal control structure; and (2) the retention of the records documenting the
NRSRO’s internal control structure. In addition, there were no requirements to file an annual
internal controls report with the Commission attested to by the NRSRO’s CEO or equivalent
individual describing the responsibility of the management of the NRSRO in establishing and
maintaining an effective internal control structure and containing an assessment of the
effectiveness of the internal control structure.
Relative to the baseline, paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 requiring an NRSRO to consider
certain factors when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an internal control
should result in benefits. As noted above, the exercise of considering these factors will provide
the NRSROs with an opportunity to critically evaluate the effectiveness of their existing internal
control structures and new registrants a reference point for designing or modifying existing
internal control structures to comply with the statutory requirement to establish, maintain,
enforce, and document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of
and adherence to their methodologies for determining credit ratings. 285 This should improve the
overall effectiveness of the internal control structures of the NRSROs.
Relative to this baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-2 requiring an NRSRO to retain a
record documenting its internal control structure should result in benefits. Recordkeeping rules
such as Rule 17g-2 are integral to the Commission’s investor protection function because the
preserved records are the primary means of monitoring compliance with applicable securities

284

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(t)(3)(C).

285

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(3)(A).

87

laws. 286 Rule 17g–2 is designed to ensure that an NRSRO makes and retains records that will
assist the Commission’s staff in monitoring, through its examination program, whether an
NRSRO is complying with applicable securities laws, including the provisions of section 15E of
the Exchange Act and the rules adopted under section 15E. The amendments to Rule 17g-2 are
designed to assist the Commission staff in monitoring an NRSRO’s compliance with the
requirement in section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence
to its policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings.
Relative to the baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-3 requiring NRSROs to file an
internal controls report with the Commission should result in benefits. First, the annual report
will facilitate the Commission’s oversight of NRSROs by assisting the Commission in
monitoring an NRSRO’s compliance with the requirement in section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the
Exchange Act to establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control
structure governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and
methodologies for determining credit ratings. Compliance with the requirement to file the
internal controls report may enhance the integrity of credit ratings by increasing the likelihood
that NRSROs will adhere to their procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings.
Second, the requirement that an NRSRO describe in the report any material weaknesses
identified during the fiscal year and how any identified material weakness was addressed may
incentivize an NRSRO to more closely monitor and make appropriate improvements to its
internal control structure, which could improve the integrity and quality of its credit ratings. The

286

Organizations, 72 FR at 33582.

88

requirements also could provide accountability for effective governance by the NRSRO’s board
and management, which also may improve the integrity of credit ratings.
Third, the requirement that the CEO or a person performing similar functions attest to the
report should help to ensure that the report fairly presents the assessment by management of the
effectiveness of the internal control structure. It also should promote greater focus within an
NRSRO on establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal control
structure, given the involvement of senior level management in attesting to the reported
information. Further, because the person attesting to the report must represent that the person
has responsibility for the report, there will be senior level accountability for the accuracy and
completeness of the report, which also should promote greater focus within an NRSRO on
establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal control structure.
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 and the amendments to Rules 17g-3 and 17g-2 should
promote the objective of ensuring that NRSROs comply with section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the
Exchange Act (that is, establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control
structure). 287 This should mitigate the risk that an NRSRO may use a rating methodology that
has not been implemented in accordance with its policies and procedures or that it issues a credit
rating that was not determined in accordance with its policies, procedures, and methodologies for
determining credit ratings. Again, the integrity and quality of credit ratings could increase as a
result.
With respect to prescribing factors, commenters stated, in response to a question in the
proposing release, that the Commission should not prescribe factors for an internal control

287

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(3)(A).

89

structure because this would place a heavy burden on small NRSROs.288 The Commission
believes the manner in which it has prescribed factors will address these concerns and, relative to
the baseline, paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 should not result in costs. NRSROs already are
required to establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure
governing the implementation of and adherence to their methodologies for determining credit
ratings. 289 In doing so, an NRSRO already must consider the types of controls that would be
necessary to meet this statutory requirement. Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 provides reference
points for engaging in this exercise and may facilitate and focus the process. Moreover, while
the Commission is prescribing factors an NRSRO must consider, it is not mandating that a
specific factor be implemented. Consequently, while NRSROs must consider the factors
identified by the Commission, they can tailor and scale their internal control structures to their
size and business activities.
Relative to the baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-2 prescribing retention
requirements for the documentation of the internal control structure will result in costs to
NRSROs. NRSROs already have recordkeeping systems in place to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements in Rule 17g-2 before today’s amendments. Therefore, the
recordkeeping costs of this rule will be incremental to the costs associated with these existing
requirements. Specifically, the incremental costs will consist largely of updating their record
retention policies and procedures and retaining and producing the additional record. Based on
analysis for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act (“PRA”), 290 the Commission estimates
that paragraph (b)(12) of Rule 17g-2 and the amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 will

result in total industry-wide one-time costs to NRSROs of approximately $12,000 and total
industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of approximately $3,000. 291
Relative to the baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-3 requiring that NRSROs file an
annual internal controls report with the Commission will result in costs to NRSROs. An NRSRO
will likely incur costs to engage outside counsel to analyze the requirements for the report and to
assist in drafting and reviewing the report. These legal costs are expected to be greater for the
filing of the first report and are expected to depend on the size and complexity of the operations
of the NRSRO. NRSROs also will need to establish and maintain internal processes to gather
and retain evidentiary information to support the report. However, NRSROs already have
processes and controls for preparing and submitting the annual reports required by Rule 17g-3
before today’s amendments. Therefore, the reporting costs of this rule will be incremental to the
costs associated with these existing requirements. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA,
the Commission estimates that paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 and the amendment to paragraph
(b) of Rule 17g-3 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs to NRSROs of approximately
$400,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of approximately $667,000. 292
The amendments to Rule 17g-2 and Rule 17g-3 may result in other costs. For example,
these requirements may affect the timeliness of credit ratings if they result in an NRSRO
implementing internal controls that increase the time required to produce a credit rating. For
example, an NRSRO may choose to implement controls which require the work of a lead credit

291

See section V.A. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs
identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.3. of this release.

analyst to be reviewed by other analysts. As a result, users of credit ratings may incur costs
associated with having credit ratings that are less timely.
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 and the amendments to Rule 17g-3 and Rule 17g-2 could
have a number of effects related to efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 293 As stated
above, these amendments could improve the integrity and quality of credit ratings.
Consequently, users of credit ratings could make more efficient investment decisions based on
this higher-quality information. Market efficiency could also improve if this information is
reflected in asset prices. Consequently, capital formation could improve as capital may flow to
more efficient uses with the benefit of this enhanced information. Alternatively, the timeliness
of credit-related information may be diminished as discussed above. In this case, users of credit
ratings may have access to less timely credit-related information which could decrease the
efficiency of their investment decisions and the efficiency of markets as it could delay the
updating of asset prices to reflect available information. The amendments to Rule 17g-3 and
Rule 17g-2 also will impose costs, some of which may have a component that is fixed in
magnitude across NRSROs and does not vary with the size of the NRSRO. Therefore, the
operating costs per rating of smaller NRSROs may increase relative to that of larger NRSROs,
which could create adverse effects on competition. As a result of these amendments, the barriers
to entry for credit rating agencies to register as NRSROs might be higher for credit rating
agencies, while some NRSROs, particularly smaller firms, may decide to withdraw from
registration as an NRSRO.
There are a number of reasonable alternatives to the amendments. First, the Commission
could have deferred prescribing factors to be taken into consideration when establishing,
293

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

92

maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal control structure. As explained
above, the exercise of considering these factors will provide the NRSROs with an opportunity to
critically evaluate the effectiveness of their existing internal control structures and new
registrants a reference point for designing or modifying existing internal control structures to
comply with the statutory requirement to establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective
internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence to their methodologies
for determining credit ratings. 294 This should improve the overall effectiveness of the internal
control structures of the NRSROs. Moreover, the “catchall” provisions in the rule will mitigate
the risk that an NRSRO treats the factors as a checklist or “safe harbor.” Moreover, as discussed
above, the Commission does not believe that prescribing factors will result in additional costs to
NRSROs.
Second, the Commission could require that the annual internal controls report be made
public, as suggested by one commenter. 295 This alternative could improve the quality of credit
ratings by providing additional information to issuers, subscribers, investors, and other users of
credit ratings to assess the quality of an NRSRO’s internal control structure and, thereby,
promote the NRSROs’ accountability to the market and the issuance of quality credit ratings by
the NRSRO. However, as stated above, publicly disclosing the internal controls reports could
cause NRSROs to be less detailed and candid. This could diminish the utility of the reports as a
means for the Commission to monitor compliance with the requirements of section 15E(c)(3)(A)
of the Exchange Act and for the boards of the NRSROs to meet their obligations under section
15E(t)(3)(C) of the Exchange Act to “oversee” the “effectiveness of the internal control system
with respect to the policies and procedures for determining credit ratings.”
294

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(3)(A).

295

See CII Letter.

93

Third, the Commission could require that the internal controls report be audited by a third
party, as suggested by a commenter. 296 As stated above, the final amendment does not require
that the internal controls report be made public. Consequently, the report is not a public
document that will be relied upon by investors and other users of credit ratings. Rather, it is a
non-public report that will be used by Commission examiners. The Commission has taken these
factors into consideration in balancing the benefits of having the internal controls report audited
by a third party and the costs of such a requirement. The Commission examines each of the ten
NRSROs currently registered with the Commission annually. At this time, the Commission
believes that the annual examinations by the Commission staff will provide a sufficient means
for reviewing the accuracy of the internal controls reports filed by the NRSROs.

SALES AND MARKETING CONFLICT OF INTEREST

Section 932(a)(4) of the Dodd-Frank Act added paragraph (3) to section 15E(h) of the
Exchange Act. 297 Section 15E(h)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall
issue rules to prevent the sales and marketing considerations of an NRSRO from influencing the
production of credit ratings by the NRSRO. 298 Section 15E(h)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act
requires that the Commission’s rules shall provide for exceptions for small NRSROs with respect
to which the Commission determines that the separation of the production of credit ratings and
sales and marketing activities is not appropriate. 299 Section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange
Act requires that the Commission’s rules shall provide for the suspension or revocation of the
registration of an NRSRO if the Commission finds, on the record, after notice and opportunity

for a hearing, that: (1) the NRSRO has committed a violation of a rule issued under section

The Commission proposed to implement sections 15E(h)(3)(A), 15E(h)(3)(B)(i), and
15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act by amending the NRSRO conflict of interest rule (Rule
17g-5). 301 The proposal would amend Rule 17g-5 by: (1) identifying a new prohibited conflict in
paragraph (c) of the rule relating to sales and marketing activities; (2) adding paragraph (f) to the
rule to set forth the finding the Commission would need to make in order to grant a small
NRSRO an exemption from the prohibition; and (3) adding paragraph (g) to the rule to set forth
the standard for suspending or revoking an NRSRO’s registration for violating a rule adopted
under section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act. 302

New Prohibited Conflict

Section 15E(h)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall issue rules
to prevent the sales and marketing considerations of an NRSRO from influencing the production
of credit ratings by the NRSRO. 303 The Commission proposed to implement this provision by
identifying a new conflict of interest in paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-5. 304 Paragraph (c) prohibits
an NRSRO and a person within an NRSRO from having a conflict of interest identified in the

paragraph under all circumstances (an “absolute prohibition”). 305 As proposed, paragraph (c)(8)
of Rule 17g-5 would identify an additional absolute prohibition: issuing or maintaining a credit
rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in sales or marketing of a product or
service of the NRSRO or a product or service of a person associated with the NRSRO also
participates in determining or monitoring the credit rating, or developing or approving
procedures or methodologies used for determining the credit rating, including qualitative or
quantitative models. 306 In effect, this would prohibit persons who participate in sales and
marketing activities from participating in determining or monitoring credit ratings or developing
or approving rating procedures or methodologies.
Several commenters suggested that the requirements in the proposed amendment should
be stronger. 307 Commenters raised concerns that the amendment as proposed would not prohibit
managers from seeking to inappropriately influence credit analysts and the personnel who
develop and approve rating procedures and methodologies. 308 For example, one commenter
stated that the proposal could “be strengthened by barring NRSRO management from taking
negative actions against analysts due to client complaints seeking better ratings, more lenient
treatment of their products, or relief from providing information about a product being rated” and

305

See 17 CFR 240.17g-5(c)(1) through (7). These absolute prohibitions are distinguished from the types of
conflicts identified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-5, which are prohibited unless the NRSRO has taken the
steps to address them as set forth in paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-5. See 17 CFR 240.17g-5(a) and (b). See
also 17 CFR 240.17g-5(d) (defining the term person within an NRSRO to mean an NRSRO, its credit
rating affiliates identified on Form NRSRO, and any partner, officer, director, branch manager, and
employee of the NRSRO or its credit rating affiliates (or any person occupying a similar status or
performing similar functions)).

96

that such actions “inevitably lead to inaccurate and inflated ratings.” 309 A second commenter
stated that the requirement needs to apply “more broadly to any action by any rating agency
employee that has the intent or effect of allowing sales and marketing considerations, including
concern over building market share, to inappropriately influence the rating process or undermine
ratings accuracy.” 310 The commenter stated that this was necessary to address practices such as
“basing analysts’ performance evaluations or compensation on their success in building market
share, allowing investment bankers to influence the selection of analysts involved in rating their
deals, and delaying revisions to rating models because of concerns about their impact on market
share.” 311 A third commenter stated that motivations by management to increase profits and
market share can lead to top-down policies and practices that emphasize higher credit ratings
over improved accuracy and reliability. 312
Other commenters suggested that the proposed requirement be less restrictive. 313 These
commenters recommended, among other things, that the proposed amendment require
procedures to manage the conflict, 314 or apply only when sales and marketing considerations
“influenced” the production of the credit rating. 315

314

315

See A.M. Best Letter. This commenter suggested that if the Commission modified the proposed
amendment to require “influence,” the Commission could, among other things, require an NRSRO to
establish, maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent sales
and marketing considerations of an NRSRO from influencing the production of credit ratings and specify
that those procedures contain language providing that any communications between sales and marketing
personnel and ratings personnel are subject to the broader recordkeeping requirements of Rule 17g-2.

97

After considering these comments, the Commission is revising the rule text to incorporate
into the rule language that is both consistent with the statutory language and with the
requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7 316 (discussed in section II.G.4. of the release),
which would address sources of influence with respect to sales and marketing considerations in
addition to persons involved in sales and marketing activities. Accordingly, the final amendment
modifies the proposal to provide that an NRSRO is prohibited from issuing or maintaining a
credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in determining or monitoring
the credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for determining
the credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative models, also: (1) participates in sales or
marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a product or service of an affiliate of the
NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or marketing considerations. 317
Under the first prong of the final amendment, an NRSRO is prohibited from issuing or
maintaining a credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in determining or
monitoring the credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for
determining the credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative models, also participates in
sales or marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a product or service of an affiliate of
the NRSRO. 318 As with the proposal, this prong of the absolute prohibition is designed to
address situations in which, for example, individuals within the NRSRO who engage in activities

316

As discussed below in section II.G.4. of this release, paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7 provides that an
NRSRO must attach to the form to accompany certain credit rating actions a signed statement by a person
within the NRSRO stating that the person has responsibility for the rating action and, to the best knowledge
of the person: (1) no part of the credit rating was influenced by any other business activities; (2) the credit
rating was based solely upon the merits of the obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated;
and (3) the credit rating was an independent evaluation of the credit risk of the obligor, security, or money
market instrument. Sales and marketing are subparts of “business activities” and including it in paragraph
(c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 is a relevant conforming change.

to sell products and services (both ratings-related and non-ratings-related) of the NRSRO or its
affiliates could seek to influence a specific credit rating to favor an existing or prospective client
or the development of a credit rating procedure or methodology to favor a class of existing or
prospective clients. In practice, the Commission believes the amendment will require an
NRSRO to prohibit personnel that have any role in the determination of credit ratings or the
development or modification of rating procedures or methodologies from having any role in
sales and marketing activities. It also will require an NRSRO to prohibit personnel that have any
role in sales and marketing activities from having any role in the determination of credit ratings
or the development or modification of rating procedures or methodologies. Consequently, these
functions will need to be separate.
Commenters suggested that the proposed requirement be less restrictive. 319 These
commenters recommended, among other things, that the proposed amendment require
procedures to manage the conflict, 320 or apply only when sales and marketing considerations
“influenced” the production of the credit rating. 321 In response, the Commission notes that
section 15E(h)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall issue rules to
prevent the sales and marketing considerations of an NRSRO from influencing the production of
ratings by the NRSRO. 322 Moreover, section 15E(h)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act requires that
the Commission’s rules under section 15E(h)(3)(A) shall provide for exceptions for small
NRSROs with respect to which the Commission determines that the separation of the production
of credit ratings and sales and marketing activities is not appropriate. 323 The Commission

99

therefore believes that it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute to adopt a rule that requires
the separation of the two functions. As stated above, in practice, the final amendment will
require an NRSRO to prohibit the personnel that have any role in sales and marketing activities
from having any role in the determination of credit ratings or the development or modification of
rating procedures and methodologies. In addition, this approach establishes a particularly strong
measure to address the sales and marketing conflict because, as discussed above, the final
amendment establishes an absolute prohibition. Moreover, depending on the facts and
circumstances, it would also violate the first prong of the rule as amended for an individual who
participates in sales and marketing activities to seek to influence the determination of a credit
rating or the rating procedures and methodologies used to determine a credit rating, even if the
individual’s conduct did not influence the credit rating or rating procedures or methodologies.
Further, Commission staff found as part of the examination of the activities of the three
largest NRSROs in rating RMBS and CDOs linked to subprime mortgages that it appeared
“employees responsible for obtaining ratings business would notify other employees, including
those responsible for criteria development, about business concerns they had related to the
criteria.” 324 As the Commission stated in the proposing release, the absolute prohibition was
designed to insulate individuals within the NRSRO responsible for the analytic function from
such sales and marketing concerns and pressures. 325
The Commission shares the concerns raised by commenters about the potential
inappropriate influence that managers may have over employees involved in the determination of

Agencies, pp. 25-26. Commenters pointed to other sources to argue that the proposal should be stronger.

credit ratings or the development or modification of rating procedures and methodologies. 326 In
response, the Commission notes that a manager who participates in sales and marketing activities
and who seeks to influence a credit rating or the rating procedures and methodologies used to
determine the credit rating would be “participating” in determining or monitoring the credit
rating or in developing or approving the rating procedures or methodologies used to determine
the credit rating under paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17g-5, as adopted. 327 Consequently, depending
on the facts and circumstances, the rule as amended would be violated if it was established that
an NRSRO issued or maintained a credit rating in a case in which managers involved in sales
and marketing activities pressured or otherwise offered incentives to analysts working on the
credit rating to take commercial concerns into account in determining the credit rating.
Similarly, depending on the facts and circumstances, it would violate the rule as amended for an
NRSRO to issue or maintain a credit rating that managers involved in sales and marketing
activities sought to influence by pressuring or offering incentives to personnel who developed or
approved the rating procedures or methodologies used to determine the credit rating to take
commercial concerns into account in developing or approving the procedures or methodologies.
Moreover, depending on the facts and circumstances, because the rule is an absolute prohibition,
this conduct would violate the rule, even if a manager did not successfully influence any credit
rating or the rating procedures or methodologies used to determine the credit rating.
326

See, e.g., CFA II Letter.

327

One commenter suggested that management “would not likely fall under the Commission’s definition of
‘participants’ in either sales or marketing activities.” See CFA II Letter. In response, the Commission
notes that, as discussed above, a person within an NRSRO – including a manager – would participate in
sales and marketing activities if, for example: the individual contacted a company that was about to issue
debt and solicited the business of rating the issuance or met with company officials for business
development purposes (for example, to “pitch” the NRSRO’s services); the individual contacted an
institutional investor and offered subscriptions to the NRSRO’s credit ratings or credit analyses; or the
individual was contacted by an issuer about the cost of rating its issuance or by an institutional investor
about the cost of a subscription to the NRSRO’s credit ratings or analyses and the individual provided
information about these costs.

101

Commenters stated that the requirements of proposed paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 are
ambiguous and requested that the Commission clarify various aspects of the proposal. 328 Five
commenters raised concerns as to what it means to participate in sales and marketing activities
under the proposed rule. 329 Four of those commenters requested that the Commission provide
additional guidance on this question. 330 On the other hand, an NRSRO suggested that the
Commission should not provide additional guidance and should allow the NRSRO to define
participate. 331 Similarly, five commenters (including NRSROs) requested the Commission
clarify what constitutes a sales and marketing activity, 332 while an NRSRO suggested that the
Commission not provide additional guidance and allow the NRSRO to determine what
constitutes a sales and marketing activity. 333 One NRSRO stated that the rule should not contain
definitions that “compel large size” by mandating, explicitly or implicitly, minimum numbers of
employees or layers of management. 334
In response to these comments requesting clarification of terms used in the amendment,
the Commission notes that sales and marketing activities involve efforts by an NRSRO to sell or
in any manner market its products and services to prospective customers. 335 Participating in
sales and marketing activities would clearly include certain actions. For example, a person

332

See A.M. Best Letter; COPERA Letter; Kroll Letter; Moody’s Letter; TradeMetrics Letter. For example,

applied too broadly. See A.M. Best Letter; Kroll Letter.

See S&P Letter.

334

See Kroll Letter.

335

The examples of what it means to participate in sales and marketing activities discussed in this section of
the release are intended to assist NRSROs in understanding those terms as they are used in paragraph (c)(8)
of Rule 17g-5.

102

within an NRSRO would participate in a sales and marketing activity if: (1) the individual
contacted a company that was about to issue debt and solicited the business of rating the issuance
or met with company officials for business development purposes (for example, to “pitch” the
NRSRO’s services); (2) the individual contacted an institutional investor and offered
subscriptions to the NRSRO’s credit ratings or credit analyses; (3) the individual was contacted
by an issuer about the cost of rating its issuance or by an institutional investor about the cost of a
subscription to the NRSRO’s credit ratings or analyses and the individual provided information
about these costs.
The Commission recognizes that certain scenarios posed by commenters may not be as
clear-cut as these examples in terms of whether the activities would be considered participating
in sales and marketing activities; each scenario will have to be evaluated based on the particular
facts and circumstances. 336 For example, if rating personnel engage in analytical discussions
with persons outside the NRSRO, including with obligors and issuers who purchase credit rating
services from the NRSRO or with investors and others who purchase subscriptions to the
NRSRO’s credit ratings, that would not constitute participating in a sales and marketing activity
as long as the discussions do not involve commercial matters related to selling or marketing the
NRSRO’s services; however, if the discussions with ratings analysts involved such commercial
matters, the analysts may be considered to be participating in sales and marketing activities. 337
Similarly, if an issuer agrees to have only one meeting with an NRSRO to discuss both analytical
matters relating to, and fees for, obtaining credit ratings for the securities it issues, the NRSRO
could bring a team of analysts and a team of sales and marketing personnel to the meeting. 338 If

103

the sales and marketing team does not attend the portion of the meeting in which analytical
matters are discussed, they would not have participated in the determination of a credit rating.
Similarly, if the analytical team does not attend the portion of the meeting in which commercial
matters are discussed, they would not have participated in a sales and marketing activity.
Further, an analyst would not necessarily participate in a sales or marketing activity if the analyst
gives a presentation at a conference attended by persons who could be prospective purchasers of
the NRSRO’s services. 339 For example, the analyst would generally not be considered to be
participating in a sales or marketing activity if the presentation avoided marketing the services
offered by the NRSRO and focused solely on topics involving credit analysis (for example, the
analytical process used by the NRSRO to determine credit ratings, an analysis of the
creditworthiness of one or more obligors or issuers, or a credit forecast for a particular industry
sector). 340 Similarly, the analyst would not participate in a sales or marketing activity if the
analyst gave this type of presentation in the context of an interview with a news outlet. In each
case, the determination whether the analytical team is participating in sales and marketing
activity would turn on the facts and circumstances.
As noted above, the first prong of the absolute prohibition requires an NRSRO to
separate its analytical functions from its sales and marketing functions. While this is a strong
measure to address the sales and marketing conflict, the Commission also believes that it is

339

See A.M. Best Letter.

340

As discussed throughout this release, one of the objectives of the amendments and new rules being adopted
today is to increase the transparency of the credit rating activities of NRSROs to promote competition
among NRSROs on the basis of the quality of the credit ratings they produce and the procedures and
methodologies they use to determine credit ratings. The persons within an NRSRO responsible for
determining credit ratings and developing the procedures and methodologies used to determine credit
ratings can promote this transparency, given their responsibilities and expertise. Consequently, the
Commission does not intend the new absolute prohibition in paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 to constrain
them from helping market participants better understand the quality of an NRSRO’s credit ratings and
procedures and methodologies an NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings.

104

appropriate to revise the rule text to incorporate language about persons participating in
production of a credit rating being “influenced” by sales and marketing considerations. 341
Section 15E(h)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall issue rules to
prevent the sales and marketing considerations of an NRSRO from influencing the production of
credit ratings by the NRSRO. 342 Given the concerns raised by commenters, this statutory
language, the language in section 15E(q)(2)(F) of the Exchange Act, 343 and Rule 17 g-7, the
Commission is modifying the proposal to add a second prong to the absolute prohibition. Under
the second prong, an NRSRO is prohibited from issuing or maintaining a credit rating where a
person within the NRSRO who participates in determining or monitoring the credit rating, or
developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for determining the credit rating,
including qualitative and quantitative models, also is influenced by sales or marketing
considerations. 344 Thus, this prong of the absolute prohibition is consistent with the provision of
Rule 17g-7 that specifically requires a statement that no part of the rating was “influenced” by
business activities.
In connection with making the evaluation necessary for the second prong of the absolute
prohibition, the Commission believes there are a number of possible channels of influence that
should be considered, such as compensation arrangements that may incentivize analysts to
produce inflated credit ratings to increase or retain the NRSRO’s market share, performance

341

II Letter (stating that the rule should be re-proposed).

342

15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h)(3)(A) (emphasis added). See also section 15E(q)(2)(F) .

343

Section 15(E)(q)(2)(F) provides that the Commission’s rules must require an NRSRO to include an
attestation with any credit rating it issues affirming that no part of the rating was influenced by any other
business activities, that the rating was based solely on the merits of the instruments being rated, and that
such rating was an independent evaluation of the risks and merits of the instrument). “Sales” and
“marketing” are a subparts of “business activities.”

344

See paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of Rule 17g-5.

105

evaluation systems that reward analysts who produce inflated credit ratings to increase or retain
the NRSRO’s market share, compliance personnel who unduly influence credit analysts to inflate
credit ratings in response to complaints by clients, clients such as rated entities who pressure
analysts to produce inflated credit ratings to retain their business, or managers who are not
involved in sales and marketing activities but may seek to pressure analysts to produce inflated
credit ratings to increase or retain the NRSRO’s market share.
In addition, the Commission notes that the sales and marketing prohibition is being added
to a comprehensive set of existing requirements that address NRSRO conflicts and, as discussed
below, the Commission is adopting additional measures to address conflicts. 345 Consequently,
the sales and marketing prohibition should not be viewed in isolation but rather as part of a set of
requirements (both statutory and regulatory) pursuant to which NRSROs must disclose and
manage conflicts of interest and, in some cases, avoid them altogether. For example, paragraph
(b)(1) of Rule 17g-5 identifies the conflict of being paid by issuers or underwriters to determine
credit ratings (the issuer-pay conflict), and under paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-5 and section
15E(h)(1) of the Exchange Act, an NRSRO with this conflict must establish, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address and manage the
conflict. 346 An NRSRO that permits a corporate culture in which managers seek to
inappropriately influence analysts and the personnel who develop and approve rating procedures
and methodologies could not be viewed as having or enforcing policies and procedures
reasonably designed to address the issuer-pay conflict and, consequently, this type of conduct
would violate section 15E(h)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17g-5.

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h); 17 CFR 240.17g-5.

346

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h); 17 CFR 240.17g-5.

106

Further, as discussed below in section II.G.4. of this release, the Commission is adopting
a requirement that an NRSRO must attach to the form to accompany certain credit rating actions
a signed statement by a person within the NRSRO stating that the person has responsibility for
the rating action and, to the best knowledge of the person: (1) no part of the credit rating was
influenced by any other business activities; (2) the credit rating was based solely upon the merits
of the obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated; and (3) the credit rating was an
independent evaluation of the credit risk of the obligor, security, or money market instrument. 347
If any of these requirements are not satisfied, such person would not be able to truthfully make
this attestation.
The Commission made another modification to the proposal in response to a comment
suggesting that the text of the amendment be revised to reference the “products or services of the
NRSRO’s affiliated entities” in place of the proposed reference to a “product or service of a
person associated with the [NRSRO].” 348 A “person associated” with the NRSRO includes
natural persons. 349 The commenter stated that, as proposed, the amendment could preclude a
natural person from participating in the credit rating process “if he or she operates a completely
different business (such as a photography studio on the side).” 350 This would be an overly broad
application of the amendment, as it is designed to prevent sales and marketing of products and
services of the NRSRO or its affiliated companies from influencing the credit rating process.
Consequently, the final amendment has been modified from the proposal to apply to products
and services of the affiliates of the NRSRO (rather than persons associated with the NRSRO). 351

However, the Commission notes that outside businesses of employees can raise potential
conflicts. 352 Consequently, pursuant to section 15E(h)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17g-5,
an NRSRO must have policies, procedures, and controls to address employees engaging in
outside businesses if the NRSRO permits employees to operate outside businesses. 353
Two commenters stated that paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 may be redundant, given the
existing absolute prohibition in paragraph (c)(6) of Rule 17g-5. 354 In response, the Commission
believes it is appropriate to retain paragraph (c)(6) because it complements paragraph (c)(8) of
Rule 17g-5, as adopted. In particular, paragraph (c)(6) of Rule 17g-5 addresses the conflict that
arises when persons within an NRSRO involved in determining credit ratings or developing or
approving rating methodologies also negotiate, discuss, or arrange the fees paid for determining
credit ratings. 355 Thus, it focuses on preventing persons within the NRSRO responsible for
credit analysis from being influenced by business considerations (for example, issuing ratings
favorable to a client with whom they negotiated a substantial fee). Paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g5, as adopted, addresses the conflict that arises when persons within an NRSRO involved in sales
and marketing activities also participate in determining credit ratings or developing or approving
rating procedures and methodologies. Thus, it focuses on preventing the persons within the

For example, an analyst operating an outside business could seek to solicit business from persons employed
by an obligor that the analyst rates or an issuer of securities the analyst rates.

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h)(1) (requiring each NRSRO to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the business of the NRSRO and
affiliated persons and affiliated companies thereof, to address and manage any conflicts of interest that can
arise from such business); 17 CFR 240.17g-5 (prohibiting NRSROs from having conflicts of interest unless
they disclose and manage the conflicts or, in some cases, absolutely prohibiting the conflict).

354

See DBRS Letter; Kroll Letter. Under paragraph (c)(6) of Rule 17g-5, an NRSRO is prohibited from
issuing or maintaining a credit rating where the fee paid for the rating was negotiated, discussed, or
arranged by a person within the NRSRO who has responsibility for participating in determining credit
ratings or for developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for determining credit ratings,
including qualitative and quantitative models.

NRSRO responsible for generating business for the NRSRO from influencing the work of the
persons responsible for credit analysis (for example, pressuring them to develop rating
procedures and methodologies that favor the NRSRO’s clients or prospective clients).
Finally, several commenters stated that the proposed amendment would negatively
impact smaller NRSROs. 356 As discussed below, the final amendments to Rule 17g-5 provide a
mechanism for small NRSROs to apply for an exemption from the absolute prohibition. 357
Under the final amendment, the Commission may grant an exemption if it finds that due to the
small size of the NRSRO it is not appropriate to require the separation within the NRSRO of the
production of credit ratings from sales and marketing activities and such exemption is in the
public interest. 358
For all of the reasons discussed above, the Commission is adopting the amendment with
the modifications discussed above. Moreover, for those reasons, the Commission is not
persuaded that it is necessary to re-propose the rule as suggested by one commenter. 359
However, the Commission may consider further rulemaking to address conflicts of interest
inherent in the NRSRO industry as appropriate and as circumstances warrant.

Exemption for “Small” NRSROs

Section 15E(h)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act requires that the Commission’s rules under
section 15E(h)(3)(A) shall provide for exceptions for small NRSROs with respect to which the
Commission determines that the separation of the production of credit ratings and sales and
marketing activities is not appropriate. 360 To implement this provision, the Commission

proposed to amend Rule 17g-5 by adding paragraph (f). 361 As proposed, paragraph (f) would
provide a mechanism for a small NRSRO to apply in writing for an exemption from the absolute
prohibition that would be established by adding paragraph (c)(8) to Rule 17g-5. 362 In particular,
the proposed amendment provided that upon written application by an NRSRO, the Commission
may exempt, either conditionally or unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, such
NRSRO from the provisions of paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 if the Commission finds that due
to the small size of the NRSRO it is not appropriate to require the separation within the NRSRO
of the production of credit ratings from sales and marketing activities and such exemption is in
the public interest. 363
The Commission stated in the proposing release that in some cases the small size of an
NRSRO could make a complete separation of the sales and marketing function from the credit
rating analytical function inappropriate. 364 For example, the NRSRO may not have enough staff
(or the resources to hire additional staff) to establish separate functions. 365 In this case, the

362

See paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76

may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of
persons, securities, or transactions from any provision or provisions of the Exchange Act or any rule or
regulation thereunder, to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest
and is consistent with the protection of investors. 17 U.S.C. 78mm. Consequently, an NRSRO could
request to be exempt from the sales and marketing prohibition pursuant to this more general authority in
section 36. The Commission has established rules providing mechanisms for registrants – such as brokerdealers – to request an exemption from specific rule requirements. See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(b)(3); 17
CFR 240.15c3-3(k)(3); 17 CFR 240.17a-5(m)(3). The proposed amendment was modeled after these
provisions. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33540.

Commission stated that it would entertain requests for relief, although it may impose conditions
designed to preserve as much of the separation between these two functions as possible. 366
The Commission is adding paragraph (f) to Rule 17g-5 substantially as proposed, but
with a technical modification to the rule text in response to comments. 367 In particular, the final
amendment provides that, upon written application by an NRSRO, the Commission may exempt,
either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, such NRSRO from the provisions of
paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 if the Commission finds that due to the small size of the NRSRO
it is not appropriate to require the separation within the NRSRO of the production of credit
ratings from sales and marketing activities and such exemption is in the public interest. 368
Several commenters expressed support for the objective of the proposed amendment. 369
Supporters argued that it could be difficult for smaller NRSROs to maintain the strict separation
of sales and marketing activities from the production of credit ratings, as would be required
under paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5, as proposed. 370 In contrast, several commenters expressed
concerns with the proposed amendment, generally arguing that the proposed amendment should
be narrowed or eliminated altogether because the size of an NRSRO does not affect whether the
potential conflict could influence a credit rating. 371 For example, one of these commenters stated

See paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5. The Commission is modifying the proposal to remove redundant text, as
suggested by a commenter. See DBRS Letter. The Commission originally proposed that “[u]pon written
application by a [NRSRO], the Commission may exempt, either conditionally or unconditionally or on
specified terms and conditions, such [NRSRO] from the provisions of paragraph (c)(8) of [Rule 17g-5].”
The modification removes the phrase “conditionally or” as it is redundant of the phrase “on specified terms
and conditions.” See paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5.

that “if a credit rating agency is too small to separate its rating process from its marketing
process, it should not qualify as an NRSRO.” 372
In response to concerns about providing for exemptions for small NRSROs, the
Commission notes that section 15E(h)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission’s rules issued under section 15E(h)(3)(A) shall provide for exceptions for small
NRSROs with respect to which the Commission determines that the separation of the production
of credit ratings and sales and marketing activities is not appropriate. 373 The final amendment
implements this statutory requirement but in a manner that will require the Commission to make
a specific finding before granting an exemption; namely, that due to the small size of the
NRSRO it is not appropriate to require the separation within the NRSRO of the production of
credit ratings from sales and marketing activities and such exemption is in the public interest. 374
The Commission considered the concerns expressed by commenters about granting any
relief to small NRSROs in considering whether to adopt a self-executing exemption, which was
suggested by a commenter. 375 Under the final amendment, exemptions will be granted on a
case-by-case basis, after analyzing the facts and circumstances the applying NRSRO presents in
its request for relief and any other relevant facts and circumstances. Any exemptive relief
granted can be tailored to the specific circumstances of the NRSRO and can include specific
terms and conditions designed to mitigate the sales and marketing conflict and help ensure that
any relief that may be provided to a small NRSRO does not undermine the overarching purpose
of section of 15E(h)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act. The ability to tailor exemptive relief on a case-

by-case basis will allow the Commission the flexibility to specify conditions that address the
conflict in a way that takes into account the specific circumstances of the NRSRO requesting the
relief (including its size, business model, and the steps it has taken to mitigate sales and
marketing conflicts). For these reasons, the Commission does not believe it would be
appropriate to establish a self-executing exemption.
Commenters addressed various aspects of potential exemption orders the Commission
might grant under the proposed amendment. For example, several NRSROs commented on how
the Commission should determine “small” for purposes of granting exemptions. 376 Two
commenters stated that all NRSROs that are smaller than the three largest NRSROs should be
considered small. 377 Three commenters suggested that annual revenue should be the metric for
determining if an NRSRO is small. 378 Two commenters stated that the Commission should
make the size determination on a case-by-case basis, 379 while one commenter suggested a selfexecuting exemption under which an NRSRO would be automatically exempt if its total revenue
falls below a certain threshold. 380 On the other hand, one opponent of the proposal stated that
revenue is not an appropriate measure for granting an exemption and suggested, if the
Commission proceeds with an exemption, that it be based on other metrics. 381

See S&P Letter (“Other metrics, such as the number of personnel, or number of ratings issued in a practice
area, may provide a more meaningful metric for the granting of any exemption”).

113

Commenters also addressed the duration of an exemption. 382 One supporter of granting
exemptions under the proposal suggested that the Commission periodically re-evaluate whether
the NRSRO continued to be small and provide it with a transition period in the event the
Commission determines it is no longer small. 383 Another commenter, opposing the proposal,
suggested that if the Commission does grant an exemption, it should be very limited, and that if
the Commission later determines the NRSRO is not small, it should have only a short transition
period. 384 This commenter added that an exempted NRSRO should have to publicly disclose the
rules from which it is exempt. 385
Several commenters addressed the conditions that should be part of an exemption order
under the proposal. 386 Some stated that even if an NRSRO is exempt, the amendments to Rule
17g-5 should make clear that NRSROs remain subject to the overarching prohibition against
allowing sales and marketing considerations to influence credit ratings. 387 Two commenters
suggested that any exemption should be contingent upon the NRSRO adhering to certain
requirements. 388 Another commenter suggested that any NRSRO that is granted an exemption
under the proposal should be required to indicate on the homepage of its website that it is a

requirement); CFA/AFR Letter (suggesting that the application should include a section on what steps the
NRSRO is taking to ensure sales and marketing considerations do not influence rating decisions).

recipient of the exemption. 389 One commenter that opposed the proposed exemption identified
additional conditions the Commission should consider if it adopts the proposal. 390
In making its finding for purposes of determining whether to grant an exemption, the
Commission will evaluate the particular facts and circumstances of the application. In addition,
the Commission may specify conditions designed to mitigate the sales and marketing conflict
without imposing an absolute prohibition. Although the Commission is not modifying the
exemption process from the proposal, suggestions by commenters may be helpful to the
Commission in undertaking the analysis of whether a particular NRSRO should be considered
“small” and in considering how to tailor the exemptive relief to mitigate the sales and marketing
conflict.

Suspending or Revoking a Registration

Section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission’s rules under
section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act shall provide for suspension or revocation of the registration
of an NRSRO if the Commission finds, on the record, after notice and opportunity for a hearing,
that the NRSRO has committed a violation of “a rule issued under this subsection” and the
violation of the rule affected a credit rating. 391 While section 15E(h)(3)(A) relates only to the
conflict arising from sales and marketing activities, section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) – by using the term
“subsection” – has a broader scope in that it refers to all rules issued under section 15E(h) of the
Exchange Act. Consequently, the proposed amendment implementing section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii)

389

See Fitch Letter.

390

See S&P Letter (suggesting that the Commission should “specify the terms of the activities permitted and
require that the NRSRO have policies to address the potential conflict, that the policies be transparent, and
that compliance of the policies be well documented.”).

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h)(3)(B)(ii).

115

addressed violations of any rule adopted under section 15E(h). Section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) does not
require that the violation of the rule under section 15E(h) be “willful.”
Currently, the Commission can seek to suspend or revoke the registration of an NRSRO,
in addition to other potential sanctions, under section 15E(d) of the Exchange Act. 392 In
particular, section 15E(d) provides that the Commission shall, by order, censure, place
limitations on the activities, functions, or operations of, suspend for a period not exceeding
twelve months, or revoke the registration of an NRSRO if the Commission finds, “on the record
after notice and opportunity for a hearing,” that such sanction is “necessary for the protection of
investors and in the public interest” and the NRSRO, or a person associated with the NRSRO
(whether prior to or subsequent to becoming so associated), has engaged in one or more of six
categories of conduct specified in sections 15E(d)(1)(A) through (F) of the Exchange Act. 393
Section 15E(d)(1)(A) specifies the first category of conduct: that the NRSRO or an associated
person has committed or omitted any act, or has been subject to an order or finding, enumerated
in subparagraphs (A), (D), (E), (G), or (H) of section 15(b)(4) of the Exchange Act; has been
convicted of any offense identified in section 15(b)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act; or has been
enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice identified in section 15(b)(4)(C) of the Exchange
Act. 394 The acts enumerated in section 15(b)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act include that the person

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1)(A); see also 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (G), and (H). Section
15E(d)(1)(B) specifies the second category of conduct: that the NRSRO or an associated person has been
convicted during the ten-year period preceding the date on which an application for registration is filed
with the Commission, or at any time thereafter, of: (1) any crime that is punishable by imprisonment for
one or more years, and that is not described in section 15(b)(4)(B); or (2) a substantially equivalent crime
by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1)(B). Section 15E(d)(1)(C) specifies
the third category of conduct: that the NRSRO or an associated person is subject to any order of the
Commission barring or suspending the right of the person to be associated with an NRSRO. See 15 U.S.C.
78o-7(d)(1)(C). Section 15E(d)(1)(D) specifies the fourth category of conduct: that the NRSRO or an
associated person fails to file the annual certification required under section 15E(b)(2) of the Exchange Act.
See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1)(D). Section 15E(d)(1)(E) specifies the fifth category of conduct: that the

116

has willfully violated any provision of the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations under the
Exchange Act. 395 Therefore, the Commission has the authority, if it makes the finding under
section 15E(d)(1)(A), to suspend or revoke the registration of an NRSRO for a willful violation
of Rule 17g-5, but does not have the authority to do so under section 15E(d)(1)(A) for violations
of Rule 17g-5 that are not willful. 396
In addition to proceedings under section 15E(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, the Commission
can take action under section 15E(d)(2). 397 This section provides that the Commission may
temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the registration of an NRSRO with respect to a
particular class or subclass of securities, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and
opportunity for a hearing, that the NRSRO does not have adequate financial and managerial
resources to consistently produce credit ratings with integrity. 398 Furthermore, section 21C of
the Exchange Act provides the Commission with authority, among other things, to enter an order
requiring, among other things, that a person cease and desist from continuing to violate, or future
violations of, a provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder. 399

NRSRO or an associated person fails to maintain adequate financial and managerial resources to
consistently produce credit ratings with integrity. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1)(E). Finally, section
15E(d)(1)(F) specifies the sixth category of conduct: that the NRSRO or an associated person has failed
reasonably to supervise, with a view to preventing a violation of the securities laws, an individual who
commits such a violation, if the individual is subject to the supervision of that person. See 15 U.S.C. 78o7(d)(1)(F).

period of time, as determined by the Commission, to produce ratings that are accurate for that class or
subclass of securities and such other factors as the Commission may determine. See 15 U.S.C. 78o7(d)(2)(B).

In the proposing release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that a rule
implementing section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act should work in conjunction with
sections 15E(d) and 21C of the Exchange Act. 400 Consequently, the Commission proposed
adding paragraph (g) to Rule 17g-5. 401 This paragraph provided that in a proceeding pursuant to
section 15E(d) or section 21C of the Exchange Act, the Commission shall suspend or revoke the
registration of an NRSRO if the Commission finds in such proceeding that the NRSRO has
violated a rule issued under section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act, the violation affected a credit
rating, and that suspension or revocation is necessary for the protection of investors and in the
public interest. 402 This provision was proposed to be placed in Rule 17g-5, given that it is the
predominant rule issued under section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act. 403
The first two findings in the proposed amendment mirrored the text of section
15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act. 404 The final finding – that the suspension or revocation is
necessary for the protection of investors and in the public interest – is a common finding that the
Commission must make to take disciplinary action against a registered person or entity. 405 It is
not, however, a finding that the Commission must make in a proceeding under section 21C. 406

406

See 15 U.S.C. 78u-3.

118

Further, unlike section 15E(d) of the Exchange Act, the Commission can take action under
section 21C for violations of the securities laws even if the violations are not willful. 407
Moreover, section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act does not prescribe the maximum
amount of time for which an NRSRO could be suspended, whereas section 15E(d) provides that
a suspension shall not exceed twelve months. 408 Consequently, a proceeding pursuant to
paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-5 brought under section 21C could result in a suspension that exceeds
twelve months. Given that section 21C of the Exchange Act has a lower threshold for intent to
establish a violation, and given the substantial consequences of suspending or revoking a
registration, the Commission stated a preliminarily belief in the proposing release that the public
interest finding would be an appropriate predicate to a suspension or revocation of an NRSRO’s
registration under section 21C of the Exchange Act. 409
Two commenters addressed whether the Commission should adopt, pursuant to section
15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act, an independent and alternative process for suspending or
revoking an NRSRO’s registration beyond the processes set forth in sections 15E(d) and 21C of
the Exchange Act. 410 Both commenters agreed with the Commission’s proposal that the
processes for suspension or revocation currently available under the Exchange Act are
sufficient. 411 One commenter stated that section 15E(h)(3)(B)(iii) of the Exchange Act should
work in conjunction with proceedings already available under sections 15E(d) and 21C of the
Exchange Act. 412 Similarly, a second commenter stated that proceedings currently available

under the Exchange Act are adequate and that no alternative process is necessary, but stated that
if the Commission does implement a separate process, there should be certain prerequisites to its
decision to suspend or revoke a registration. 413
The Commission is persuaded that it is appropriate to adopt an amendment to Rule 17g-5
that incorporates the statutory provisions governing the suspension or revocation of an NRSRO’s
registration (rather than a stand-alone rule). Consequently, the Commission is incorporating the
statutory provisions into paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-5, as proposed, but with modifications from
the proposal. 414 Two commenters stated that the proposed rule should incorporate only section
15E(d) of the Exchange Act in response to the Commission’s requests for comment on whether
the amendment should incorporate section 15E(d) and section 21C. 415 One of these commenters
added that the section 21C standard is “too low and its consequences too high” and is therefore
inappropriate to use in considering suspension or revocation of an NRSRO’s registration. 416 The
other commenter stated that authority under section 15E(d) is “adequate,” making it unnecessary
for the Commission to incorporate section 21C into the rule, and that not all of the provisions of
section 21C are applicable to NRSROs. 417
The Commission believes that it is not necessary to incorporate section 21C of the
Exchange Act into the provision governing the suspension or revocation of an NRSRO’s
registration for violating a rule issued under section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act, but not for the
reasons stated by the commenters. The Commission believes the rule can be modified in a way
413

See S&P Letter.

414

The Commission is making one technical modification to the proposal by adding the word “credit” before
the word “rating.” See paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-5.

415

See A.M. Best Letter; S&P Letter.

416

See A.M. Best Letter (stating that the process under section 21C is inappropriate because it has no
requirement of a public interest finding and provides no suspension limits).

See S&P Letter (stating that certain provisions of section 21C are applicable to brokers, dealers, and
investment advisors, among others, but not to NRSROs).

120

that achieves one objective of the proposal – providing for the suspension or revocation of the
registration of an NRSRO for violations that are not willful – without incorporating section 21C.
Instead, the rule can be modified from the proposal so that it includes a finding that the
Commission must make in the context of a proceeding under section 15E(d)(1) of the Exchange
Act that is in lieu of the findings specified in sections 15E(d)(1)(A) through (F) of the Exchange
Act. As discussed above, the finding specified in section 15E(d)(1)(A) is that the NRSRO or an
associated person committed or omitted any act, or has been subject to an order or finding,
enumerated in section 15(b)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act, among other sections. 418 The acts
enumerated in section 15(b)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act include that the person has willfully
violated any provision of the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations under the Exchange
Act. 419 Therefore, the Commission has the authority, if it makes a finding under section
15E(d)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act, to suspend or revoke the registration of an NRSRO for a
violation of Rule 17g-5, but only if the violation is willful. 420 The alternative finding does not
require a finding that the violation was willful, and the Commission can therefore suspend or
revoke the registration of an NRSRO using this alternative without a finding of willfulness and
without the need to institute the proceeding under section 21C.
For these reasons, the Commission is modifying the rule from the proposal to establish a
finding that must be made in the context of a proceeding under section 15E(d)(1) of the
Exchange Act that is in lieu of the findings specified in sections 15E(d)(1)(A) through (F). 421 In
particular, paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-5, as adopted, provides that in a proceeding pursuant to
418

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1)(A). See also 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (G), and (H).

421

The Commission does not intend the final amendment to affect in any manner the Commission’s ability to
suspend or revoke the registration of an NRSRO under section 15E(d)(1) of the Exchange Act based upon a
finding specified under sections 15E(d)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F).

121

section 15E(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, the Commission shall suspend or revoke the registration
of an NRSRO if the Commission finds, in lieu of a finding required under sections 15E(d)(1)(A),
(B), (C), (D), (E), or (F) of the Exchange Act, that the NRSRO has violated a rule issued under
section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act (for example, Rule 17g-5) and that the violation affected a
credit rating. 422
The alternative finding includes the first two prongs of the proposed finding: (1) that the
NRSRO has violated a rule issued under section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act; and (2) that the
violation affected a credit rating. As discussed above and in the proposing release, these two
prongs of the finding mirror the text of section 15E(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act. 423 In
addition, the alternative finding must be made in the context of a proceeding under section
15E(d)(1). Consequently, the Commission must find, “on the record after notice and opportunity
for a hearing,” that suspension or revocation is “necessary for the protection of investors and in
the public interest.” 424 In this way, the alternative finding also incorporates the public interest
finding that was part of the proposed finding, which the Commission continues to believe is
appropriate given the severity of the sanction of suspending or revoking an NRSRO’s
registration. 425

issued under this subsection” and the violation of the rule affected a credit rating).

425

A number of commenters addressed whether the Commission should be required to make a public interest
finding to suspend or revoke an NRSRO’s registration in a proceeding under proposed paragraph (g) of
Rule 17g-5 pursuant to section 21C of the Exchange Act. See AFSCME Letter; A.M. Best Letter; Better
Markets Letter; FSR Letter; Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter. Four commenters supported the requirement.
See A.M. Best Letter; FSR Letter; Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter. One commenter that supported this
aspect of the proposal stated that a public interest finding is necessary “to consider whether, in fact, a
violation had any impact on the public.” See A.M. Best Letter. A second commenter added that a public
interest finding is appropriate because a sanction of suspension or revocation is significant and that
NRSROs play an important role in the financial markets. See S&P Letter. In contrast, two commenters

122

The final amendment – because it incorporates section 15E(d) only – is different from the
proposed amendment in that the Commission is limited to suspending a registration for a period
not exceeding twelve months. 426 The Commission does not view this as a significant difference.
To the extent the Commission believes a credit rating agency should stop operating as an
NRSRO for a period longer than twelve months, the Commission can seek to revoke its
registration. 427
Finally, three commenters addressed the factual predicate necessary to support a finding
that the violation affected a credit rating. 428 The commenters generally stated that a finding that
a rule violation affected a credit rating is only part of the appropriate analysis and is not, by

opposed the proposed required public interest finding. See AFSCME Letter; Better Markets Letter. One of
these commenters stated that the finding could make it more difficult for the Commission to sanction an
NRSRO, and that it provides NRSROs with additional defenses to potential sanctions. See Better Markets
Letter. The other commenter suggested that the standard be changed from “necessary for the protection of
investors and in the public interest” to “consistent with the public interest” to give the Commission more
flexibility in the enforcement remedy. See AFSCME Letter. Both commenters suggested the increased
threshold in the proposal to suspend or revoke an NRSRO’s registration was not the intent of Congress.
See AFSCME Letter; Better Markets Letter. In response to these comments, the Commission believes – as
indicated above – that the public interest finding is appropriate given the severity of the sanctions. In
response to the commenter that suggested the standard be changed from “necessary for the protection of
investors and in the public interest” to “consistent with the public interest” to give the Commission more
flexibility in the enforcement remedy, the Commission notes that the standard “necessary for the protection
of investors and in the public interest” is a standard used consistently throughout the Commission’s rules
and the Exchange Act. The Commission is not persuaded it is necessary to use a different standard in this
instance. Consequently, because the finding required under the final amendment must be made in the
context of a proceeding under section 15E(d) of the Exchange Act, the final amendment incorporates the
public interest finding in that section.
426

15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1).

427

Commenters addressed whether the rule should limit the length of a suspension under section 21C of the
Exchange Act. See A.M. Best Letter; Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter. Two commented that the ability to
suspend the registration of an NRSRO for up to twelve months under section 15E(d) was sufficient and,
therefore, a suspension proceeding under section 21C is unnecessary. See A.M. Best Letter; S&P Letter.
One commenter stated that there should be a time limit for a suspension under section 21C and, while
stating that the twelve month limit under section 15E(d) is sufficient, suggested an alternative approach
based on the time horizon of the associated credit rating. See Morningstar Letter (suggesting, as an
alternative, that the Commission “could use a multiple of the intended time horizon associated with the
rating” as a maximum suspension). As discussed above, the finding required under the final amendment
must be made in a proceeding under section 15E(d)(1), which limits suspensions to a period not to exceed
twelve months. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1).

428

See A.M. Best Letter; Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter.

123

itself, enough to suspend or revoke an NRSRO’s registration. 429 One commenter added that any
suspension or revocation proceeding must “take into account all relevant factors of the particular
circumstance at issue.” 430 The other two commenters recommended additional findings that
should be considered in making a determination that a violation of a rule affected a credit
rating. 431 In response, the Commission notes that to suspend or revoke an NRSRO’s registration
under section 15E(d)(1) of the Exchange Act the Commission must find, among other things,
that doing so is necessary for the protection of investors and in the public interest. 432 This will
entail consideration of the particular facts and circumstances of each case in crafting an
appropriate remedy.

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the amendments relating
to the sales and marketing conflict of interest. 433 The baseline that existed before today’s
amendments was one in which an NRSRO was not explicitly prohibited from issuing or
maintaining a credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in determining or
monitoring the credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for
determining the credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative models, also: (1) participates

See A.M. Best Letter.

431

See Morningstar Letter (stating that the findings should be “supported by Commission evidence that the
undue influence…resulted in the NRSRO issuing a credit rating without conforming to its documented
procedures and methodologies and that investors who relied on those ratings were harmed.”); S&P Letter
(stating that the following factors should be a factual predicate to support the finding that the violation
affected a rating: “(i) there was an appropriate attempt to influence the rating decision; (ii) the NRSRO did
not adhere in material respects to its applicable policies and procedures; and (iii) the rating decision was not
honestly held by the rating committee analysts who voted for it at the time it was issued.”).

432

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(1).

433

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may
derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today.

124

in sales or marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a product or service of an affiliate
of the NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or marketing considerations. However, section
15E(h)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17g-5, thereunder, require NRSROs to establish,
maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address and
manage any conflicts of interest that can arise from the business of the NRSRO. 434 In addition,
paragraph (c)(6) of Rule 17g-5 prohibits an NRSRO from issuing or maintaining a credit rating
where the fee paid for the rating was negotiated, discussed, or arranged by a person within the
NRSRO who has responsibility for participating in determining credit ratings or for developing
or approving procedures or methodologies used for determining credit ratings, including
qualitative and quantitative models. Rule 17g-6 prohibits an NRSRO from engaging in certain
unfair, coercive, or abusive practices such as conditioning the issuance of a credit rating on the
purchase of other services or products of the NRSRO. 435
Relative to this baseline, paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5, as amended, should result in
benefits. For example, the amendment should decrease the probability that undue influences on
credit analysts based on sales and marketing considerations could impact the objectivity of an
NRSRO’s credit rating process. 436 Certain academic studies suggest that NRSROs may have
engaged in “ratings catering” in which an NRSRO will deliberately inflate a credit rating in order
to induce the purchase of the credit rating by the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the rated

security. 437 Involving credit analysts in sales and marketing activities (which are designed to
obtain business) could potentially influence them to inappropriately take business considerations
into account when determining credit ratings. Such influence may also arise from other
channels, such as compensation arrangements that may incentivize analysts to produce inflated
credit ratings to increase or retain the NRSRO’s market share, performance evaluation systems
that reward analysts who produce inflated credit ratings to increase or retain the NRSRO’s
market share, clients such as rated entities who pressure analysts to produce inflated credit
ratings to retain their business, or managers that are not involved in sales and marketing activities
but may seek to pressure analysts to produce inflated credit ratings to increase or retain the
NRSRO’s market share. The two-pronged absolute prohibition is designed to insulate credit
analysts from sales and marketing concerns and pressures that may arise through any channel.
This could enhance the integrity and quality of credit ratings.
Relative to the baseline, paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 will result in costs to NRSROs.
For example, some NRSROs may incur costs for hiring additional personnel, given the need to
separate the analytical and sales and marketing functions. Commenters did not provide data for
this specific cost. However, some NRSROs may choose to reallocate responsibilities among
existing staff in order to meet the requirement. This cost of hiring additional personnel will
likely vary significantly with the size of the NRSRO and the degree of existing separation
between analytical staff and sales and marketing personnel. 438 NRSROs may also incur costs to

Competitive Pressure for CDO Ratings, Bolton, Freixas, and Shapiro, The Credit Ratings Game.

The Commission estimates the cost of hiring an additional credit analyst to be $55,600 on a one-time basis
and $591,000 per year thereafter (2080 work hours per year x $284 for a fixed income research analyst
(intermediate) = $591,000; 200 hours x $278 for a senior human resources representative = $55,600). The
Commission estimates the cost of hiring an additional sales and marketing staff member to be $55,600 on a
one-time basis and $528,000 per year thereafter (2080 work hours per year x $254 for a marketing manager
= $528,000; 200 hours x $278 for a senior human resources representative = $55,600). The salary figures

make other operational changes, such as changes to communication policies, to ensure that credit
analysts are not influenced by sales or marketing considerations from other channels. These
incremental costs may vary based on the current operational structure of NRSROs. It is also
possible that NRSROs may incur costs related to changes in the compensation arrangements of
credit analysts. 439
An NRSRO also will incur costs for updating its written policies and procedures to
address and manage conflicts of interest required under section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 17g-5 and to file with the Commission an update of its registration on Form NRSRO to
account for the updated policies and procedures. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the
Commission estimates that paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 will result in total industry-wide onetime costs to NRSROs of approximately $354,000. 440
Relative to the baseline, paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5 will result in costs to NRSROs to the
extent they expend resources to draft and submit a written request for an exemption under
paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5. The Commission believes that an NRSRO would likely engage
outside counsel to assist in drafting the request. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the
Commission estimates that paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5 will result in costs to NRSROs of
approximately $62,000 per request. 441 However, if a small NRSRO is granted an exemption
from the absolute prohibition, it could avoid having to hire additional personnel to undertake
2013, modified by Commission staff to account for a 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.
439

The cost of changes to operational and compensation arrangements have been reflected in the PRA burdens
discussed in section IV.D.5. and section IV.D.6. of this release.

440

See section V.B. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
one-time costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs identified in
the PRA analysis in section IV.D.5. of this release.

sales and marketing activities that were otherwise undertaken by individuals involved in the
production of credit ratings.
Relative to the baseline, paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-5 should not result in additional costs
to NRSROs. NRSROs already are subject to the remedy of suspension or revocation under
section 15E(d) the Exchange Act.
The amendments to Rule 17g-5 also may result in other costs. For example, prohibiting
persons within an NRSRO who participate in determining or monitoring the credit ratings, or
developing or approving rating procedures or methodologies from participating in sales and
marketing activities may diminish the effectiveness of an NRSRO’s sales and marketing efforts.
For example, the revenues of an NRSRO may decrease if existing sales and marketing staff lack
the expertise to communicate technical information about the NRSRO’s rating procedures and
methodologies to clients and potential clients. However, as discussed above, the final
amendment does not preclude credit analysts from having these discussions with clients as long
as the analysts do not discuss commercial matters and are not influenced by, for example, any
pressure imposed by clients to produce inflated credit ratings.
The amendments to Rule 17g-5 should have a number of effects related to efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 442 First, these amendments could improve the quality of
credit-related information. As a result, users of credit ratings could make more efficient
investment decisions based on this better-quality information. Market efficiency also could
improve if this information is reflected in asset prices. Consequently, capital formation could
improve as capital may flow to more efficient uses with the benefit of this enhanced information.
These amendments also provide for an exemption based on size, which may decrease the burden
442

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

128

of these requirements on small NRSROs. However, these amendments could still create adverse
effects on competition as exempted NRSROs potentially may be more prone to engage in
“ratings catering” and, thereby, obtain more business as a result. 443 More specifically, exempted
NRSROs may be more likely to produce credit ratings that favor their clients as a result of
allowing persons involved in sales and marketing activities to participate in analytical processes.
As explained above, commenters suggested a number of alternatives to the proposed
amendments to Rule 17g-5. Several commenters suggested that the amendments be less
restrictive. One reasonable alternative suggested by commenters would be for the Commission
not to adopt an absolute prohibition but rather to require an NRSRO to disclose and have
procedures to manage the conflict. 444 This alternative might reduce costs for NRSROs related to,
for example, hiring additional personnel. However, as explained above, the absolute prohibition
was designed to insulate individuals within the NRSRO responsible for the analytic function
from any sales and marketing concerns and pressures. Another less restrictive alternative would
be, as proposed, to adopt only the first prong of the prohibition. This alternative may reduce the
scope of policies and procedures that an NRSRO may need to revise to ensure compliance with
the amendments. However, as discussed above, there are several potential channels through
which sales and marketing considerations could influence credit analysts that would not be
addressed by the first prong of the prohibition. Any less restrictive alternative may reduce the
benefit of improved credit ratings quality if this alternative fails to mitigate conflicts of interest
as effectively as the requirements of the final amendment.

443

As part of its 2012-2013 NRSRO examinations, Commission staff found that four smaller NRSROs did not
have sufficient procedures and controls for separating business and analytical functions or for preventing
rating analysts from being involved in fee discussions and from having access to rating fee information.

129

One commenter suggested a self-executing exemption where an NRSRO would be
automatically exempt if its total revenue falls below a certain threshold. 445 This alternative
would eliminate the need and associated cost for certain NRSROs to apply to the Commission
for exemptive relief. However, this alternative would eliminate the flexibility of the
Commission to tailor exemptive relief. Under the final amendment, exemptions will be granted
on a case-by-case basis, after analyzing the facts and circumstances concerning the NRSRO
seeking the relief. Any exemptive relief granted can be tailored to the specific circumstances of
the NRSRO requesting the relief and include specific terms and conditions designed to mitigate
the sales and marketing conflict. The ability to tailor exemptive relief on a case-by-case basis
will allow the Commission the flexibility to specify conditions that address the conflict in a way
that takes into account the specific circumstances of the NRSRO requesting the relief (including
its size and business model). For this reason, the Commission does not believe it would be
appropriate to establish an automatic self-executing exemption.
Commenters also suggested that the rule not require that the Commission make a public
interest finding to suspend or revoke an NRSRO’s registration for violating a rule issued under
section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act, as this would weaken the enforcement remedy. 446 This
alternative might benefit users of credit ratings by improving the quality of credit ratings. In
particular, NRSROs may have higher incentives to conform to these requirements as a result of a
lower threshold for revoking or suspending their registration. However, this alternative may
result in costs for NRSROs by subjecting them to more frequent suspensions and revocations,
which could reduce the number of NRSROs producing credit ratings. In addition, as stated

445

See Kroll Letter.

See AFSCME Letter; Better Markets Letter.

130

above, among other things, the Commission believes that the public interest finding is
appropriate given the severity of the sanctions.

“LOOK-BACK” REVIEW

Section 932(a)(4) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 15E(h) of the Exchange Act to
add a paragraph (4). 447 Section 15E(h)(4)(A) provides that an NRSRO must establish, maintain,
and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that, in any case in which an
employee of a person subject to a credit rating of the NRSRO, or the issuer, underwriter, or
sponsor of a security or money market instrument subject to a credit rating of the NRSRO, was
employed by the NRSRO and participated in any capacity in determining credit ratings for the
person or the securities or money market instruments during the 1-year period preceding the date
an action was taken with respect to the credit rating, the NRSRO shall: (1) conduct a review (a
“look-back review”) to determine whether any conflicts of interest of the employee influenced
the credit rating; 448 and (2) take action to revise the credit rating, if appropriate, in accordance
with such rules as the Commission shall prescribe. 449
Section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act contains a self-executing provision requiring
an NRSRO to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure that the NRSRO will conduct look-back reviews. 450 The Commission proposed
paragraph (c) of new Rule 17g-8 and proposed adding paragraph (a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 to
implement rulemaking required in section 15E(h)(4)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act. 451 The

Paragraph (c) of New Rule 17g-8

As proposed, paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 provided that the policies and procedures an
NRSRO establishes, maintains, and enforces pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange
Act must address instances in which a look-back review conducted pursuant to those policies and
procedures determines that a conflict of interest influenced a credit rating assigned to an obligor,
security, or money market instrument. 453
Specifically, paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, provided that an NRSRO must
have procedures reasonably designed to ensure that, upon the NRSRO’s discovery that a former
employee’s conflict influenced a credit rating, it immediately publishes a rating action placing
the applicable credit ratings of the obligor, security, or money market instrument on credit watch
or review. 454 Proposed paragraph (c)(1) also provided that the policies and procedures must be
reasonably designed to ensure the NRSRO includes the information required by proposed
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-7 in the form to accompany a credit rating with the
publication of the rating action placing the credit rating on credit watch. 455 Specifically,
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would have required the NRSRO to
452

See paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8, and paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 17g-2. In addition, Rule 17g-8 consolidates
requirements that NRSROs have policies and procedures in a number of areas. As discussed in section
II.F.1. of this release, paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish policies and procedures
with respect to credit rating procedures and methodologies. See paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8. Further, as
discussed in section II.J.1. of this release, paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish
policies and procedures with respect to the use of credit rating symbols, numbers, and scores. See
paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8.

provide in the form published with the rating action an explanation that the reason for the action
is the discovery that a credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument
in one or more prior rating actions was influenced by a conflict of interest and the date and
associated credit rating of each prior rating action the NRSRO currently has determined was
influenced by the conflict. 456
Paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, provided that the NRSRO must have
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it promptly determines whether the current credit
rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument must be revised so that it no
longer is influenced by a conflict of interest and is solely a product of the documented
procedures and methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings. 457 The proposed
approach was intended to ensure that, as soon as possible, the assigned credit rating will become
solely a product of the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings
(that is, no longer influenced by the conflict). 458
Paragraph (c)(3) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, provided that the NRSRO must have
procedures reasonably designed to ensure it promptly publishes a revised credit rating, if
appropriate, or an affirmation of the credit rating, if appropriate, based on the determination of
whether the current credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument
must be revised. 459 Paragraph (c)(3), as proposed, also provided that the NRSRO’s procedures
must be reasonably designed to ensure that information required pursuant to paragraphs

(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii) and (iii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, is included in the form to accompany the
publication of a revised credit rating or a credit rating affirmation. 460 In the case of a revised
credit rating, paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would require the NRSRO
to provide in the form an explanation that the reason for the action is the discovery that a credit
rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument in one or more prior rating
actions was influenced by a conflict of interest, the date and associated credit rating of each prior
rating action the NRSRO has determined was influenced by the conflict, and an estimate of the
impact the conflict had on each such prior rating action. 461 Similarly, in the case of an affirmed
credit rating, paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(iii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would require the
NRSRO to provide an explanation of why no rating action was taken to revise the credit rating
notwithstanding the conflict, the date and associated credit rating of each prior rating action the
NRSRO has determined was influenced by the conflict, and an estimate of the impact the conflict
had on each such prior rating action. 462
As discussed in more detail below, the Commission is adopting paragraph (c) of Rule
17g-8, with modifications from the proposal in response to comments. 463 The modifications
eliminate the requirement to immediately place the credit rating on credit watch or review and
make certain technical changes. The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3) of Rule
17g-7 with modifications from the proposal in response to comments. 464 The modifications

eliminate the required disclosure that would have accompanied the placement of the credit rating
on credit watch, revise the disclosure requirement with respect to estimating the impact of the
conflict, and make certain technical changes. 465
The Commission is adopting the prefatory language to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 as
proposed. 466 Consequently, the final rule provides, in pertinent part, that the policies and
procedures an NRSRO is required to establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section
15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act must address instances in which a review conducted pursuant
to those policies and procedures determines that a conflict of interest influenced a credit rating
assigned to an obligor, security, or money market instrument by including, at a minimum,
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO will take the steps discussed
below. 467
Two commenters stated that the Commission should define what it means for a conflict
of interest to influence a credit rating. 468 One of these commenters stated that any definition
should not require “proof of subjective intent or motivation on the part of the NRSRO employee”
since it would be difficult to discern. 469 On the other hand, two NRSROs stated that the
Commission should not provide a definition. 470 One stated that a finding of influence should
only be required “where the NRSRO determines that, absent the conflict, the NRSRO would
have issued a different rating” because this is the only “influence” that has “practical

published when a credit rating is put on watch or review.

consequences for the users of the affected credit rating.” 471 The other NRSRO stated that any
definition should “include situations where a primary analyst or voting member of a credit rating
committee succeeded in persuading other committee members to agree to a ratings determination
that was inconsistent with the NRSRO’s ratings criteria, procedures and methodologies.” 472
The Commission does not believe it is necessary at this time to define in the rule what it
means to influence a credit rating because the provisions of the rule provide sufficient guidance
in this respect. In particular, the rule provides that the NRSRO must determine whether a
conflicted credit rating must be revised so that it no longer is influenced by a conflict of interest
and is solely a product of the documented procedures and methodologies the NRSRO uses to
determine credit ratings. 473 Thus, the rule contains a standard that can be used for purposes of
making the influence determination required by section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act:
namely, whether the credit rating is solely a product of the documented procedures and
methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings. As one commenter stated, a finding
of influence should only be required “where the NRSRO determines that, absent the conflict, the
NRSRO would have issued a different rating.” 474 The Commission believes that this is an
appropriate framework for assessing whether a conflict influenced a credit rating under section
15E(h)(4)(A). Moreover, it is consistent with the standard to be used in paragraph (c) of Rule
17g-8, as adopted, for determining whether the credit rating must be revised. 475

136

One commenter stated that the rule should require the NRSRO to review whether a
conflict influenced the determination of its rating methodologies or procedures. 476 This
suggestion is outside the scope of the proposal. However, section 15E(h)(1) of the Exchange Act
requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the business of such NRSRO and
affiliated persons and affiliated companies thereof, to address and manage any conflicts of
interest that can arise from such business. 477 Further, Rule 17g-5, among other things, prohibits
an NRSRO from having conflicts of interest unless they are disclosed and managed through
policies and procedures. 478 Thus, the statute and rule cover the conflict that arises when the
prospective employment of an NRSRO’s employee influenced a credit rating methodology (as
opposed to a credit rating). For these reasons, an NRSRO would need to address the conflict
pursuant to section 15E(h)(1) and Rule 17g-5 if it concluded in connection with a look-back
review conducted pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act that the prospect of
future employment inappropriately influenced a credit rating procedure or methodology of the
NRSRO.
One commenter stated that the Commission should specify minimum steps that the
NRSRO must follow to determine if a former employee’s conflict of interest influenced a credit
rating because an “NRSRO’s initial review” to determine whether a conflict influenced a rating
is “at least as important as the process for revising a rating.” 479 One NRSRO stated that the
NRSRO should review credit ratings “upon a discovery that they may have been influenced by a

conflict” but that convening a new rating committee each time a potential conflict is discovered
should not be required because it could impact the timeliness of ratings determinations. 480
These comments address the self-executing provisions of section 15E(h)(4)(A)(i) of the
Exchange Act. 481 The Commission did not propose rules to implement this part of the statute as
the statute itself directly prescribes specific requirements for NRSROs. 482 However, the
Commission notes that the statute requires the look-back review policies and procedures to be
reasonably designed. Consequently, while the Commission is not prescribing by rule how an
NRSRO must conduct a look-back review, an NRSRO must establish, maintain, and enforce
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve the objectives set forth in the
statute.
A number of commenters addressed proposed paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-8, which
would have required NRSROs to immediately publish a rating action placing applicable credit
ratings on credit watch or review based on the discovery that a former employee’s conflict
influenced a credit rating. 483 Several commenters, including NRSROs, stated that the proposed
requirements may cause volatility, confusion, or disruption in the market, 484 and one NRSRO

480

See S&P Letter.

481

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h)(4)(A)(i) (requiring an NRSRO to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure that, in any case in which an employee of a person subject to a
credit rating of the NRSRO or the issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of a security or money market instrument
subject to a credit rating of the NRSRO, was employed by the NRSRO and participated in any capacity in
determining credit ratings for the person or the securities or money market instruments during the 1-year
period preceding the date an action was taken with respect to the credit rating, the NRSRO shall conduct a
look-back review to determine whether any conflicts of interest of the employee influenced the credit
rating).

482

As discussed throughout this section, the Commission is implementing the part of the statute that addresses
the steps to be taken if the look-back review determines that a conflict of interest of the employee
influenced the credit rating. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h)(4)(A)(ii) (providing that the NRSRO must take action
to revise the credit rating, if appropriate, in accordance with such rules as the Commission shall prescribe).

stated that the placement of credit ratings on credit watch may force investment managers to sell
securities, pursuant to investment guidelines. 485 Two NRSROs stated that the NRSRO should be
allowed to determine whether and when to place a credit rating on credit watch, in accordance
with its analytical criteria and procedures. 486 One of these NRSROs stated that mandating that
the NRSRO place a credit rating on credit watch may impact the timeliness of credit rating
determinations and may constitute regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures
and methodologies by which an NRSRO determines credit ratings in violation of section
15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act. 487 Another NRSRO suggested that the Commission “provide a
timeframe for the NRSRO to revise and affirm the rating when a conflict arises” before requiring
it to place the credit rating on credit watch. 488 Several commenters stated that a credit rating
should be placed on credit watch only after the NRSRO determines that a conflict of interest has
influenced the credit rating. 489
The Commission is persuaded that the proposed requirement to immediately place the
credit rating on watch or review could lead to potential market disruption and confusion,
possibly harming investors and issuers, at a time when it is not clear that the credit rating will be
changed. However, the Commission also believes that investors and other users of an NRSRO’s
credit ratings should be notified that a prior credit rating was influenced by a conflict of interest
within a reasonable period of time. As discussed below, an NRSRO must promptly determine
whether the credit rating must be revised or affirmed and promptly revise or affirm the credit

See A.M. Best Letter; AFSCME Letter; DBRS Letter; FSR Letter; Moody’s Letter; S&P Letter. The rule,

rating and include with the publication of the rating action revising or affirming the credit rating
information about the existence of the conflict. In most cases, this process should provide
investors and other users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings with notice of the existence of the
conflict in a timely manner.
However, if there is a delay in publishing the revised or affirmed credit rating, the
Commission believes the NRSRO should provide notice of the existence of the conflict of
interest through another means. Accordingly, paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted, has been
modified to eliminate the requirement to immediately place credit ratings on credit watch or
review based on the discovery of the conflict. 490 Instead, the rule provides that the NRSRO must
place the credit rating on watch or review if the credit rating is not revised or affirmed in
accordance with the rule within fifteen calendar days of the date of the discovery that the credit
rating was influenced by a conflict of interest. 491 This is designed to provide notice to users of
the NRSRO’s credit ratings of the existence of the conflict in a case where the NRSRO delays
publishing a revision or affirmation of the credit rating. However, by prescribing a deadline of
fifteen calendar days, the Commission is not suggesting that an NRSRO can meet its obligation
to promptly revise or affirm a credit rating by waiting fifteen calendar days. As discussed below,
an NRSRO must promptly revise or affirm the credit rating. The question of whether an NRSRO
has met this standard will depend on the facts and circumstances.
Consistent with modifications to Rule 17g-7 discussed below in section II.G.1. of this
release, the Commission is eliminating the related disclosure requirement in proposed paragraph
490

The rule, as adopted, does not preclude an NRSRO from immediately placing credit ratings on credit watch
or review based on the discovery of a conflict if such action is in accordance with the NRSRO’s policies
and procedures.

491

See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of Rule 17g-8. See also Morningstar Letter (suggesting that the Commission
“provide a timeframe for the NRSRO to revise and affirm the rating when a conflict arises” before
requiring it to place the credit rating on credit watch).

140

(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-7 that would need to have been made when the credit rating is put
on watch or review. 492 Instead, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of Rule 17g-8 provides that, if an NRSRO is
required to place the credit rating on watch or review because it did not revise or affirm the credit
rating within fifteen calendar days, the NRSRO must include with the publication an explanation
that the reason for the action is the discovery that the credit rating was influenced by a conflict of
interest.
The Commission is adopting the requirement in proposed paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-8
substantially as proposed, but is redesignating it as paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-8. 493 As
adopted, the final rule requires that the NRSRO’s policies and procedures under section
15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act be reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO will
promptly determine whether the current credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money
market instrument must be revised so that it is no longer influenced by a conflict of interest and
is solely a product of the documented procedures and methodologies the NRSRO uses to
determine credit ratings. 494
In the proposing release, the Commission asked whether the rule should be more
prescriptive in terms of how an NRSRO would be required to determine whether to revise a
credit rating by, for example, requiring an NRSRO to apply a de novo review of the rated
obligor, security, or money market instrument using its rating procedures and methodologies. 495
Three NRSROs stated that the Commission should not prescribe more requirements for how
492

As discussed below in section II.G.1. of this release, the Commission is eliminating the requirement to
publish the form containing the required information about the rating action when an NRSRO places a
credit rating on watch or review.

493

See paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-8. The final rule modifies the proposal by re-designating paragraph (c)(2)
as paragraph (c)(1) because the requirement to place a credit rating on credit watch, which would have been
codified in paragraph (c)(1) under the proposal, is being eliminated.

NRSROs must determine whether a rating must be revised. 496 Two of these NRSROs stated that
doing so may constitute regulating the substance of the credit ratings or the procedures and
methodologies by which an NRSRO determines credit ratings in contravention of section
15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act, 497 and one of these NRSROs stated that the NRSRO “should
retain the flexibility to conduct whatever analysis a particular situation calls for.” 498 On the other
hand, one commenter stated that the Commission should be “more prescriptive in this area” and
“require the NRSRO to apply de novo its procedures and methodologies” to determine whether a
credit rating must be revised. 499 Another commenter stated that it is “essential” to require the
NRSRO to “conduct a de novo analysis of the credit rating using its methodologies and
procedures.” 500 In implementing section 15E(h)(4)(A)(i) of the Exchange Act through Rules
17g-8 and 17g-7, the Commission has sought to strike an appropriate balance between adopting a
measure designed to address the employment conflict with the prohibition in section 15E(c)(2) of
the Exchange Act under which the Commission may not regulate the substance of credit ratings
or the procedures and methodologies by which any NRSRO determines credit ratings. 501 To
strike this balance, the Commission believes that the rule should provide flexibility for the
NRSRO to make this determination by applying procedures and methodologies that it designs to
ensure that the credit rating is no longer influenced by the conflict of interest. Such procedures
and methodologies could but may not necessarily require a de novo review of the rated obligor or
obligation.

Two NRSROs stated that a conflict of interest may impact a number of other credit
ratings, which would need to be revised and published. 502 Accordingly, one of these NRSROs
suggested that the words “immediately” and “promptly” in the proposed requirements be
replaced with “as soon as practicable” given that certain procedures may have to be followed. 503
The other NRSRO suggested that paragraph (c)(2) of proposed Rule 17g-8 include a
“reasonableness standard” for the term “promptly.” 504 A third NRSRO suggested that a
“reasonable amount of time” be given to the NRSRO to “investigate the conflict and determine
whether the rating must be revised.” 505
In response, the Commission believes it is important that the NRSRO not delay
completing the process that it will use to determine whether the credit rating must be revised to
ensure that it is solely a product of the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for determining
credit ratings (that is, not influenced by the conflict of interest). The longer the determination
takes the longer that investors and other users of credit ratings will remain unaware of the
important fact that the credit rating was influenced by a conflict. Consequently, the final rule
retains the requirement that the NRSRO must “promptly determine” whether a credit rating must
be revised. 506 The Commission recognizes that the amount of time necessary to complete the
determination will depend on facts and circumstances, including the number of credit ratings
impacted, the degree to which the conflict influenced the credit ratings, and the complexity of the
rating procedures and methodologies used to determine the credit ratings. 507 However, the

143

Commission expects that in each instance, the NRSRO will complete the process promptly in
order to satisfy the “promptly determine” requirement and that the process, in many cases, will
be expedited by the fact that much of the work to determine the impact, if any, and, if necessary,
revise the credit rating would already be accomplished at the time an NRSRO determines that the
credit rating was in fact influenced by a conflict. In such cases, the Commission would expect
the revision or affirmation, as appropriate, to be issued promptly after the existence of the
conflict was determined. The Commission notes that, as part of the annual examinations of each
NRSRO, Commission staff reviews the policies of the NRSRO governing the post-employment
activities of former staff of the NRSRO.
The Commission is adopting the requirements in proposed paragraph (c)(3) of Rule 17g-8
substantially as proposed, with technical modifications, and is redesignating it as paragraph
(c)(2)(i) of Rule 17g-8. 508 As adopted, the final rule provides that the NRSRO must promptly
publish, based on the determination of whether a current credit rating referred to in paragraph
(c)(1) of Rule 17g-8 must be revised: (1) a revised credit rating, if appropriate, and include with
the publication of the revised credit rating the information required by paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-7; or (2) an affirmation of the credit rating, if appropriate, and
include with the publication of the affirmation the information required by paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii) of Rule 17g-7. 509 As discussed below, the Commission also is adopting the
corresponding disclosure requirements to accompany the publication of a revised credit rating

508

See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Rule 17g-8. The final rule modifies the proposal by re-designating paragraph
(c)(3) as paragraph (c)(2)(i) because, as discussed above, the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g8, as proposed, is being eliminated. In addition, the final rule modifies the proposal by revising the text to
specifically reference the credit rating “in paragraph (c)(1)”.

See paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-8.

144

and an affirmation of a credit rating in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) and (ii) of Rule 17g-7,
respectively, with modifications in response to comments.
One commenter stated that the NRSRO should publish a revised credit rating or
affirmation, as appropriate, “as soon as practicable” instead of “promptly.” 510 As discussed
above, paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted, requires the NRSRO to promptly determine
whether a credit rating discovered through a look-back review to have been influenced by a
conflict of interest must be revised so that it is no longer influenced by the conflict and is solely a
product of the documented procedures and methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit
ratings. Having made the determination, paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted, sets forth
the next steps the NRSRO must take: promptly publish a revised credit rating or an affirmation
of the credit rating and provide users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings information about the
reasons for taking either action. These steps are an important component of the look-back
review process. They are designed to ensure that the NRSRO promptly addresses any impact the
conflict had on the credit rating and alerts the users of its credit ratings about the existence of the
conflict and its resolution. As stated above, failing to act when a conflict has influenced a credit
rating creates the risk that investors and other users of credit ratings will use a conflicted credit
rating when making an investment or other credit-related decision. Thus, paragraph (c)(2) of
Rule 17g-8, as adopted, retains the requirement that the NRSRO must act promptly.
Commenters addressed whether the NRSRO should be required to publish a rating
affirmation, 511 including whether such a requirement would constitute regulating the substance
of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which an NRSRO determines credit

510

145

ratings in contravention of section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act. 512 The Commission does not
expect (and the final rule does not require) an NRSRO to revise a credit rating in every
circumstance in which an earlier rating action was influenced by a conflict of interest. Section
15E(h)(4)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act provides that the NRSRO’s policies and procedures shall
be reasonably designed to, among other things, ensure that the NRSRO takes action to revise the
credit rating “if appropriate.” 513 It is possible, for example, that in the period since the NRSRO
published the conflicted credit rating, events unrelated to the conflict occurred that, when taken
into account by the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings,
would produce a credit rating at the same notch in the rating scale of the NRSRO as the credit
rating that was influenced by the conflict. 514 A requirement that the NRSRO nonetheless revise
the credit rating could interfere with the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for
determining credit ratings in that it would force the NRSRO to change the credit rating assigned
to the obligor, security, or money market instrument to a different notch in the rating scale than
would be the case if the credit rating were solely a product of the NRSRO’s procedures and
methodologies. Consequently, a mandatory revision requirement could, in effect, require the
NRSRO to publish a credit rating that was not consistent with those procedures and
methodologies. Accordingly, the final rule permits the NRSRO to publish an affirmation of the
512

For example, assume that nine months ago an analyst upgraded the credit rating assigned to an issuer’s
securities from the BBB to AA. The analyst leaves the NRSRO to work for the issuer. The analyst’s new
employment triggers a look-back review of the rating action upgrading the credit rating from BBB to AA
pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A)(i) of the Exchange Act. The look-back review determines the credit
rating should not have been upgraded from BBB to AA at that point in time and the analyst’s action in
upgrading the credit rating was influenced by the prospect of employment with the issuer. The NRSRO
performs a de novo review of the credit rating assigned to the issuer by applying its procedures and
methodologies for determining credit ratings. This review – as required by the procedures and
methodologies – takes into consideration favorable financial results the issuer reported three months ago.
Consequently, the process of re-rating the issuer’s securities determines that the current credit rating should
remain AA.

146

credit rating as an alternative to revising the credit rating, if appropriate. As discussed below, the
Commission is requiring that an NRSRO publish an affirmation if the credit rating is not going to
be revised because this will be the mechanism for disclosing the fact that a conflict at one time
influenced the credit rating.
Commenters suggested that if the credit rating is not going to be revised there should not
be a requirement to publish an affirmation. 515 One commenter stated that such a requirement
constitutes regulating the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by
which an NRSRO determines credit ratings in contravention of section 15E(c)(2) of the
Exchange Act. 516 The Commission is not persuaded that the rule should require only the
publication of a revised credit rating. If the rule did not require publication of an affirmation, the
users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings would not learn of the existence of the conflict. One of the
goals of the registration and oversight program for NRSROs is to increase the transparency of
their activities so that users of credit ratings can understand how they operate and can compare
NRSROs. Disclosing the existence of the conflict with the publication of the revised credit
rating or affirmation of the credit rating will provide users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings with
information to assess the adequacy of the NRSRO’s policies, procedures, and controls designed
to manage conflicts of interest and, more generally, the integrity of the NRSRO’s credit rating
process. Moreover, the required disclosures could be useful to users of the NRSRO’s credit
ratings in considering the potential risk of using the NRSRO’s credit ratings to make investment
or other credit-based decisions. Furthermore, in light of the prohibition against regulating the
515

See, e.g., DBRS Letter (supporting the proposed requirement that NRSROs “promptly publish” a revised
rating, but stating that an affirmation of a credit rating that was influenced by a conflict of interest should
be published “only where the NRSRO has determined…to place the existing rating on credit watch”); S&P
Letter (“we also support elimination of proposed Rule 17g-8(c)(3), to the extent that it would require
NRSROs to publish ratings affirmations or other actions following a CreditWatch action required by
proposed Rule 17g-8(c)(1).”).

substance of credit ratings and rating procedures and methodologies in section 15E(c)(2) of the
Exchange Act, the final rule has been carefully tailored to avoid interfering with the NRSRO’s
analytical process. 517 It is the NRSRO that will determine – using its own procedures and
methodologies – whether the credit rating should be revised or affirmed. For these reasons, the
Commission is adopting the requirement to publish an affirmation of the credit rating if the credit
rating does not need to be revised.
The Commission is adopting the disclosure requirements in proposed paragraphs
(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii) and (iii) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications and is redesignating them as
paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) and (ii). 518 Commenters raised concerns about the proposed
requirement to disclose an estimate of the impact of the conflict on each applicable prior credit
rating. 519 One commenter stated that estimating the impact of a conflict on a credit rating may
“create inefficiencies.” 520 A second NRSRO stated that it may be “unduly burdensome,”
delaying publication of a corrective rating. 521 A third NRSRO stated that it would be
“practically impossible” to estimate the impact of a conflict on a prior rating and that the
Commission should not require disclosure of the reasons for revising or affirming a credit
rating. 522

517

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(2).

518

See paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) and (ii) of Rule 17g-7. Because the disclosure requirement with respect to
placing a conflicted credit rating on credit watch is being eliminated, the final amendments modify the
proposed rule text by re-designating paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii) as paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i), and redesignating paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(iii) as paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii). Further, because paragraph (c)(3)
of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, is being re-designated as paragraph (c)(2), the final amendments modify the
references in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii) and (iii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, to refer to paragraph (c)(2)
of Rule 17g-8. The final amendments modify the proposed rule text to make other minor changes to
improve readability.

148

The Commission is persuaded by commenters that precisely quantifying the impact of the
conflict could be difficult and that a more narrative disclosure would be appropriate.
Consequently, the final amendments to Rule 17g-7 require the NRSRO to provide a description
of the impact the conflict had on the prior rating action or actions. 523 The Commission expects
the description to be sufficient to provide investors and users of credit ratings with insight into
the nature of the impact the conflict had on the credit rating. The Commission recognizes that
this may entail a degree of judgment on the part of the NRSRO in terms of estimating the degree
of the impact.
In addition, the text of paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(iii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, has been
modified to reflect that the requirement to place the credit rating on watch and make a
corresponding disclosure has been eliminated. 524 As proposed, this paragraph would govern the
disclosure to be made with an affirmation of the credit rating. The disclosure requirement was
intended to follow the initial disclosure that would have been made when the credit rating was
placed on watch. The initial disclosure would have included an explanation that the credit rating
was placed on watch because of the discovery that the credit rating was influenced by a conflict
of interest. Because this disclosure will not be required, the disclosure that accompanies an
affirmation of a credit rating will need to include an explanation that the reason for the action is
the discovery that a credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument in
one or more prior rating actions was influenced by a conflict of interest. 525 This will provide
context for why the NRSRO is issuing the affirmation. 526

A similar modification is not necessary for the disclosure that must accompany a revised credit rating
because, as proposed, that disclosure would have needed to include an explanation that the reason for the

149

One commenter stated that the rule should require disclosure about the nature of the
conflict. 527 In response, the Commission notes that the rule requires the NRSRO to include with
a revised credit rating an explanation that the reason for the action is the discovery that a credit
rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument in one or more prior rating
actions was influenced by a conflict of interest. 528 Similarly, the rule requires an NRSRO to
include with an affirmation of a credit rating an explanation that the credit rating was influenced
by a conflict of interest. 529 The Commission agrees with the commenter that the disclosure
should provide some context for these explanations. Consequently, the Commission is
modifying the rule text from the proposal to provide that the explanation of the conflict to be
made with a revision of a credit rating or an affirmation of a credit rating must include a
description of the nature of the conflict. 530 For example, the description could disclose that a
former employee was unduly influenced by the prospect of working for the issuer of the rated
security and, as a consequence, did not adhere to the NRSRO’s rating methodology in order to
make the credit rating more favorable to the issuer.
Finally, two commenters stated that information regarding a credit rating influenced by a
conflict of interest should be provided to former subscribers. 531 As discussed above, the
disclosures are required to be made in the form to accompany a rating action under paragraph (a)

action is the discovery that the credit rating was influenced by a conflict of interest, thus providing the
necessary context. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33541. The final
amendments retain this disclosure requirement. See paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-7.

of Rule 17g-7, as amended. 532 This form – as discussed below in section II.G.1. of this release –
must be published in the same manner as the credit rating that is the result or subject of the rating
action and made available to the same persons who can receive or access the credit rating that is
the result or subject of the rating action. 533 This provision thereby accommodates both the
issuer-pay business model in which rating actions generally are made publicly available and the
subscriber-pay business model in which rating actions generally are made available to current
subscribers only. 534 Consequently, if the NRSRO makes its rating actions available only to
current subscribers, former subscribers will not have access to the form and the disclosure it
contains about the conflict of interest. In considering the comments about disclosing the
information to former subscribers, the Commission balanced the interest in providing users of
credit ratings with information about a given NRSRO’s credit ratings with the interest in
promulgating rules that accommodate and integrate with the two predominant NRSRO business
models. For example, since the final amendments to Rule 17g-7 require the disclosure to be
made in the same manner as the disclosure of the credit rating that is the result or subject of the
rating action, a requirement that the disclosure must be made to former subscribers (who
normally would not have access to a rating action that was published after their subscription
expired) would necessarily require a different process for the disclosure. For example, the
disclosure could be made through publication on the NRSRO’s website, but this method of
disclosure may not be effective if former subscribers no longer view the website. Alternatively,
the NRSRO could send the disclosure to former subscribers, but this could be burdensome and

151

present practical difficulties. Because former subscribers are no longer using the NRSRO’s
credit ratings, the Commission believes at this time that it is not necessary to add a requirement
that an NRSRO operating under the subscriber-pay model must make this disclosure to former
subscribers.

Amendment to Rule 17g-2

The Commission proposed adding paragraph (a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 to require NRSROs to
make and retain a record documenting the policies and procedures an NRSRO is required to
establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act and
paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 17g-8. 535 As a result, the policies and procedures would need to
be documented and the record documenting them would be subject to the record retention and
production requirements in paragraphs (c) through (f) of Rule 17g-2. 536 One NRSRO stated that
it “supports the Commission’s proposal to include look-back policies and procedures as records
that an NRSRO must retain under Rule 17g-2(a)(9).” 537 The Commission is adding paragraph
(a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 as proposed. 538 This will provide a means for the Commission to monitor
the NRSROs’ compliance with section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act and paragraph (c) of
Rule 17g-8. The record must be retained until three years after the date the record is replaced
with an updated record in accordance with the amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2
discussed above in section II.A.2. of this release. 539

535

See section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, which requires an NRSRO to make and keep such records, and

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the amendments and new
rule with respect to look-back reviews. 540 The baseline that existed before today’s amendments
and new rule was one in which section 15E(h)(4)(A)(i) of the Exchange Act, added by the DoddFrank Act, required NRSROs to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO conducts look-back reviews in any case in which
an employee of a person subject to a credit rating of the NRSRO or the issuer, underwriter, or
sponsor of a security or money market instrument subject to a credit rating of the NRSRO, was
employed by the NRSRO and participated in any capacity in determining credit ratings for the
person or the securities or money market instruments during the one-year period preceding the
date an action was taken with respect to the credit rating. 541 The Commission staff found during
its 2013 examinations of NRSROs that all NRSROs had established written policies and
procedures to address the look-back requirement. 542 However, the staff found that two larger
and six smaller NRSROs did not consistently, in the staff’s view, conduct adequate look-back
searches or did not have adequate policies governing the searches. 543
Section 15E(h)(4)(A)(ii) provides that an NRSRO must establish, maintain, and enforce
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO will take action to revise
the credit rating if appropriate, in accordance with such rules as the Commission shall

prescribe. 544 Before today’s amendments and new rule, if the NRSRO found, after conducting
the look-back review, that the credit rating was influenced by a conflict, the NRSRO would have
needed to ensure that the credit rating was determined in accordance with the procedures and
methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings. However, the NRSRO was not
required to “promptly” determine whether the current credit rating must be revised or “promptly”
publish a revised credit rating or an affirmation of the credit rating, as appropriate. Further, there
was no requirement that the NRSRO disclose information about the existence of the conflict with
the publication of a revised credit rating, affirmation of the existing credit rating, or placement of
the credit rating on watch or review if the credit rating is not revised or affirmed within fifteen
calendar days of the discovery that the credit rating was influenced by a conflict. Finally, an
NRSRO was not required to make and retain a record documenting the policies and procedures
required under section 15E(h)(4)(A).
The baseline that existed before today’s amendments and new rule was one in which,
pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of Rule 17g-5, an NRSRO is prohibited from issuing or maintaining
a credit rating where a credit analyst who participated in determining the credit rating is an
officer or director of the person that is subject to the credit rating. 545 Also, section 15E(h)(1) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 17g-5 require NRSROs to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to address and manage any conflicts of interest that
can arise from the business of the NRSRO. 546
In addition, section 15E(h)(5)(A) of the Exchange Act requires NRSROs to report to the
Commission any case in which a person associated with the NRSRO within the previous five

years obtains employment with a rated entity or the issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of a rated
instrument for which the NRSRO issued a credit rating during the twelve-month period prior to
the employment if the employee was a senior officer of the NRSRO or participated, or
supervised an employee that participated, in determining credit ratings for the new employer. 547
Section 15E(h)(5)(B) requires that the Commission make the reports publicly available. 548 The
Commission received 244 of these reports between January 24, 2006 and December 31, 2013. 549
One academic study examined these transition reports for three NRSROs (Fitch, Moody’s, and
S&P), which submitted 167 of these reports during that period. 550 The study suggests that the
credit ratings assigned to the future employer by the NRSRO employing the transitioning
employee were more likely to be upgraded and less likely to be downgraded than the ratings
assigned to that future employer by other NRSROs in the year prior to the transition. 551
Relative to this baseline, the amendments and new rule should result in benefits. They
are designed to require the NRSRO to evaluate whether a credit rating has been influenced by a
conflict of interest and, if so, promptly address the conflicted credit rating. This could limit the
potential risk that users of credit ratings might make investment or other credit-based decisions
using incomplete, biased, or inaccurate information. As stated above, the disclosures also will
increase transparency and provide users of NRSRO credit ratings with information to assess an
NRSRO’s ability to address conflicts and to compare NRSROs with respect to their ability to
manage the conflicts. Further, the amendments and new rule – because they are designed to

integrate with an NRSRO’s existing policies and procedures for taking rating actions – could
mitigate potential inefficiencies associated with the requirements. For example, the amendments
and new rule are designed to work within the existing framework of an NRSRO’s policies and
procedures for taking rating actions but not to regulate the substance of the credit rating or the
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings.
The records NRSROs must make and keep under the amendment to Rule 17g-2 will be
used by Commission examiners to assess whether a given NRSRO’s policies and procedures are
reasonably designed and whether it appears that the NRSRO is complying with them.
Recordkeeping requirements are integral to the Commission’s investor protection function
because the preserved records are the primary means of monitoring compliance with applicable
securities laws. 552 Compliance by an NRSRO with its policies and procedures for look-back
reviews and the oversight exercised by the Commission may benefit users of credit ratings by
mitigating conflicts of interest, which may increase the integrity and quality of credit ratings.
Relative to the baseline, the amendments and new rule relating to look-back reviews will
result in costs for NRSROs. NRSROs will need to expend resources to establish, make a record
of, enforce, and periodically review and update (if necessary) the procedures they establish
pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act to ensure they comply with paragraph (c)
of Rule 17g-8. They also will need to develop and periodically modify processes and systems
for ensuring that, if the look-back review determines that a conflict of interest influenced the
credit rating, a revised credit rating or an affirmation of the credit rating is promptly published
(as appropriate) along with the corresponding disclosures required under paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3) of Rule 17g-7, or that the credit rating is placed on watch or review if the credit

rating is not revised or affirmed within fifteen calendar days of the discovery that the credit
rating was influenced by a conflict of interest. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the
Commission estimates that paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 will result in total industry-wide onetime costs to NRSROs of approximately $295,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to
NRSROs of approximately $71,000. 553
Relative to the baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-2 prescribing retention
requirements for the documentation of the policies and procedures will result in costs to
NRSROs. NRSROs already have recordkeeping systems in place to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements in Rule 17g-2 before today’s amendments. Therefore, the
recordkeeping costs of this rule will be incremental to the costs associated with these existing
requirements. Specifically, the incremental costs will consist largely of updating their record
retention policies and procedures and retaining and producing the additional record. Based on
analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 17g-2
and the amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 will result in total industry-wide one-time
costs to NRSROs of approximately $12,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of
approximately $3,000. 554
The amendments and new rule by increasing the scrutiny of the work of former analysts
could potentially decrease the quality of credit ratings in circumstances where the subjective
judgment of participants in the rating process can improve the quality of ratings. In particular, an
NRSRO may establish credit rating methodologies that diminish the ability of analysts to

See section V.C. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). These
costs are derived by monetizing internal hour burdens identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.7. of
this release. The one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding
external costs identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.7. of this release.

exercise subjective judgment in order to minimize the chance that in exercising judgment an
analyst may be influenced by this conflict, which, in turn, will trigger the requirements in the
amendments and new rule, including the requirement to disclose the existence of the conflict. If
the ability to apply subjective analysis is diminished, the credit ratings issued by an NRSRO may
not benefit fully from the expertise of the analysts.
The amendments and new rule should have a number of effects related to efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 555 First, they could improve the quality of credit-related
information. As a result, users of credit ratings may make more efficient investment decisions
based on this higher-quality information. Market efficiency also could improve if this
information is reflected in asset prices. Consequently, capital formation could improve as capital
may flow to more efficient uses with the benefit of this enhanced information. Alternatively, the
quality of credit ratings may decrease in certain circumstances if an NRSRO establishes credit
rating methodologies that diminish the ability of participants in the rating process to exercise
subjective judgment. In this case, the efficiency of investment decisions, market efficiency, and
capital formation may also be adversely impacted if lower quality information is reflected in
asset prices, which may impede the flow of capital to efficient uses. These amendments also will
result in costs, some of which may have a component that is fixed in magnitude across NRSROs
and does not vary with the size of the NRSRO. Therefore, the operating costs per rating of
smaller NRSROs may increase relative to that of larger NRSROs, which could create adverse
effects on competition. As a result of these amendments, the barriers to entry for credit rating
agencies to register as NRSROs might be higher for credit rating agencies, while some NRSROs,
particularly smaller firms, may decide to withdraw from registration as an NRSRO.
555

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

158

There are a number of reasonable alternatives to the amendments and new rule, as
adopted. First, the Commission could require that NRSROs immediately place on credit watch
or review credit ratings that are determined by a look-back review to have been influenced by a
conflict of interest (as was proposed). This alternative might further benefit users of credit
ratings by alerting them sooner of conflicted credit ratings, limiting the potential risk that
investors and users of credit ratings might make credit-based decisions using incomplete, biased,
or inaccurate information, and thereby reduce the risk of mispricing due to the use of such
incomplete, biased, or inaccurate information. It also might increase the incentives of NRSROs
to develop and adhere to rating policies and procedures that further decrease the chance that
conflicts of interest may influence credit ratings. The quality of credit ratings could increase as a
result. This alternative also might decrease the quality of credit ratings in certain circumstances
if it causes NRSROs to further reduce the use of subjective judgment in rating methodologies
relative to the amendments and new rule. This alternative might also result in additional costs
for NRSROs and users of credit ratings. First, the NRSRO would need to expend resources to
develop, modify, and enforce policies and procedures ensuring that it immediately places such
conflicted ratings on credit watch or review in addition to documenting and retaining these
policies and procedures pursuant to the amendments to Rule 17g-2. Second, if a look-back
review determined that a conflict influenced a credit rating, the NRSRO would need to expend
resources to place the credit rating on watch or review. In addition, a number of academic
studies indicate that both stock and bond prices of an issuer react adversely when credit ratings
are placed on negative credit watch. 556 Therefore, this alternative might also create mispricing

159

and confusion in the market. In particular, a placement of a credit rating on credit watch creates
uncertainty in the credit rating that is resolved when the credit rating is either revised or
affirmed. As a result of unfamiliarity, users of credit ratings might not react rationally in the
short term to the uncertainty introduced by placements of credit ratings on credit watch resulting
from look-back reviews. Consequently, this alternative might result in costs for issuers and on
market participants who may make non-optimal investment decisions as a result of mispricing
and confusion. Several comment letters discussed these potential adverse consequences. 557
However, these costs could arise if the NRSRO is required to place the credit rating on credit
watch or review because it does not revise or affirm the credit rating within fifteen calendar days
of the discovery of the conflict.
Other alternatives include those that would apply standards other than acting “promptly”
with respect to the required timing of review and rating actions after a rating is determined to
have been conflicted in a look-back review. For example, an NRSRO could be required to take
these actions “as soon as practicable” rather than “promptly,” as suggested by one commenter. 558
However, the Commission believes it is important that the NRSRO not delay completing the
process that it will use to determine whether the credit rating must be revised to ensure that it is
solely a product of the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings
and to publish a revised credit rating or an affirmation of the credit rating with the required
disclosure of information about the existence of the conflict. The longer the NRSRO takes to

160

complete these steps the greater the risk that investors and other users of credit ratings will rely
on a conflicted credit rating when making an investment or credit-related decision.
Consequently, the final amendment retains the requirement that the NRSRO must “promptly
determine” whether a credit rating must be revised. At the same time, the Commission
recognizes that the amount of time necessary to complete the determination will depend on the
facts and circumstances, including the number of credit ratings impacted, the degree to which the
conflict influenced the credit ratings, and the complexity of the rating methodologies used to
determine the credit ratings. 559
There are a number of other alternatives that would impose additional requirements for
addressing a credit rating that is found through a look-back review to be influenced by a conflict
of interest. One alternative suggested by commenters would be to require a de novo review of a
credit rating that was determined through a look-back review to have been influenced by a
conflict of interest. 560 This alternative could produce higher-quality credit ratings because a de
novo review may provide a higher level of assurance that the credit rating is no longer influenced
by the conflict as the entire rating process would be undertaken (this time without the conflicted
analyst participating). In other words, de novo reviews may be more likely to result in credit
ratings that are in accordance with the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for determining
credit ratings.
On the other hand, this alternative might impose further costs as NRSROs may be able to
conduct a sufficient review without taking all the steps necessary to perform a de novo review
(for example, some of the prior work could have been undertaken by a credit analyst that was not
influenced by the conflict). Requiring a de novo review also may implicate the prohibition in
559

See Moody’s Letter; Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter.

560

See AFSCME Letter; Better Markets Letter.

161

section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act under which the Commission may not regulate the
substance of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any NRSRO
determines credit ratings. 561 Further, this alternative might decrease the quality of credit ratings
in certain circumstances if it caused NRSROs to eliminate or reduce the use of subjective
judgment in rating procedures or methodologies as discussed earlier. In addition, the
amendments and new rule provide flexibility for the NRSRO to make this determination by
applying procedures and methodologies that it designs to ensure that the credit rating is no longer
influenced by the conflict of interest, which could include procedures and methodologies that
require a de novo review of the rated obligor or obligation in all or certain cases.
Commenters also proposed alternatives which would make the amendments and new rule
less restrictive. One alternative suggested by commenters would be to not require publication of
an affirmation after a credit rating has been determined to have been conflicted in a look-back
review if, for example, in the period since the NRSRO published the credit rating, events
unrelated to the conflict occurred that, when taken into account by the NRSRO’s procedures and
methodologies for determining credit ratings, would produce a credit rating at the same notch in
the rating scale as the credit rating that was influenced by the conflict. 562 This alternative could
benefit NRSROs by reducing the potential costs associated with publishing affirmations such as
the cost of composing text to appear in the NRSRO’s publications and press releases. This
alternative also might increase the quality of credit ratings in certain circumstances if not having
to disclose the existence of the conflict caused NRSROs to allow greater use of subjective
judgment in rating methodologies as discussed earlier.

561

562

See DBRS Letter; S&P Letter.

162

However, as discussed above, if the rule did not require publication of an affirmation, it
would result in costs as users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings would not learn of the existence of
the conflict. Disclosing the existence of the conflict with the publication of the revised credit
rating or affirmation of the credit rating will provide users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings with
information to assess the adequacy of the NRSRO’s policies, procedures, and controls designed
to manage conflicts of interest and, more generally, the integrity of the NRSRO’s credit rating
process. Moreover, the required disclosures could be useful to users of the NRSRO’s credit
ratings in considering the potential risk of using the NRSRO’s credit ratings to make investment
or other credit-based decisions in comparison to other NRSROs.

Final Rule

Section 932(a)(8) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 15E of the Exchange Act to
add subsection (p), which contains four paragraphs: (1), (2), (3), and (4). 563 Section
15E(p)(4)(A) provides that the Commission shall establish, by rule, fines and other penalties
applicable to any NRSRO that violates the requirements of section 15E of the Exchange Act and
the rules under the Exchange Act. 564
The Exchange Act already provides a wide range of fines, penalties, and other sanctions
applicable to NRSROs for violations of any section of the Exchange Act (including section 15E)
and the rules under the Exchange Act (including the rules under section 15E). 565 For example,
section 15E(d)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall censure an NRSRO,
place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations of an NRSRO, suspend an NRSRO for

a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of an NRSRO if, among other
reasons, the NRSRO violates section 15E of the Exchange Act or the Commission’s rules under
the Exchange Act. 566 In addition, section 932(a)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section
15E(d) to explicitly provide additional potential sanctions. 567 First, it provided the Commission
with the authority to seek sanctions against persons associated with, or seeking to become
associated with, an NRSRO. 568 The Commission can censure such persons, place limitations on
the activities or functions of such persons, suspend such persons for a period not exceeding one
year, or bar such persons from being associated with an NRSRO. 569 Second, section 932(a)(3) of
Dodd-Frank Act amended section 15E(d) to provide the Commission with explicit authority to
temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the registration of an NRSRO in a particular class or
subclass of credit ratings if the NRSRO does not have adequate financial and managerial
resources to consistently produce credit ratings with integrity. 570 Furthermore, sections 21, 21A,
21B, 21C, and 32 of the Exchange Act provide additional sanctions if an NRSRO violates the
Exchange Act, including the self-executing provisions in section 15E of the Exchange Act, or
rules under the Exchange Act. 571

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 932(a)(3); 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(2). Prior to this amendment, the Commission had
the authority to suspend or revoke the registration of an NRSRO if it failed to maintain adequate financial
and managerial resources to consistently produce credit ratings with integrity. See section 15E(d)(5) of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C 78o-7(d)(5)) before being amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, which re-designated
paragraph (d)(5) of section 15E as paragraph (d)(1)(E) (15 U.S.C 78o-7(d)(1)(E)). Section 15E(d)(2) of the
Exchange Act, however, provides explicit authority to target a suspension or registration revocation to a
specific class or subclass of security. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(d)(2).

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7; 15 U.S.C. 78u; 15 U.S.C. 78u-1; 15 U.S.C. 78u-2; 15 U.S.C. 78u-3; 15 U.S.C. 78ff.
In fact, the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 21B of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78u-2) to provide the
Commission with the authority to assess money penalties in cease-and-desist proceedings under section
21C (15 U.S.C. 78u-3). See section 929P(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

164

In the proposing release, the Commission stated its preliminarily belief that these
provisions of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provide a sufficiently broad
range of means to impose fines, penalties, and other sanctions on an NRSRO for violations of
section 15E of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act. 572 For example, the
fines, penalties, and sanctions applicable to NRSROs are similar in scope to the fines, penalties,
and sanctions applicable to other registrants under the Exchange Act, such as broker-dealers.
Moreover, since enactment of the Rating Agency Act of 2006, the Commission has not identified
a specific need for a fine or penalty applicable to NRSROs not otherwise provided for in the
Exchange Act. Consequently, in the proposing release, the Commission stated its preliminary
belief that it would be appropriate at that time to defer establishing new fines or penalties in
addition to those provided for in the Exchange Act. 573 However, the Commission stated that, in
the future, it may use the authority in section 15E(p)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act if a specific need
to do so is identified. 574
For the foregoing reasons, to implement section 15E(p)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act, the
Commission proposed to amend the instructions to Form NRSRO by adding Instruction A.10. 575
This instruction would provide notice to credit rating agencies applying for registration as an
NRSRO and to NRSROs that an NRSRO is subject to applicable fines, penalties, and other
available sanctions set forth in sections 15E, 21, 21A, 21B, 21C, and 32 of the Exchange Act (15
U.S.C. 78o-7, 78u, 78u-1, 78u-2, 78u-3, and 78ff, respectively) for violations of the securities
laws. 576

Several comment letters addressed the proposal. 577 Most commenters generally
supported the Commission’s proposal to defer establishing new fines or penalties in addition to
those currently provided for in the Exchange Act, 578 with one commenter specifically noting that
it supports the Commission’s proposal to add the new instruction to Form NRSRO. 579
Commenters stated that the fines, penalties, and other sanctions currently applicable to NRSROs
under the Exchange Act are “sufficient,” 580 and that no other additional fines or penalties are
necessary or warranted. 581 However, one commenter suggested that, while other sections of the
Exchange Act provide for appropriate penalties and sanctions, it is not appropriate to consider
suspension or revocation of an NRSRO’s registration under section 21C of the Exchange Act. 582
The Commission is adopting Instruction A.10 to Form NRSRO 583 as proposed. As stated
above, certain commenters agreed that the fines, penalties, and other sanctions currently
applicable to NRSROs under the Exchange Act are sufficient and that additional fines, penalties,
or other sanctions are not necessary or appropriate. Consequently, commenters supported the
Commission’s proposal to add Instruction A.10 to Form NRSRO. While the Commission is
adopting Instruction A.10 to Form NRSRO, it is deferring establishing new fines or penalties in
addition to those provided for in the Exchange Act. The Commission may choose to use the
authority to establish new fines or penalties in the future. 584

Economic Analysis

The final amendments should not create any costs for NRSROs and may provide some
benefits. It could benefit credit rating agencies applying for registration as NRSROs and
NRSROs because it should notify them of the potential consequences of violating provisions of
the Exchange Act and Commission rules.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF
CREDIT RATINGS

Section 932(a)(8) of the Dodd-Frank Act added subsection (q) to section 15E of the
Exchange Act. 585 Section 15E(q)(1) provides that the Commission shall, by rule, require
NRSROs to publicly disclose information on the initial credit ratings determined by the NRSRO
for each type of obligor, security, and money market instrument, and any subsequent changes to
such credit ratings, for the purpose of allowing users of credit ratings to evaluate the accuracy of
credit ratings and compare the performance of credit ratings by different NRSROs. 586 Section
15E(q)(2) provides that the Commission’s rules shall require, at a minimum, disclosures that:
•

are comparable among NRSROs, to allow users of credit ratings to compare the
performance of credit ratings across NRSROs; 587

•

are clear and informative for investors having a wide range of sophistication who use or
might use credit ratings; 588

•

include performance information over a range of years and for a variety of types of credit
ratings, including for credit ratings withdrawn by the NRSRO; 589

NRSRO persistently “issues non-standardized” credit ratings. See CFA II Letter.

The rules in existence before today’s amendments require NRSROs to publish two types of

information about the performance of their credit ratings: (1) performance statistics 593 and (2)
rating histories. 594 The Commission proposed to implement the rulemaking mandated in section
15E(q) of the Exchange Act, in substantial part, by significantly enhancing the requirements for
generating and disclosing this information by amending the instructions to Form NRSRO as they
relate to Exhibit 1 and the disclosure of transition and default statistics, and by amending Rule
17g-1, Rule 17g-2, and Rule 17g-7 with respect to the disclosure of rating histories. 595 The

Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Commission adopt rules requiring an NRSRO
to generate a form to be included with the publication of a credit rating. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s); paragraph
(a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7.

593

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33434. This type of disclosure shows
the performance of an NRSRO’s credit ratings in the aggregate through statistics. Specifically, it provides
the percent of credit ratings assigned to obligors, securities, and money market instruments in each category
of credit rating in a rating scale (for example, AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, and C) that over a
given time period were downgraded or upgraded to another credit rating category (“transition rates”) or
classified as a default (“default rates”). The goal is to provide a mechanism for users of credit ratings to
compare the performance statistics of credit ratings in each category across NRSROs.

594

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33434. This type of disclosure shows
the credit rating history of a given rated obligor, security, or money market instrument. Specifically, it
shows the initial credit rating and all subsequent modifications to the credit rating (such as upgrades and
downgrades) and the dates of such actions. The goal is to allow users of credit ratings to compare how
different NRSROs rated an individual obligor, security, or money market instrument and how and when
those ratings were changed over time. The disclosure of rating histories also is designed to provide “raw
data” that can be used by third parties to generate independent performance statistics such as transition and
default rates.

Commission is adopting the amendments substantially as proposed, with modifications, in part,
in response to comments received.
1.

Amendments to Instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO
a.

Proposal

Exhibit 1 is part of the registration application a credit rating agency seeking to be
registered as an NRSRO must submit to the Commission and that an NRSRO must file with the
Commission, keep up-to-date, and publicly disclose. 596 Section 15E(a)(1)(B)(i) of the Exchange
Act requires that an application for registration as an NRSRO include performance measurement
statistics over short-term, mid-term, and long-term periods (as applicable). 597 The Commission
implemented this requirement, in large part, through Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO and the
instructions for Exhibit 1. 598 Section 15E(b)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the
performance measurement statistics must be updated annually in the annual certification required

596

In particular, section 15E(a)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act requires an applicant to furnish an application for
registration to the Commission, in such form as the Commission shall require, by rule or regulation. See 15
U.S.C. 78o-7(a)(1)(A). Section 15E(a)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act identifies information that must be
included in the application for registration. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(a)(1)(B)(i) through (x). The Commission
implemented sections 15E(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act by adopting Form NRSRO. See Form
NRSRO available at http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/formnrsro.pdf; see also Oversight of Credit Rating
Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 72 FR at 33569-33582.
Section 15E(a)(3) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission, by rule, shall require an NRSRO,
upon being granted registration, to make the information and documents in its completed application for
registration, or in any amendment to its application, publicly available on its website, or through another
comparable, readily accessible means, except for certain information that is submitted on a confidential
basis. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(a)(3). The Commission implemented this provision by adopting paragraph (i)
of Rule 17g-1. See 17 CFR 240.17g-1(i); see also Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies Registered as
Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 72 FR at 33569. Section 15E(b)(1) requires an
NRSRO to promptly amend its application for registration if any information or document provided therein
becomes materially inaccurate; however, (as discussed below) certain information does not have to be
updated and other information must be updated only on an annual basis. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(b)(1); 15
U.S.C. 78o-7(b)(1); 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(a)(1)(B)(ix). The Commission implemented this provision by
adopting Form NRSRO and paragraph (e) of Rule 17g-1. See Form NRSRO; 17 CFR 240.17g-1(e). See
also Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 72 FR at 33567, 33569-33582.

by section 15E(b)(2). 599 Paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 provides, among other things, that the
NRSRO must make the annual certification publicly available within ten business days of
furnishing the annual certification to the Commission. 600
Before today’s amendments, the instructions for Exhibit 1 required the applicant or
NRSRO to provide performance statistics for the credit ratings of the applicant or NRSRO,
including performance statistics for each class of credit ratings for which the applicant is seeking
registration or the NRSRO is registered. 601 The classes of credit ratings for which an NRSRO
can be registered are enumerated in the definition of nationally recognized statistical rating
organization in section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act: (1) financial institutions, brokers, or
dealers; 602 (2) insurance companies; 603 (3) corporate issuers; 604 (4) issuers of asset-backed
599

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(b)(1) and (2). In particular, section 15E(b) of the Exchange Act provides that not later
than ninety days after the end of each calendar year, an NRSRO shall file with the Commission an
amendment to its registration application, in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe: (1)
certifying that the information and documents in the application for registration continue to be accurate;
(2) listing any material change that occurred to such information and documents during the previous
calendar year; and (3) updating its credit ratings performance measurement statistics. See 15 U.S.C. 78o7(b). The Commission implemented these provisions by adopting Form NRSRO and paragraph (f) of Rule
17g-1. See Instruction F to Form NRSRO; 17 CFR 240.17g-1(f). See also Oversight of Credit Rating
Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 72 FR at 33567, 3356933582.

600

See 17 CFR.240.17g-1(i).

601

As used throughout this release, the term category of a credit rating scale refers to a distinct level in a rating
scale represented by a unique symbol, number, or score. For example, if a rating scale consists of symbols
(for example, AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, and C), each unique symbol would represent a
category in the rating scale. Similarly, if a rating scale consists of numbers (for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, and 9), each number would represent a category in the rating scale. Each category also represents a
notch in the rating scale. In addition, some NRSRO rating scales attach additional symbols or numbers to
the symbols representing categories in order to denote gradations within a category. For example, a rating
scale may indicate gradations within a category by attaching a plus or a minus or a number to a rating
symbol. For example, AA+, AA, and AA- or AA1, AA2, and AA3 would be three gradations within the
AA category. If a rating scale has gradations within a category, each category and gradation within a
category would constitute a notch in the rating scale. For example, the following symbols would each
represent a notch in the rating scale in descending order: AAA, AA+, AA, AA-, A+, A, A-, BBB+, BBB,
BBB-, BB+, BB, BB-, CCC+, CCC, CCC-, CC, C, and D. Furthermore, for the purposes of this release,
changing a credit rating (for example, upgrading or downgrading the credit rating) means assigning a credit
rating at a different notch in the rating scale (for example, downgrading an obligor assigned an AA rating to
an AA- rating or an A+ rating).

602

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(i).

603

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(ii).

170

securities (as that term is defined in section 1101(c) of part 229 of Title 17, Code of Federal
Regulations, “as in effect on the date of enactment of this paragraph”); 605 and (5) issuers of
government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign government. 606
In addition, the instructions required that the performance statistics “must at a minimum
show the performance of credit ratings in each class over 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year periods (as
applicable) through the most recent calendar year-end, including, as applicable: historical ratings
transition and default rates within each of the credit rating categories, 607 notches, grades, or
rankings used by the applicant or NRSRO as an indicator of the assessment of the
creditworthiness of an obligor, security, or money market instrument in each class of credit
rating.”
Before today’s amendments, the instructions for Exhibit 1 did not prescribe the
methodology an applicant or NRSRO must use to calculate the performance statistics or the
format by which they must be disclosed; nor did the instructions limit the type of information

604

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(iii).

605

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(iv). The instructions for Exhibit 1 in existence before today’s amendments
broadened this class of credit rating to include a credit rating of any security or money market instrument
issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities transaction. The intent
of the instruction was to include in the class (and, therefore, in the performance statistics for the class)
credit ratings for structured finance products that are outside the scope of the definition referenced in
section 3(a)(62)(A)(iv) of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(iv); Amendments to Rules for
Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 74 FR at 6458. As discussed below, the final
amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 continue to use this broadened definition.

606

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(v). With respect to this class of credit ratings, the instructions for Exhibit 1 in
existence before today’s amendments required the applicant or NRSRO to provide performance
measurement statistics for the following three subclasses (as opposed to the class as a whole): sovereigns,
U.S. public finance, and international public finance. As discussed below, the final amendments to the
instructions for Exhibit 1 continue to require performance statistics for these subclasses.

607

The transition rate is the percent of credit ratings at a given rating notch that transition to another specified
rating notch over a given time period. Only credit ratings that were outstanding at the beginning of the
time period are used in the calculation of the transition rate. Transition rates are generally used to measure
the stability of credit ratings. The default rate is the percent of credit ratings at a given rating notch that
have defaulted over a given time period. Only the credit ratings that were outstanding at the beginning of
the time period are used in the calculation.

171

that can be disclosed in Exhibit 1. 608 Consequently, as stated in a 2010 report of the GAO,
NRSROs at that time used different techniques to produce performance statistics, which limited
the ability of investors and other users of credit ratings to compare the performance of credit
ratings across NRSROs. 609 In addition, several NRSROs included substantial amounts of
information in Exhibit 1 about performance statistics, in addition to transition and default rates.
As noted above, NRSROs have produced and presented performance statistics in various
ways. For example, for the calendar year 2009 performance statistics published by the NRSROs,
some NRSROs used a “single cohort approach” to determine transition rates for their credit
ratings. 610 Under this approach, an NRSRO would calculate transition rates for the most recent
1-year, 3-year, or 10-year period. For example, for its 2009 3-year transition rates for corporate
issuers using the single cohort approach, an NRSRO would calculate transition rates for the class
of corporate issuers for the period December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Other
NRSROs used an “average cohort approach.” 611 Under this approach, an NRSRO would
calculate transition rates for multiple 1-year, 3-year, or 10-year periods and then average them.

608

When adopting Form NRSRO, the Commission explained that the instructions would not prescribe how
NRSROs must calculate transition rates and default rates, noting that commenters had opposed a standard
approach because NRSROs use different methodologies to determine credit ratings. See Oversight of
Credit Rating Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 72 FR at
33574. The Commission stated that it intended to continue to consider the issue “to determine the
feasibility, as well as the potential benefits and limitations, of devising measurements that would allow
reliable comparisons of performance between NRSROs.” Id. The Commission took an incremental step
toward standardizing the disclosure requirements in Exhibit 1 by amending the Form in 2009 to require an
NRSRO to disclose transition and default rates for each class of credit rating for which it was registered
and for 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year periods. See Amendments to Rules for Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organizations 74 FR at 6457-6459.

609

See, e.g., GAO, Securities and Exchange Commission: Action Needed to Improve Rating Agency
Registration Program and Performance Related Disclosures, Report 10-782 (Sept. 2010) (“GAO Report 10782”). Section 7 of the Rating Agency Act required the GAO to review the implementation of the Rating
Agency Act of 2006. See Pub. L. No. 109-291, 7. Among other things, the report evaluated the
performance-related NRSRO disclosures required by Commission rules under the Exchange Act. See
GAO Report 10-782, pp. 24-46.

172

For example, for its 2009 3-year transition rates for corporate issuers using the average cohort
approach, an NRSRO would calculate 3-year transition rates for the class of corporate issuers for
multiple 3-year periods (for example, 3-year periods from 1981 to 2009) and then average them.
Two NRSROs also published “Lorenz curves,” which are “visual tools for assessing the accuracy
of the rank ordering of creditworthiness that a set of ratings provides.” 612 The GAO found that
the variability in how NRSROs produce performance statistics limited the ability of investors
and other users of credit ratings to compare the performance of credit ratings across NRSROs. 613
As described by the GAO, the single cohort approach uses information from the most
recent time periods, while the average cohort approach uses information from multiple time
periods. The GAO stated that the single cohort approach may be useful to predict the
performance of credit ratings under similar circumstances, while the average cohort approach
may be useful to predict future transition rates under different economic and other conditions. 614
The GAO also found that “[b]oth approaches are valid, depending on the needs of the user, but
they do not yield comparable information.” 615
As indicated above, before today’s amendments, the instructions for Exhibit 1 permitted
NRSROs to use differing methods to calculate performance statistics and to include additional
information in Exhibit 1. This created the potential that the presentation of information in the
exhibits would be inconsistent across NRSROs. To address this issue and to implement section
15E(q) of the Exchange Act, the Commission proposed significant amendments to the

612

rating systems or the relative accuracy of a single rating system measured at different points of time for
different cohorts.”).

instructions for Exhibit 1. 616 The proposed amendments would standardize the calculation of the
performance statistics by requiring the applicant or NRSRO to calculate 1-year, 3-year, and 10year transition and default rates for each applicable class and subclass of credit rating using a
single cohort approach. 617 Further, the results would need to be presented in tabular form using a
standardized format (a “Transition/Default Matrix”). 618 Finally, the proposed amendments
would specify that an applicant or NRSRO must not disclose information in the Exhibit that is
not required to be disclosed. 619
Under the proposal, the “issuers of asset-backed securities” class of credit ratings would
be divided into the following subclasses: RMBS; CMBS; collateralized loan obligations
(“CLOs”); CDOs; asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”); other asset-backed securities
(“other ABS”); and other structured finance products (“other SFPs”). 620
As stated above, under the proposal the applicant or NRSRO would be required to use the
single cohort approach to calculate transition and default rates in order to determine the percent
of credit ratings at each notch in the rating scale for a given class or subclass and for the
applicable time period (one, three, or ten years) that were rated at the same notch or transitioned
to another notch as of the end of the period, and the percent of credit ratings at each notch that
were classified as a default or paid off, or had been withdrawn for reasons other than being
classified as a default or paid off during the period. 621 For example, a matrix containing 3-year

transition and default rates for the class of corporate issuers would disclose the number of credit
ratings of corporate issuers the applicant or NRSRO had outstanding as of the period start date
that is three years prior to the most recent calendar year end at each notch in the rating scale used
by the applicant or NRSRO, the percent of those credit ratings that were rated at the same notch
and the percent that transitioned to each other notch in the rating scale as of the end of the 3-year
period, and the percent that were classified as a default or paid off, or had been withdrawn at any
time during the 3-year period. 622
The Commission proposed that an applicant or NRSRO must classify the credit rating
assigned to an obligor, security, or money market instrument as a default if, during the applicable
period, either: (1) the obligor failed to timely pay principal or interest due according to the terms
of an obligation or the issuer of the security or money market instrument failed to timely pay
principal or interest due according to the terms of the security or money market instrument; or
(2) the applicant or NRSRO classified the obligor, security, or money market instrument as
having gone into default using its own definition of default. 623 The applicant or NRSRO would
need to classify an obligor, security, or money market instrument as having gone into default
even if the applicant or NRSRO assigned a credit rating to the obligor, security, or money market
instrument at a notch above default in its rating scale on or after the event of default or withdrew
the credit rating on or after the event of default. 624
As proposed, an applicant or NRSRO would classify a credit rating assigned to an
obligor, security, or money market instrument as paid off if, during the applicable period: (1) an
obligor extinguished the obligation by paying in full all outstanding principal and interest due on

the obligation according to the terms of the obligation (for example, because the obligation
matured, was called, or was prepaid) and the applicant or NRSRO withdrew the credit rating
because the obligation was extinguished; or (2) the issuer of a security or money market
instrument extinguished its obligation with respect to the security or money market instrument
by paying in full all outstanding principal and interest due according to the terms of the security
or money market instrument (for example, because the security or money market instrument
matured, was called, or was prepaid) and the applicant or NRSRO withdrew the credit rating for
the security or money market instrument because the obligation was extinguished. 625
The proposal would require the applicant or NRSRO to determine and disclose the
number of obligors, securities, and money market instruments assigned a credit rating as of the
period start date for which the applicant or NRSRO withdrew a credit rating at any time during
the applicable time period for a reason other than that the credit rating assigned to the obligor,
security, or money market instrument was classified as a default or paid-off. 626 The applicant or
NRSRO would have to classify the credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money
market instrument as withdrawn even if the applicant or NRSRO assigned a credit rating to the
obligor, security, or money market instrument after withdrawing the credit rating. 627
Finally, the performance statistics would need to be presented in a “Transition/Default
Matrix” in a format specified in the instructions, which included a sample matrix. 628

b.

Final Rule

Paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. The Commission is adopting paragraph
(1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 with two technical modifications from the proposal. 629 This
paragraph requires the applicant or NRSRO to provide performance statistics for each class of
credit ratings for which the applicant is seeking registration as an NRSRO or the NRSRO is
registered and for the applicable subclasses of credit ratings listed in the paragraph. 630
Specifically, it requires the applicant or NRSRO to provide transition and default rates for 1year, 3-year, and 10-year periods for each applicable class or subclass of credit rating. 631 It
further requires the applicant or NRSRO to produce and present three separate transition and
default statistics for each applicable class or subclass of credit rating; namely, for 1-year, 3-year,
and 10-year time periods through the most recent calendar year end. In addition, the applicant or
NRSRO must present the transition and default rates for each time period together in tabular
form using a standard format (a “Transition/Default Matrix”). 632

629

See paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. One commenter stated that the phrase “up-to-date
Exhibit 1” as used in proposed paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 was ambiguous. See
Moody’s Letter. Specifically, as proposed, paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 would provide
that the performance measurement statistics must be updated yearly in the NRSRO’s annual certification in
accordance with section 15E(b)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act and paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-1 (in particular, a
Form NRSRO with updated performance measurement statistics – the annual certification – must be filed
with the Commission no later than ninety days after the end of the calendar year). The proposed
instructions also would remind an NRSRO that, pursuant to paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1, the annual
certification with the updated performance measurement statistics must be made publicly and freely
available on an easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s corporate Internet website within ten business
days after the filing and that the NRSRO must make its “up-to-date” Exhibit 1 freely available in writing to
any individual who requests a copy of the Exhibit. The Commission agrees with the comment and is
replacing the phrase “up-to-date Exhibit 1” with the phrase “most recently filed Exhibit 1” as suggested by
the commenter. Further, as proposed, the instructions referenced the “classes and subclasses” for which an
applicant is seeking registration or for which an NRSRO is registered. As discussed in section II.I.1. of this
release, a commenter noted that applicants and NRSROs do not register in “subclasses” of credit ratings.
See DBRS Letter. Paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 has therefore been modified to make this
clear. See paragraph (1) of the Instructions for Exhibit 1.

630

See paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

177

Paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 specifies the classes and subclasses of
credit ratings for which the applicant or NRSRO must produce Transition/Default Matrices, as
applicable. 633 The identified classes reference the classes of credit ratings for which an NRSRO
can be registered as enumerated in the definition of nationally recognized statistical rating
organization in section 3(a)(62)(A) of the Exchange Act. 634 As was the case prior to today’s
amendments, the class of credit ratings enumerated in section 3(a)(62)(A)(iv) of the Exchange
Act (issuers of certain asset-backed securities) is expanded to include a broader range of
structured finance products than are within the scope of the definition in section
3(a)(62)(A)(iv). 635 Moreover, this class has been divided into the following subclasses:
RMBS; 636 CMBS; 637 CLOs; 638 CDOs; 639 ABCP; 640 other ABS; 641 and other structured finance
products. 642

633

See id.

634

Compare 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(i) through (v), with paragraphs (1)(A) through (E) of the instructions for
Exhibit 1. As was the case prior to today’s amendments, paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1
divides the class of credit ratings enumerated in section 3(a)(62)(A)(v) of the Exchange Act (issuers of
government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign government) into three
subclasses: sovereign issuers; U.S. public finance; and international public finance. See paragraph (1) of
the instructions for Exhibit 1.

635

See paragraph (1) of the instructions for Exhibit 1; 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(62)(A)(iv). As was the case before
today’s amendments, the instructions for Exhibit 1 broaden this class of credit rating to include a credit
rating of any security or money market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed or
mortgage-backed securities transaction.

636

The instructions provide that RMBS means a securitization of primarily residential mortgages. See
paragraph (1)(D)(i) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

637

The instructions provide that CMBS means a securitization of primarily commercial mortgages. See
paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

638

The instructions provide that CLO means a securitization of primarily commercial loans. See paragraph
(1)(D)(iii) of the Instructions for Exhibit 1.

639

The instructions provide that CDO means a securitization primarily of other debt instruments such as
RMBS, CMBS, CLOs, CDOs, other ABS, and corporate bonds. See paragraph (1)(D)(iv) of the
instructions for Exhibit 1.

640

The instructions provide that ABCP means short term notes issued by a structure that securitizes a variety
of financial assets (for example, trade receivables, credit card receivables), which secure the notes. See
paragraph (1)(D)(v) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

641

The instructions provide that other ABS means a securitization primarily of auto loans, auto leases, floor

178

Regarding the proposed seven subclasses of asset-backed securities, one commenter
stated that the proposed degree of granularity “would lead to the creation of sparse
Transition/Default Matrices because many NRSROs do not have enough ratings for each
proposed subclass to produce statistically significant results” and that the class of ABS ratings
should be divided into three classes: RMBS, CMBS, and “Other ABS.” 643 Another NRSRO
stated that dividing the class of credit ratings for structured finance products as proposed “would
tend to further increase market transparency” and that the proposed subclasses are “suitable,” but
that “greater stratification may in some cases produce subclasses that are too small to generate
meaningful statistics.” 644
In response, the Commission notes that the reason for dividing the broad class of
structured finance products into these subclasses is to provide investors and other users of credit
ratings with more useful information about the performance of an NRSRO’s structured finance
credit ratings. 645 Each subclass has characteristics that distinguish it from the other subclasses.
Consequently, the separation of performance statistics into these subclasses will provide users of
credit ratings with additional information and allow them to compare the performance of the
credit ratings in each subclass among the NRSROs. Further, the NRSRO must disclose the

plan financings, credit card receivables, student loans, consumer loans, equipment loans, or equipment
leases. See paragraph (1)(D)(vi) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.
642

The instructions provide that other structured finance product means a structured finance product that does
not fit into any of the other subclasses of structured products. See paragraph (1)(D)(vii) of the instructions
for Exhibit 1.

See, e.g., GAO Report 10-782, p. 36 (observing that the various structured finance sectors have risk
characteristics that vary significantly and, therefore, presenting performance statistics for the class as a
whole “may not be useful.”). During the recent crisis, NRSROs assigned credit ratings to RMBS and
CDOs that performed far differently than credit ratings of some other types of securitizations. See, e.g.,
S&P, A Global Cross-Asset Report Card of Ratings Performance in Times of Stress (June 8, 2010).

number of credit ratings outstanding in each subclass at the beginning of the period, so users of
credit ratings will be aware of the number of credit ratings the statistics are based upon.
Paragraph (2) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. The Commission is adopting paragraph
(2) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 with modifications. 646 This paragraph prescribes how the
applicant or NRSRO must present the performance statistics and other required information in
the Exhibit. 647 Specifically, it requires that the Transition/Default Matrices for each applicable
class and subclass of credit ratings be presented in the order that the classes and subclasses are
identified in paragraphs (1)(A) through (E) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.648 In addition, the
order of the Transition/Default Matrices for a given class or subclass must be: the 1-year matrix,
the 3-year matrix, and then the 10-year matrix. 649 Further, if the applicant or NRSRO did not
issue credit ratings in a particular class or subclass for the length of time necessary to produce a
Transition/Default Matrix for a 1-year, 3-year, or 10-year period, it must explain that fact in the
location where the Transition/Default Matrix would have been presented in the Exhibit. 650
The instructions require the applicant or NRSRO to clearly define in Exhibit 1, after the
presentation of all applicable Transition/Default Matrices, each symbol, number, or score in the
rating scale used by the applicant or NRSRO to denote a credit rating category and notches
within a category for each class and subclass of credit ratings in any Transition/Default Matrix

See id. For example, if an NRSRO is registered in the corporate issuer class but has been issuing credit
ratings for only seven years in that class, it could not produce a 10-year Transition/Default Matrix for the
class. Instead, the NRSRO must provide an explanation in the location where a 10-year Transition/Default
Matrix would have been located (namely, after the 3-year matrix) that it had not been issuing credit ratings
in that class for a sufficient amount of time to produce a 10-year Transition/Default Matrix.

presented in the Exhibit. 651 The instructions also require the applicant or NRSRO to clearly
explain the conditions under which it classifies obligors, securities, or money market instruments
as being in default. 652 Further, the instructions require that the applicant or NRSRO provide in
Exhibit 1 the uniform resource locator (“URL”) of its corporate Internet website where the credit
rating histories required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 would be
located (in the case of an applicant) or are located (in the case of an NRSRO). 653
Finally, as proposed, the instructions provided that the Exhibit must contain no
performance statistics or information other than as described in, and required by, the instructions
for Exhibit 1; except that the applicant or NRSRO would be permitted to provide, after the
presentation of all required Transition/Default Matrices and other required disclosures, Internet
website URLs where other information relating to performance statistics of the applicant or
NRSRO is located. 654 This provision was intended to address the fact that some NRSROs
included substantial amounts of information in Exhibit 1 about performance statistics, in addition
to transition and default rates. 655 As discussed in more detail below, some commenters stated
that there are advantages and limitations to using the single cohort approach as compared to the

651

See paragraph (2) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. As discussed in section II.J.2. of this release, the
Commission is implementing section 938(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act through paragraph (b)(2) of Rule
17g-8, which requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to clearly define
each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating category and
notches within a category for each class of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered, including in
Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 938(a)(2); paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-8.

652

See paragraph (2) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

653

See id. As discussed below in section II.E.3. of this release, the Commission is amending Rule 17g-2 and
Rule 17g-7 to enhance the rating histories disclosure requirements currently codified in Rule 17g-2.
Among other things, the amendments relocate the credit rating history disclosure requirements from Rule
17g-2 to Rule 17g-7.

654

See paragraph (2) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. To the extent that an NRSRO wishes to include other
information that it believes is relevant for the purposes of drawing comparisons among credit ratings, the
NRSRO could use an Internet website URL as a channel to provide the reader with additional information
the NRSRO believes to be relevant.

average cohort approach to calculate the performance statistics. 656 While the instructions for
Exhibit 1 mandate the use of the single cohort approach, the Commission believes that, if an
NRSRO also calculates performance statistics using the average cohort approach, it would be
appropriate to disclose that fact in Exhibit 1 and provide an Internet URL where the performance
statistics are located. This will provide additional information to evaluate the performance of the
NRSRO’s credit ratings. For these reasons, paragraph (2) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 has
been modified to provide that Exhibit 1 must contain no performance measurement statistics or
information other than as described in, and required by, the Instructions for Exhibit 1; except that
the NRSRO may provide after the presentation of all required Transition/Default Matrices and
other disclosures:
•

A short statement describing the required method of calculating the performance
measurement statistics in Exhibit 1 (the single cohort approach) and any advantages or
limitations to the single cohort approach the NRSRO believes would be appropriate to
disclose;

•

A short statement that the NRSRO has calculated and published on an Internet website
performance measurement statistics using the average cohort approach (if applicable), a
description of the differences between the single cohort approach and the average cohort
approach used to calculate the performance measurement statistics, and the Internet
website URL where the performance measurements statistics calculated using the average
cohort approach are located; and

•

The Internet website URLs where any other information relating to performance
measurement statistics of the NRSRO is located. 657

understandable to users of credit ratings. 658 This paragraph prescribes the format for a

Transition/Default Matrix and includes a sample matrix.659 Specifically, the prescribed format is
designed to allow the applicant or NRSRO to show in the matrix the number of outstanding
credit ratings in the class or subclass at each notch in the applicable rating scale at the period
start-date, and the percent of those credit ratings that were rated at the same notch at the end of
the period, the percent of those credit ratings that were rated at each different notch in the rating
scale at the end of the period, and the percent of those credit ratings that were classified as a
default or paid off or were withdrawn at any time during the period. 660 The prescribed format
also is designed so that this information will be displayed in Exhibit 1 in a standard manner
across the NRSROs to make it easier for users of NRSRO credit ratings and others to understand
and compare the statistics.
One commenter suggested adding the heading “Status of those ratings at the end of the
time period” to the Transition/Default Matrix because “less sophisticated investors” may not
understand the term “transition,” and also suggested that it may be useful to highlight the box on
the chart that corresponds with the credit rating being at the same notch at the end of the period
as it was at the beginning. 661 The Commission agrees that these types of modifications could
assist users to better understand the information disclosed in the Transition/Default Matrices.
Consequently, the narrative instructions in paragraph (3) and the illustration of the sample
Transition/Default Matrix have been modified to require highlighting of the cell in the matrix
that corresponds with the credit rating being at the same notch at the end of the period as it was

See CFA/AFR Letter. One commenter also suggested that the Commission re-propose the rules and, in
doing so, require NRSROs to present their performance statistics in a way that allows the public to compare
and cross-reference different assets with the same credit rating. See CFA II Letter. The Commission
believes the amendments being adopted today – by simplifying the presentation of the transition and default
statistics and enhancing the rating history disclosures – will make it much easier for this kind of
comparison to be made.

columns represent the status of the credit ratings as of the period start date, the subsequent rating
category columns represent the status of the credit ratings as of the period end date, and the
Default, Paid Off, and Withdrawn (other) columns represent other outcomes that occurred during
the period. 662
As adopted, the sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2 is the sample matrix
provided in the instructions that the applicant or NRSRO must use as a model for its
Transition/Default Matrices.

Paragraph (4) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. The Commission is adopting paragraph
(4) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 with the modifications discussed below. 663 This paragraph
prescribes how the applicant or NRSRO must calculate the performance statistics and enter
information into the Transition/Default Matrices. 664

The final amendments (as was proposed) require the applicant or NRSRO to use the
single cohort approach to calculate the transition and default rates. 665 One NRSRO stated that
the single cohort approach is a “reasonable approach” and “is the best approach as it is, in our
opinion, the clearest way to calculate a meaningful default rate.” 666 Another NRSRO requested
that the Commission provide “fuller background” on decisions such as the determination to use
the single cohort approach rather than an average cohort approach, with a description of potential
benefits and limitations of those decisions. 667 Some commenters suggested that the Commission
use an average cohort approach in lieu of or in addition to the single cohort approach. 668
The Commission recognizes that different methods of measuring the performance of
credit ratings may have unique advantages in terms of the information provided. As the GAO
noted in comparing the single cohort approach and the average cohort approach, “[b]oth
approaches are valid, depending on the needs of the user, but they do not yield comparable
information.” 669 For example, the average cohort approach may provide better information
about how credit ratings perform on average across a wider variety of economic conditions when
compared to the single cohort approach. 670 However, the single cohort approach, because it does
not average out performance over multiple cohorts, may more readily highlight how a given
NRSRO’s credit ratings have performed in more recent economic cycles.

665

See id.

666

See S&P Letter. This commenter also stated that a better way to measure the performance of rating
systems “that do not define their ratings in terms of target default and transition rates” is “a measure of
rank-ordering power, such as the Gini coefficient.”

667

See Kroll Letter.

668

See DBRS Letter (advocating use of the average cohort approach); CFA/AFR Letter (advocating using
both approaches).

669

See, e.g., GAO Report 10-782, p. 28.

670

See section II.E.4. of this release (discussing in more detail the relative advantages of the single and
average cohort approaches).

185

Moreover, the single cohort approach is a simpler approach than the other methods noted
by the GAO and, therefore, it may be easier for less sophisticated investors and other users of
credit ratings to understand how the performance statistics were produced. As stated above,
section (q)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission’s rules shall require that the
performance measurement disclosures be clear and informative for investors having a wide range
of sophistication. 671 The Commission notes that one commenter stated that the single cohort
approach “is the clearest way to calculate a meaningful default rate.” 672 In addition, it will be
easier for NRSROs to produce performance statistics using this approach as it requires simpler
calculations and, consequently, will be less burdensome than the other approaches.
One commenter stated that the single cohort approach could lead to results that are
“significantly more volatile within the shorter time period, which will make interpreting those
results more difficult.” 673 This commenter stated further that “the volatility impact will be
amplified for NRSROs with fewer ratings, which could lead to bias against smaller NRSROs.” 674
The Commission has balanced this concern with the need to prescribe an easy to understand
method for calculating the performance statistics. As discussed below, the requirements in the
instructions for Exhibit 1 provide for very transparent disclosures about the number of credit
ratings in the start date cohort and in the cohort for each notch in the credit rating scale of a given
class or subclass. 675 This transparency will provide persons reviewing the performance statistics
with information to assess how the small number of credit ratings in a given cohort may have

675

See paragraph (4)(A) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 (requiring the applicant or NRSRO to enter into the
second column of the Transition/Default Matrix the number of credit ratings in the start-date cohort for
each notch in the rating scale). This disclosure is illustrated in the first and second columns of the Sample
Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2 (above).

186

impacted the results. 676 Moreover, as discussed above, the Commission has modified paragraph
(2) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 to permit an NRSRO to include a statement about any
advantages or limitations to the single cohort approach the firm believes would be appropriate to
disclose and, if applicable, a statement disclosing that the NRSRO has calculated performance
statistics using the average cohort approach and identifying the Internet website URL where
those statistics are located.
One commenter suggested that NRSROs should be required to calculate performance
statistics using both the single cohort approach and the average cohort approach. 677 One of the
objectives of the amendments is to make the disclosures in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO shorter
and easier to understand. Mandating two sets of 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year performance
statistics (one based on the single cohort approach and one based on the average cohort
approach) for each class or subclass of credit ratings would substantially increase the length and
complexity of the disclosure in Exhibit 1. In addition, it would increase the compliance burden.
However, as discussed above, NRSROs that also calculate performance statistics using the
average cohort approach can disclose that fact in Exhibit 1.
Finally, one commenter stated that NRSROs should be required to use the single cohort
approach for credit ratings of corporate and sovereign debt and a “static pool approach” for
credit ratings of structured finance products. 678 The Commission believes that doing so would
make the disclosure unnecessarily complex and undermine the objective of making the
676

For example, if the outcome for a notch with ten credit ratings is that five were classified as a default
during the period, the default rate reflected on the Transition/Default Matrix for that notch would be 50%.
Similarly, if the outcome of a notch with 5,000 credit ratings is that 2,500 were classified as a default
during the period, the default rate for that notch would be 50% as well. Investors and other users of credit
ratings might conclude that 2,500 credit ratings being classified as defaulting during the period reflects
significantly worse performance than five credit ratings being classified as defaulting during the period.

performance statistics clear and informative for investors having a wide range of
sophistication. 679
For all the reasons discussed above, the final amendments require NRSROs to produce
the performance statistics using the single cohort approach. 680 However, in response to
comments, the Commission is modifying the requirement with respect to identifying the credit
ratings that must be included in a start-date cohort. Several commenters addressed the proposed
requirement that a start-date cohort consist of the obligors, securities, and money market
instruments in the applicable class or subclass of credit ratings that were assigned a credit rating
as of the beginning of the period. One NRSRO stated that “mixing units of study,” consisting of
obligors, securities, and money-market instruments “can create mismatched data and potentially
double counting.” 681 Similarly, another NRSRO recommended that, except for the structured
finance class of credit ratings, the rule should require calculating a senior credit rating for a given
issuer and using that rating in the construction of the cohort, as a single issuer can have many
issuances, and including each one in the cohort may skew the performance statistics. 682 A third
NRSRO stated that for the structured finance category of credit ratings, “the obligations/issues
should be included in the start-date cohorts” because “those transactions do not have obligors in
a traditional sense…” 683 A fourth NRSRO agreed, stating that “the start-date cohorts should be
comprised of obligors for corporate ratings and securities lines for the various subclasses of
structured finance ratings.” 684

188

The Commission agrees with these comments and has modified the instructions. The
final amendments provide that, to determine the number of credit ratings outstanding as of the
period start date for all classes of credit ratings other than the class of issuers of asset-backed
securities, the applicant or NRSRO must: (1) identify each obligor that the applicant or NRSRO
assigned a credit rating to as an entity where the credit rating was outstanding as of the period
start date; (2) identify each additional obligor that issued securities or money market instruments
that the applicant or NRSRO assigned credit ratings to where the credit ratings were outstanding
as of the period start date; and (3) include in the start-date cohort only credit ratings assigned to
an obligor as an entity, or, if the obligor is not assigned a credit rating as an entity, the credit
rating of the obligor’s senior unsecured debt. 685 All other credit ratings outstanding as of the
period start date assigned to securities or money market instruments issued by the obligor must
be excluded from the start-date cohort. 686 For the class of issuers of asset-backed securities, the
start-date cohort (as was proposed) must consist of credit ratings that the applicant or NRSRO
assigned to all securities or money market instruments in the class where the credit ratings were
outstanding as of the period start date, excluding expected or preliminary credit ratings. 687
685

See paragraph (4)(A) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

686

See id. For example, assume an obligor is assigned a credit rating of AA as an entity, and also has
outstanding senior unsecured debt that is also rated AA and subordinated debt that is rated BBB, meaning
there are a total of three credit ratings associated with the obligor. Under the final amendments, the
obligor’s credit rating as an entity must be included in the start-date cohort, and the credit ratings of the
obligor’s senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt must be excluded. Alternatively, if the obligor in the
above example is not assigned a credit rating as an entity, the credit rating of the obligor’s senior unsecured
debt must be included in the start-date cohort and the credit rating of the obligor’s subordinated debt must
be excluded.

687

See paragraph (4)(A) of the instructions for Exhibit 1; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33438. For example, assume a structured finance issuer has ten tranches of
securities and the NRSRO has assigned credit ratings to six of the tranches. All six credit ratings must be
included in the start-date cohort. As stated, “expected” or “preliminary” credit ratings must be excluded
from the start-date cohort. These types of credit ratings most commonly are issued by an NRSRO with
respect to a structured finance product at the time the issuer commences the offering and typically are
included in pre-sale reports. Expected or preliminary credit ratings may include a range of credit ratings, or
any other indications of a credit rating prior to the assignment of an initial credit rating for a new issuance.
Consequently, they should be excluded from the start date cohort since the issuance of the initial credit

189

Finally, as proposed, the start date cohort for all classes of credit ratings must exclude
credit ratings that the applicant or NRSRO classified as in default (using its own definition of
default) as of the period start-date (and, as discussed above, expected or preliminary credit
ratings). 688 As explained in the proposing release, the Transition/Default Matrices should not
include credit ratings of obligors, securities, and money market instruments the applicant or
NRSRO has classified as in default because the firm is no longer assessing the relative likelihood
that the obligor, security, or money market will continue to meet its obligations to make timely
payments of principal and interest as they come due (that is, not default on its obligations). 689

rating is the first formal expression of the NRSRO’s view of the relative creditworthiness of the obligor,
security, or money market instrument.
688

See paragraph (4)(A) of the instructions for Exhibit 1; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33438-33439. The determination of whether the credit rating of the obligor,
security, or money market instrument should be excluded from the start-date cohort would be based on the
definition of default used by the applicant or NRSRO. As discussed below, in determining the outcome of
a credit rating assigned to an obligor, security, and money market instrument during the applicable time
period covered by a Transition/Default Matrix, the applicant or NRSRO will need to use the standard
definition of default in paragraph (4)(B)(iii) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 (as opposed to its own
definition). The use of a standard definition of default to determine the outcome of a credit rating during
the applicable time period could result in a credit rating of an obligor, security, or money market instrument
being included in the start-date cohort that, as of the start date, would be classified as in default under the
standard definition of default in paragraph (4)(B)(iii). This is because the applicant or NRSRO may not
have classified the obligor, security, or money market instrument as in default as of the start date if it uses a
definition of default that is narrower than the standard definition in paragraph (4)(B)(iii). In this case, the
credit rating of the obligor, security, or money market instrument should be included in the start-date cohort
since the applicant or NRSRO, as of the start date, had assigned it a credit rating representing a relative
assessment of the likelihood of default (rather than a classification of default) on the start date. Thus, the
performance of the applicant or NRSRO in rating that obligor, security, or money market instrument should
be incorporated into the default rate shown on the Transition/Default Matrix.

689

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33438-33439. This does not mean
that the obligor, security, or money market instrument will never be reflected in default rates. For example,
assume that as of the date ten years prior to the most recently ended calendar year-end an obligor in the
corporate issuer class was assigned a credit rating of BBB. This credit rating will be included in the startdate cohort for the 10-year Transition/Default Matrix and grouped with the other BBB credit ratings.
Further, assume that during the first seven years of the 10-year period, the credit rating of the obligor was
downgraded from BBB to BB (in year two), from BB to B (in year five) and from B to CCC (in year
seven). Having an outstanding credit rating of CCC in year seven, the obligor’s credit rating will be
included in the start-date cohort for the 3-year Transition/Default Matrix and grouped with the other CCC
credit ratings. Finally assume the obligor defaults in year 8. For the purposes of the 10-year and 3-year
Transition/Default Matrices, the obligor’s credit rating will need to be classified as having defaulted and be
included in the default rates calculated for those matrices. However, because the obligor will be in default
as of the period start date for the 1-year Transition/Default Matrix, it will not be included in the start-date
cohort for that matrix.

190

Consequently, as long as the obligor, security, or money market instrument continues to be
classified as in default there is no credit rating performance to measure. However, if the credit
rating is upgraded from the default category because, for example, the obligor emerges from a
bankruptcy proceeding, the obligor’s credit rating will need to be included in a
Transition/Default Matrix that has a start date after the upgrade. 690
After determining the credit ratings in the start-date cohort, the applicant or NRSRO must
determine the number of credit ratings in the start-date cohort for each notch in the rating scale
used for the class or subclass as of the period start date. 691 The final step is to enter these
amounts, as well as the total number of credit ratings in the start-date cohort, in the second
column of the Transition/Default Matrix. 692
Calculating Transition and Default Statistics
Paragraph (4)(B) of the instructions for Exhibit 1 prescribes how the applicant or NRSRO
must calculate the performance statistics and enter the results into the Transition/Default
Matrices. 693 More specifically, the instructions provide that each row representing a credit rating
notch in the Transition/Default Matrix must contain percentages indicating the credit rating
690

See paragraph (4)(A) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. For example, assume an obligor was classified as in
default by the NRSRO as of the start date for the 10-year Transition/Default Matrix. The obligor’s credit
rating would be excluded from the start-date cohort for the matrix. Assume further that two years later the
obligor emerged from a bankruptcy proceeding after a restructuring. At that point in time, the NRSRO
upgraded the obligor from the default category by assigning it a credit rating of BBB. Assume that three
years later the NRSRO upgraded the obligor’s credit rating from BBB to A- and that it retained that rating
for the next five years. In this case, the obligor must be included in the start-date cohorts for the 1-year and
3-year Transition/Default Matrices.

691

See paragraph (4)(A) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. For the class of credit ratings in the Sample
Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2, this would mean determining how many credit ratings in the startdate cohort were assigned a credit rating of AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, and C as of the start
date. For example, the Sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2 shows a total start-date cohort of
11,770 credit ratings. Within this cohort and as of the December 31, 2000 start date, ten were AAA credit
ratings, 2000 were AA credit ratings, 4000 were A credit ratings, 3600 were BBB credit ratings, 1000 were
BB credit ratings, 500 were B credit ratings, 300 were CCC credit ratings, 200 were CC credit ratings, and
160 were C credit ratings.

outcomes as of the period end date for all the credit ratings in the start-date cohort at that notch
as of the period start date. 694 The instructions also provide that the percentages in a row must
add up to 100%. 695 The final amendments (as was proposed) identify five potential outcomes for
a credit rating in the start-date cohort: (1) it is assigned the same credit rating as of the period end
date; (2) it is assigned a different credit rating as of the period end date; (3) it was classified as a
default at any time during the period; (4) it was classified as paid off at any time during the
period; or (5) the applicant or NRSRO withdrew the credit rating at any time during the period
for a reason other than that the credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market
instrument was classified as a default or paid off. 696 Because the percentages in a row must add
up to 100%, each credit rating in a start-date cohort must be assigned one and only one
outcome. 697
The final amendments (as was proposed) require the applicant or NRSRO to determine
the number of credit ratings in a given notch as of the period start date that were assigned the
same credit rating as of the period end date. 698 The instructions require that: (1) this number
must be expressed as a percent of the total number of credit ratings at that notch as of the period
start date; (2) the percent must be entered in the column representing the same notch; and (3) the

See id. For example, in the Sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2, cumulative outcomes would
need to be calculated for: the cohort of ten credit ratings at the AAA notch; the cohort of 2000 credit ratings
at the AA notch; the cohort of 4000 credit ratings at the A notch; the cohort of 3600 credit ratings at the
BBB notch; the cohort of 1000 credit ratings at the BB notch; the cohort of 300 credit ratings at the CCC
notch; the cohort of 200 credit ratings at the CC notch; and the cohort of 160 credit ratings at the C notch.

695

See paragraph (4)(B) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. For example, in the Sample Transition/Default
Matrix in Figure 2, the outcomes for the ten credit ratings in the AAA category are: 50% remained at the
AAA category, 10% transitioned to the AA category, and 40% were paid off during the period.

cell must be highlighted. 699 An obligor, security, or money market instrument could have the
same credit rating as of the period end date because the credit rating did not change between the
start date and the end date or the credit rating transitioned to one or more other notches in the
rating scale during the relevant period but transitioned back to the start-date notch where it
remained as of the period end date. Consequently, the instructions provide that, to determine this
number, the applicant or NRSRO must use the credit rating at the notch assigned to the obligor,
security, or money market instrument as of the period end date and not a credit rating at any
other notch assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument between the period
start date and the period end date. 700
The final amendments (as was proposed) require the applicant or NRSRO to determine
the number of credit ratings in a given notch at the period start date that were assigned a credit
rating at each other notch in the rating scale as of the period end date. 701 The instructions require
that: (1) these numbers must be expressed as percentages of the total number of credit ratings at
that notch as of the period start date; and (2) the percentages must be entered in the columns
representing each notch. 702 The instructions in the paragraph clarify that, to determine these

For example, in the Sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2, there were ten credit ratings in the AAA
cohort as of the December 31, 2000 start date. Of these ten, five (or 50%) were assigned a credit rating of
AAA as of the December 31, 2010 end date. Accordingly, 50% is entered in the AAA column.

700

See paragraph (4)(B)(i) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. For example, assume an obligor was assigned a
credit rating of BBB as of the start date of a 10-year Transition/Default Matrix. Assume further that three
years after the start date, the credit rating was upgraded to AA but then eight years after the start date the
credit rating was downgraded to A, and nine years after the start date the credit rating was downgraded to
BBB where it remained as of the period end date. For the purpose of the 10-year Transition/Default
Matrix, the outcome assigned to this obligor would be that it had the same credit rating as of the period end
date. However, the transitions that occurred in years eight and nine would be reflected, respectively, in the
3-year and 1-year Transition/Default Matrices for the class or subclass of credit ratings. In other words, the
credit rating history for this obligor would reflect volatility over the short term but stability over the long
term.

numbers, the applicant or NRSRO would need to use the credit rating at the notch assigned to the
obligor, security, or money market instrument as of the period end date and not a credit rating at
any other notch assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument between the period
start date and the period end date. 703
The final amendments (as was proposed) require the applicant or NRSRO to determine
the total number of credit ratings in a given notch at the period start date that were classified as a
default at any time during the applicable time period. 704 The instructions require that: (1) this
number must be expressed as a percent of the total number of credit ratings at that notch as of the
period start date; and (2) the percent must be entered in the Default column. 705
As indicated, the applicant or NRSRO must treat the credit rating as a default if the credit
rating was classified as a default at any time during the applicable period. 706 This is different
from the calculations of the percent of credit ratings that stayed at the same notch or transitioned
Of these 2000 credit ratings, as of the period end date: twenty (or 1%) transitioned to the AAA notch; 780
(or 39%) were at the AA notch as of the period end date; 240 (or 12%) transitioned to the A notch; 200 (or
10%) transitioned to the BBB notch; 160 (or 8%) transitioned to the BB notch; 100 (or 5%) transitioned to
the B notch; and eighty (or 4%) transitioned to the CCC notch. Accordingly, 1% is entered into the AAA
column, 39% is entered into the AA column, 12% is entered into the A column, 10% is entered into the
BBB column, 8% is entered into the BB column, 5% is entered into the B column, and 4% is entered into
the CCC column.
703

See paragraph (4)(B)(ii) of the instructions for Exhibit 1; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33557-33558. As explained above, the applicant or NRSRO must reflect in the
transition rate for a given notch the credit ratings at that notch as of the period end date (rather than any
other credit ratings during the period). For example, in the Sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2,
there were 2000 credit ratings at the AA notch as of December 31, 2000. As of December 31, 2010, 4% (or
80) of the credit ratings were at the CCC notch. The path by which these credit ratings arrived at the CCC
notch as of the period end date could have been through a series of rating actions that occurred during the
ten year period (e.g., being downgraded to A, then BBB, then BB, then B, and then CCC). The credit
ratings during the period, other than the CCC rating as of the period end, must not be reflected in the
transition rate for the AA notch.

Organizations, 76 FR at 33557-33558.

See paragraph (4)(B)(iii) of the instructions for Exhibit 1. For example, in the Sample Transition/Default
Matrix in Figure 2, there were 500 credit ratings in the B cohort as of the December 31, 2000 start date. Of
these 500 credit ratings, seventy-five (or 15%) were classified as having gone into default during the period
(December 31, 2000 through December 31, 2010). Accordingly, 15% is entered in the Default column.

to a different notch in the rating scale that are based on the end-date status of the credit rating. 707
This period-long approach is designed to address concerns that an applicant or NRSRO might
withdraw a credit rating that was classified as a default during the period in order to improve the
default rates presented in the matrix.708
The Commission proposed a standard definition of default to be used to classify credit
ratings as defaults for the purposes of calculating the default rates. 709 The Commission’s goal in
proposing a standard definition was to make the default rates calculated and disclosed by the
NRSROs more readily comparable. 710 The Commission was concerned that if applicants or
NRSROs use their own definitions of default, differences in those definitions could result in
applicants and NRSROs inconsistently classifying credit ratings as in default. 711
A number of commenters addressed the proposed standardized definition of default. One
NRSRO stated that it agreed “in principle that there may be value in having” a standard
definition “so long as allowance is made for ratings that use a term such as ‘default’ in a non-

707

See paragraphs (4)(B)(i) and (ii) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

708

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(q)(2)(C) (providing that the disclosures include performance information over a range
of years and for a variety of types of credit ratings, including for credit ratings withdrawn by the NRSRO).
The following provides an example of how withdrawals can be used to impact a default rate. In the Sample
Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2, the default rate over the 10-year period for the 3600 credit ratings at
the BBB notch is 4%. This means that 144 credit ratings in this cohort were classified as a default during
the period (144/3600 = 4%). If the default rate was determined by the credit rating assigned to these 144
obligors as of the period end date, the NRSRO could withdraw, for example, 100 of these credit ratings
after default. Consequently, only forty-four of the credit ratings would be classified as a default as of the
period end-date and, therefore, the default rate for the BBB notch would be approximately 1.2% instead of
4% (44/3600 = approximately 1.2%).

711

See, e.g., GAO Report 10-782, p. 38 (“NRSROs can differ in how they define default. Therefore, some
agencies may have higher default rates than others as a result of a broader set of criteria for determining
that a default has occurred.”).

standard way.” 712 Another NRSRO stated that the proposed definition of default would fail to
classify as defaults non-payment events on all instruments that legally constitute equity,
including all securitization instruments that use “pass-through” trusts. 713 One NRSRO stated
that requiring an NRSRO to classify a security as having gone into default when the NRSRO
would not choose that classification under its definition “comes dangerously close to the
prohibition against regulating the substance of credit ratings.” 714 This NRSRO also suggested
that the proposed language be modified to clarify that the “terms of an obligation” include any
grace periods within which an obligor or issuer might cure the default. Another commenter
objected to the proposed definition of default, because by incorporating the definition used by
the NRSRO it “defeats the aim of promoting uniformity in the performance data for credit
ratings.” 715
The Commission is adopting a standard definition of default with a modification from the
proposal to broaden the definition to capture certain events identified by one commenter. As
adopted, the final amendments provide that the applicant or NRSRO must classify a credit rating
as a default if any of the following conditions are met:
•

The obligor failed to timely pay principal or interest due according to the terms of an
obligation during the applicable period or the issuer of the security or money market
instrument failed to timely pay principal or interest due according to the terms of the
security or money market instrument during the applicable period;

•

The security or money market instrument was subject to a write-down, applied loss, or
other realized deficiency of the outstanding principal amount during the applicable
period; or

•

The applicant or NRSRO classified the obligor, security, or money market instrument as
having gone into default using its own definition of default during the applicable
period. 716
The first and second prongs of the definition comprise the standard definition of default

that must be used by the applicant or NRSRO. 717 The second prong was added to the definition
in response to a comment that the standard definition of default did not incorporate certain events
generally viewed as defaults but that do not involve failure to timely pay principal or interest,
such as events relating to securitization instruments that use pass-through trusts. 718 The legal
terms of securitizations using pass-through trusts generally do not entitle the certificate holders
to receive a greater amount than is collected by the trust. Therefore, failure to make payments to
certificate holders in excess of the amounts collected would not constitute a payment default as
contemplated under the first prong of the definition.
The second prong is meant to capture events – such as principal write-downs – that are
generally viewed to be defaults on this type of security even though such events do not involve
failure to timely pay principal or interest. For example, a securitization that uses a pass through
trust may experience a write-down of its principal due to losses on underlying collateral backing
the security, if those losses cause the security to become under-collateralized (i.e., the principal
balance of the collateral is less than the principal balance owed to the holders of the security).
Such a write-down results in an immediate loss to the certificate holders since the principal
balance against which interest is calculated has been reduced. This is usually considered a
situation of default for this type of security. The second prong would also capture distressed

(soliciting comment on whether the proposed standard definition of default was sufficiently broad to apply
to most, if not all, events commonly understood as constituting a default).

197

exchanges of preferred stock and other hybrid instruments where the principal amount due to
preferred security holders is reduced, resulting in a loss to the security holders.
In response to the comment questioning whether the Commission should prescribe a
standard definition of default, 719 the Commission notes that one objective of a standard definition
is to avoid a situation in which NRSROs use differing definitions of default, which, as stated
above, could result in some NRSROs using materially narrower definitions in order to produce
more favorable default rates. Moreover, consistent with paragraph (q)(2)(A) of section 15E of
the Exchange Act, the Commission sought to establish a rule that requires disclosures that are
comparable among NRSROs and allows users of credit ratings to compare the performance of
credit ratings across NRSROs. 720 Further, the final amendments do not require that NRSROs use
the standard definition of default in determining and monitoring credit ratings. The amendments
only require that the standard definition be used in calculating credit rating default statistics.
Consequently, the amendments do not regulate the substance of credit ratings or the procedures
or methodologies an NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings. 721
The third prong of the definition applies if the applicant or NRSRO classified the obligor,
security, or money market instrument as having gone into default using its own definition of
default. 722 In response to the comment questioning whether the rule should incorporate the
applicant’s or NRSRO’s internal definition, 723 the objective is to supplement the standard
definition to address a situation in which the applicant’s or NRSRO’s definition of default is
broader than the standard definition. In this case, the NRSRO potentially could classify a rated

obligor, security, or money market instrument as having gone into default during the time period
even though, under the standard definition, the applicant or NRSRO would not need to make a
default classification. As stated above, each credit rating in the start date cohort must be
assigned one of five potential outcomes: (1) it is assigned the same credit rating as of the period
end date; (2) it is assigned a different credit rating as of the period end date; (3) it was classified
as a default at any time during the period; (4) it was classified as paid off at any time during the
period; or (5) the applicant or NRSRO withdrew the credit rating at any time during the period
for a reason other than the credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market
instrument was classified as a default or paid off. If the NRSRO has classified the credit rating
as a default, there is no other outcome other than default that would be appropriate. It would
make the Transition/Default Matrices unnecessarily complex to specify a sixth outcome: that the
NRSRO has classified the credit rating as a default but the standard definition did not. The
standard definition is broad (particularly with the modification discussed above) and should
apply to most cases commonly understood as a default. Consequently, it should rarely happen
that an applicant or NRSRO classifies a credit rating as a default and the standard definition does
not. 724 For these reasons, the definition incorporates the applicant’s or NRSRO’s definition of
default.
The Commission agrees with the comment suggesting that the “terms of an obligation” as
used in the standard definition of default would include any grace period provided in those terms

724

The Commission recognizes that supplementing the standard definition of default with the definition used
by the applicant or NRSRO creates the potential for inconsistent classifications. However, any such impact
will increase the number of defaults for purposes of calculating the performance statistics (that is, the
definition used by the applicant or NRSRO cannot narrow the standard definition). The Commission
believes that the incremental increase in the number of credit ratings classified as default using the internal
definition would be minimal given the broad scope of the standard definition and, therefore, would not
have a material impact on the overall default rates.

199

within which an obligor or issuer may cure the default. 725 Consequently, an applicant or
NRSRO need not classify a credit rating as a default under the standard definition if the obligor
is within a grace period specifically provided for under the terms and conditions of the obligation
and subsequently “cures the default.”
Finally, as proposed, the final amendments provide that a credit rating must be classified
as a default even if the applicant or NRSRO assigned a credit rating to the obligor, security, or
money market instrument at a notch above default in its rating scale on or after the event of
default or withdrew the credit rating on or after the event of default. 726 This is designed to make
clear that the requirement that a credit rating classified as a default at any time during the period
covered by the Transition/Default Matrix must be included in the default rate irrespective of any
post-default rating actions taken by the NRSRO.
As discussed above, the Transition/Default Matrix must provide statistics on the number
of credit ratings in the start-date cohort at a given rating notch that were classified as paid off at
any time during the relevant period. 727 The instructions require that: (1) this amount be
expressed as a percent of the total number of a credit ratings in the start date cohort as of the
period start date; and (2) the percent be entered in the Paid Off column. 728 This classification
must be made if the credit rating is classified as paid off at any time during the period. 729

Id. For example, in the Sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2, there were 200 credit ratings in the
CC cohort as of the December 31, 2000 start date. Of these 200 credit ratings, four (or 2%) were classified
as paid off during the period (December 31, 2000 through December 31, 2010). Accordingly, 2% is
entered in the Paid Off column.

729

See paragraph (4)(B)(iv) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

200

The proposed rule prescribed a standard definition of paid off with two prongs: (1) one
applicable to obligors; and (2) one applicable to securities and money market instruments. 730
One commenter stated that the paid off classification as applied to obligors “is not practicable”
because some obligors do not have rated debt outstanding and it would be difficult to track
whether all obligations of an obligor are paid off. 731 Further, as discussed above, the
determination of the start-date cohorts for classes of credit ratings other than the issuer of assetbacked securities class will require – under the modifications to the proposal – that the applicant
or NRSRO use the credit ratings of obligors as entities and exclude the credit ratings of securities
issued by the obligor unless the obligor does not have an entity credit rating (in which case only
the credit rating of the obligor’s senior unsecured debt must be included). A credit rating of an
obligor as an entity does not relate to a single obligation with a maturity date but rather to the
obligor’s overall ability to meet any obligations as they come due. Therefore, an obligor credit
rating normally cannot be classified as paid off since it does not reference a specific obligation
that will mature.
For these reasons, the Commission has modified the standard definition of paid off to
eliminate the prong that applied to entity ratings of obligors. The final amendments provide that
the applicant or NRSRO must classify the credit rating as paid off only if the issuer of the
security or money market instrument extinguished its obligation with respect to the security or
money market instrument during the applicable time period by paying in full all outstanding
principal and interest due according to the terms of the security or money market instrument (for
example, because the security or money market instrument matured, was called, or was prepaid);

730

731

See S&P Letter.

201

and the applicant or NRSRO withdrew the credit rating for the security or money market
instrument because the obligation was extinguished. 732
As discussed above, the Transition/Default Matrix must provide statistics on the number
of credit ratings in the start-date cohort at a given rating notch that were withdrawn for a reason
other than they were classified as a default or paid-off. 733 The instructions require that: (1) this
amount be expressed as a percent of the total number of credit ratings at a given notch in the
rating scale as of the period start date; and (2) the percent be entered in the Withdrawn (other)
column. 734 The instructions provide that the applicant or NRSRO must classify the credit rating
as withdrawn even if the applicant or NRSRO assigned a credit rating to the obligor, security, or
money market instrument after withdrawing the credit rating. 735
There are legitimate reasons to withdraw a credit rating assigned to an obligor, security,
or money market instrument. For example, an NRSRO might withdraw a credit rating because
the rated obligor or issuer of the rated security or money market instrument stopped paying for
the surveillance of the credit rating or because the NRSRO issued and was monitoring the credit
rating on an unsolicited basis and no longer wanted to devote resources to monitoring it.
However, an applicant or NRSRO could withdraw a credit rating to make its transition or default
rates appear more favorable. 736 The Commission believes that the instructions with respect to

See paragraph (4)(B)(v) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

734

Id. For example, in the Sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2, there were 4000 credit ratings in the
A cohort as of the December 31, 2000 start date. Of these 4000 credit ratings, eighty (or 2%) were
classified as withdrawn for other reasons during the period (December 31, 2000 through December 31,
2010). Accordingly, 2% is entered in the Withdrawn (other) column.

735

See paragraph (4)(B)(v) of the instructions for Exhibit 1.

736

For example, in the Sample Transition/Default Matrix in Figure 2, there were 3600 credit ratings in the
BBB cohort as of the start date. The transition rates from a BBB rating to a lower rating are: 15% (BB),
10% (B), 6% (CCC), 5% (CC), and 1% (C). Taken together, this means that 37% (or 1332) of the credit
ratings transitioned to a credit rating as of the end-date that was below BBB (that is, to categories
commonly referred to as non-investment grade or speculative). An NRSRO could make its performance

202

withdrawn credit ratings permit NRSROs the flexibility to withdraw credit ratings for legitimate
reasons, including those stated above, while helping to prevent manipulation that would make
their transition or default rates appear more favorable.
The Commission did not propose that NRSROs be required to track obligors, securities,
or money market instruments after they had withdrawn credit ratings assigned to them, but the
Commission did seek comment on whether this should be required. 737 Two NRSROs stated that
NRSROs should not be required to track withdrawn ratings after withdrawal. 738 The
amendments, as adopted, do not require NRSROs to track the outcomes of obligors, securities, or
money market instruments after the credit ratings assigned to them are withdrawn.

Amendments to Rule 17g-1

As discussed above, section 932(a)(8) of the Dodd-Frank Act added subsection (q) to
section 15E of the Exchange Act. 739 Section 15E(q)(2)(D) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission’s rules must require an NRSRO to publish the information about the performance
of its credit ratings and make it freely available on an easily accessible portion of its Internet
website, and in writing when requested. 740 The Commission proposed to implement section
15E(q)(2)(D) by amending paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1. 741
Before today’s amendments, paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 required an NRSRO to make its
current Form NRSRO and information and documents submitted in Exhibits 1 through 9 publicly
statistics appear better by decreasing the number of “investment grade” credit ratings that transition to
“non-investment grade” credit ratings. For example, the credit ratings for 400 obligors, securities, or
money market instruments assigned a BBB credit rating as of the start date could be withdrawn. This
would reduce the transition rate of BBB credit ratings to credit ratings below BBB from 37% (1332/3600)
to approximately 26% (932/3600).

ten business days of being granted an initial registration or a registration in an additional class of
credit ratings, and within ten business days of furnishing a Form NRSRO to update information
on the Form, to provide the annual certification, and to withdraw a registration. 742 These
requirements implemented section 15E(a)(3) of the Exchange Act, which provides, among other
things, that the Commission shall, by rule, require an NRSRO, upon the granting of a
registration, to make the information and documents submitted to the Commission in its
completed application for registration, or in any amendment, publicly available on its Internet
website, or through another comparable, readily accessible means. 743
Although section 15E(q)(2)(D) addresses the disclosure of information about the
performance of credit ratings (which NRSROs disclose in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO), the
Commission proposed amending paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 to require an NRSRO to “make its
current Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form NRSRO publicly and freely available on
an easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website” to avoid having separate
requirements for the Exhibit 1 performance statistics and the rest of Form NRSRO and the other
public exhibits. 744 In this regard, the Commission stated that it believed that a Form NRSRO
would be on an “easily accessible” portion of an Internet website if it could be accessed through
a clearly and prominently labeled hyperlink to the form on the homepage of the NRSRO’s
corporate Internet website. 745

In addition, to implement section 15E(q)(2)(D) of the Exchange Act, the Commission
proposed to amend paragraph (i) to provide that an NRSRO “must make its up-to-date Exhibit 1
to Form NRSRO freely available in writing to any individual who requests a copy of the
Exhibit.” 746
Because there were references in Form NRSRO and the Instructions for Form NRSRO to
make Form NRSRO and information and documents submitted in Exhibits 1 through 9 “publicly
available on [the NRSRO’s] website or through another comparable, readily accessible means,”
the Commission proposed amending these references to mirror the text of the proposed
amendment to paragraph (i). 747
Several comment letters addressed the proposal. 748 One NRSRO supported the proposal
as long as it does not require the disclosure of confidential information. 749 Three NRSROs stated
that, as NRSROs are required to make public disclosures in addition to Form NRSRO, a link on
the homepage of their corporate Internet website labeled “Regulatory Disclosures” (or similar
language) to a section of the site that included Form NRSRO would be appropriate and would
still provide easy access to Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9. 750 Two NRSROs stated that
there would be costs but no benefits in requiring that Exhibit 1 be made freely available in
writing to any individual who requests a copy of the Exhibit, and these NRSROs suggested that
NRSROs be able to charge reasonable postage and handling fees. 751

The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1
substantially as proposed. In conformity with the modification (in response to comment) to the
proposed instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, 752 the Commission is modifying the
proposal to replace the phrase “up-to-date Exhibit 1” with the phrase “most recently filed Exhibit
1.” The Commission also is replacing the phrase “Web site” with the word “website,” consistent
with the usage in other NRSRO rules.
The Commission agrees with the comments suggesting that NRSROs may charge
reasonable postage and handling fees for sending a written copy of Exhibit 1 to individuals who
request it in written form. 753 This should reduce the costs of the requirement and incentivize
individuals to access the information using the NRSRO’s Internet website, which is a more
efficient method of obtaining the information.
The Commission also is making conforming amendments to Form NRSRO and the
Instructions to Form NRSRO (as was proposed). 754 Finally, the Commission agrees with
commenters 755 that a Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form NRSRO would be on an
“easily accessible” portion of an NRSRO’s corporate Internet website if it could be accessed
through a clearly and prominently labeled hyperlink labeled “Regulatory Disclosures” on the
homepage of the website.

Amendments to Rule 17g-2 and Rule 17g-7
a.

Proposal

Paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17g-2 requires an NRSRO to make and retain a record that, “for
each outstanding credit rating, shows all rating actions and the date of such actions from the
initial credit rating to the current credit rating identified by the name of the rated security or
obligor and, if applicable, the CUSIP of the rated security or the Central Index Key (“CIK”)
number of the rated obligor.” 756 An NRSRO is required to retain this record for three years
under paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2. 757
Before today’s amendments, paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g-2 (the “10% Rule”) required
an NRSRO to “make and keep publicly available on its corporate Internet website in an
eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”) format” the information required to be
documented pursuant to paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17g-2 for 10% of the outstanding credit ratings,
selected on a random basis, in each class of credit rating for which the NRSRO is registered if
the credit rating was paid for by the obligor being rated or by the issuer, underwriter, or sponsor
of the security being rated (“issuer-paid” credit ratings) and the NRSRO has 500 or more such
issuer-paid credit ratings outstanding in that class. 758 Paragraph (d)(2) further provided that any
ratings action required to be disclosed need not be made public less than six months from the
date the action is taken; that if a credit rating made public pursuant to the rule is withdrawn or
the rated instrument matures, the NRSRO must randomly select a new outstanding credit rating
from that class of credit ratings in order to maintain the 10% disclosure threshold; and that in
756

17 CFR 240.17-2(a)(8). A CIK number has ten digits and is assigned to uniquely identify a filer using the
Commission’s EDGAR system. CUSIP is an acronym for the Committee on Uniform Securities and
Identification. A CUSIP number consists of nine characters that uniquely identify a company or issuer and
the type of security.

making the information available on its corporate Internet website, the NRSRO must use the List
of XBRL Tags for NRSROs as specified on the Commission’s Internet website.
Before today’s amendments, paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 (the “100% Rule”) required
an NRSRO to make publicly available on its corporate Internet website information required to
be documented pursuant to paragraph (a)(8) of the rule for any credit rating initially determined
by the NRSRO on or after June 26, 2007, the effective date of the Rating Agency Act of 2006. 759
The 100% Rule applied to all types of credit ratings (as opposed to the 10% Rule, which was
limited to issuer-paid credit ratings). However, the 100% Rule prescribed different grace periods
for when an NRSRO must disclose a rating action depending on whether or not it involved an
issuer-paid credit rating. For issuer-paid credit ratings, the grace period was twelve months after
the date the rating action was taken, and for non-issuer paid credit ratings, the grace period was
twenty-four months after the date the rating action was taken. The NRSRO was required to
disclose the rating history information on its corporate Internet website in an XBRL format using
the List of XBRL Tags for NRSROs as published by the Commission on its Internet website. 760
The Commission proposed repealing the 10% Rule, significantly amending the 100%
Rule, and codifying the revised 100% Rule in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7. 761 As discussed
below in section II.E.3.b. of this release, these proposals took into account findings by the
GAO. 762 As proposed to be amended, the 100% Rule would incorporate requirements in place
before the proposed amendments and, in addition, would require that an NRSRO disclose rating

history information on an “easily accessible” portion of its Internet website, add more rating
histories to its disclosures, provide more information about each rating action, and not remove a
rating history from the disclosure until twenty years after the NRSRO withdraws the credit
rating. 763
To add more rating histories to the disclosures, the 100% Rule, as proposed, would no
longer be limited to the disclosure of histories for credit ratings that were initially determined on
or after June 26, 2007. 764 Instead, as proposed, the rule would apply to any credit rating that was
outstanding as of June 26, 2007, but the rating histories disclosed for these credit ratings would
not need to include information about actions taken before June 26, 2007. Moreover, in order to
immediately include these credit ratings in the disclosure, the proposals would require the
NRSRO to disclose the credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market
instrument and associated information as of June 26, 2007. The proposals provided that the
rating actions that would need to be included in the history are the initial credit rating or the
credit rating as of June 26, 2007 (if the initial credit rating was prior to that date) and any
subsequent upgrades or downgrades of the credit rating (including a downgrade to, or assignment
of, default), any placements of the credit rating on credit watch or review, any affirmation of the
credit rating, and a withdrawal of the credit rating.
To provide more information about each rating action in a rating history, the proposals
would increase the number and scope of the required data fields. 765 Specifically, the 100% Rule,

209

as proposed, would identify seven categories of data that would need to be disclosed when a
credit rating action is published. The categories of information were:
•

The identity of the NRSRO disclosing the rating action;

•

The date of the rating action;

•

If the rating action is taken with respect to a credit rating of an obligor as an entity, the
following identifying information about the obligor, as applicable: (1) the CIK number of
the rated obligor; and (2) the legal name of the obligor;

•

If the rating action is taken with respect to a credit rating of a security or money market
instrument, as applicable: (1) CIK number of the issuer of the security or money market
instrument; (2) the legal name of the issuer of the security or money market instrument;
and (3) the CUSIP of the security or money market instrument;

•

A classification of the rating action as either: (1) a disclosure of a credit rating that was
outstanding as of June 26, 2007 for purposes of the rule; (2) an initial credit rating; (3) an
upgrade of an existing credit rating; (4) a downgrade of an existing credit rating, which
would include classifying the obligor, security, or money market instrument as in default,
if applicable; (5) a placement of an existing credit rating on credit watch or review; (6) an
affirmation of an existing credit rating; or (7) a withdrawal of an existing credit rating
and, if the classification is withdrawal, the reason for the withdrawal as either a default,
the obligation was paid off, or the withdrawal was for other reasons;

•

The classification of the class or subclass that applies to the credit rating as either: (1)
financial institutions, brokers, or dealers; (2) insurance companies; (3) corporate issuers;
(4) RMBS, CMBS, CLO, CDO, ABCP, other ABS, or another structured finance product
(in the issuers of structured finance products class); or (5) sovereign issuer, U.S. public
finance, or international public finance (in the issuers of government securities, municipal
securities, or securities issued by a foreign government class); and

•

The credit rating symbol, number, or score the NRSRO assigned to the obligor, security,
or money market instrument as a result of the rating action or, if the credit rating
remained unchanged as a result of the rating action, the credit rating symbol, number, or
score the NRSRO assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument as of the
date of the rating action. 766
The proposed amendments specified when a rating action and its related data would need

to be disclosed by establishing two distinct grace periods: twelve months and twenty-four

766

See paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33541-33542.

210

months. 767 In particular, a rating action would need to be disclosed: (1) within twelve months
from the date the action is taken, if the credit rating subject to the action was issuer-paid; 768 or
(2) within twenty-four months from the date the action is taken, if the credit rating subject to the
action was not issuer-paid. 769 These proposed separate grace periods for issuer-paid and nonissuer-paid credit ratings were consistent with the requirements of the 100% Rule prior to today’s
amendments. 770
Finally, the proposed amendments provided that an NRSRO may cease disclosing a
rating history of an obligor, security, or money market instrument no earlier than twenty years
after the date a rating action with respect to the obligor, security, or money market instrument is
classified as a withdrawal. 771
b.

Final Rule

As proposed, the Commission is eliminating the 10% Rule. 772 The 10% Rule did not
permit comparability across NRSROs because it captured only issuer-paid credit ratings in a
class of credit ratings where there are 500 or more such ratings and only if two or more NRSROs
randomly select the same rated obligor, issuer, or money instrument to be included in the
sample. 773 Moreover, the 10% Rule did not produce sufficient “raw data” to allow third parties

to generate independent performance statistics. 774 The goal of the rule was to provide some
information about how an NRSRO’s credit ratings performed, particularly ratings assigned to
obligors, securities and money market instruments that had been rated for ten or twenty years. In
light of the enhancements to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO (discussed above in
section II.E.1. of this release) and the 100% Rule, retaining the 10% Rule would provide little, if
any, incremental benefit to investors and other users of credit ratings in terms of providing
information about the performance of a given NRSRO’s credit ratings. Several commenters
addressed the proposal to eliminate the 10% Rule. 775 All of these commenters supported its
elimination.
The Commission is adopting the amendments to the 100% Rule (including moving its
provisions from Rule 17g-2 to Rule 17g-7) with modifications, in part, in response to
comments. 776 Two commenters generally supported the proposed amendments to the 100%
Rule. 777 On the other hand, one NRSRO objected to the Commission’s proposal to expand the
100% Rule “until a more thorough cost-benefit analysis” has been conducted. 778 This NRSRO
stated that on average only one person per month is accessing its rating history disclosures, but
that it incurs substantial costs to make the information available. Further, it stated that constantly
updating the database for the 100% Rule “would impose an unwarranted burden on NRSROs”
and that the Commission has “substantially underestimated the costs” of the proposal. Another
NRSRO also did not support the proposal, stating that it would impose significant costs on
NRSROs, that lost subscription revenue due to the requirement to provide historical data for free

will limit NRSROs’ ability to innovate, and that industry competition will be undermined,
particularly for smaller NRSROs who may be more dependent on subscription fees. 779
Among other benefits, the modification to the proposal – as discussed below – should address
some of the practical and burden concerns raised by NRSROs.
The final amendments (as was proposed) require that the NRSRO publicly disclose the
rating histories for free on an easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website. 780 It also
broadens the scope of credit ratings that will be subject to the disclosure requirements (as was
proposed). 781 The objective is to require the disclosure of information about all outstanding
credit ratings in each class and subclass of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered but
within certain prescribed timeframes.
In addition to general burden concerns noted above, commenters raised significant
concerns about the proposal to include all credit ratings that were outstanding as of June 26,
2007 and information about credit ratings that is more than three years old (that is, outside the
record retention requirements of Rule 17g-2). 782 For example, one NRSRO stated that it may not

779

See Fitch Letter.

780

See paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17g-7. As discussed above, section 15E(q)(2)(D) of the Exchange Act
provides that the Commission’s rules shall require the information about the performance of credit ratings
be published and made freely available by the NRSRO on an easily accessible portion of its website and in
writing when requested. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(q)(2)(D). The Commission did not propose that the “in
writing” requirement apply to the disclosures of rating histories because such a requirement would not be
feasible. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR 33447, n.264. Consistent with
the proposal, the final amendments do not apply the “in writing” requirement to the disclosures of rating
histories. First, the data file containing the disclosures would need to be updated by the NRSRO as new
rating actions are added. Thus, it would not remain static like the Exhibit 1 performance measurement
statistics, which are updated annually. Consequently, by the time a party received a written copy of the
disclosure, it may not be up to date. Second, the amount of information in the data file would be substantial
(particularly for NRSROs that have issued hundreds of thousands of credit ratings) and would increase over
time. For these reasons, converting the information in the electronic disclosure to written form and mailing
it to the party making the request would be impractical. In terms of utility, as discussed below, the
electronic disclosure of the data must be made using an XBRL format. This is a much more efficient and
practical medium for accessing and analyzing the information rather than obtaining it in paper form.

213

have, or may find it difficult to obtain, the additional information required by the amendments. 783
A second NRSRO that generally supported the amendments also stated that NRSROs may not be
able to provide XBRL information as of June 26, 2007, since those rating actions are beyond the
scope of the 3-year record retention requirement. 784 A third NRSRO stated that – because it does
not consider affirmations, confirmations, placement of credit ratings on watch or review, and
assignment of default status to be credit rating actions and does not subdivide withdrawn ratings
into the subcategories of withdrawn due to default, withdrawn because the obligation was paid in
full, and withdrawn for “other” reasons – it does not capture that information in a format that is
readily retrievable. 785 Consequently, the commenter recommended that the amendment exempt
an NRSRO from providing historical data to the extent it does not already capture the data in a
readily retrievable format.
The Commission is persuaded that the proposal raises legitimate practical concerns (for
example, the additional information may not be available) and would impose a substantial
burden. Accordingly, the final amendments have been modified from the proposal so that an
NRSRO need only retrieve information that is no more than three years old. 786 In particular,
under the final amendments, for a class of credit rating in which the NRSRO is registered with
the Commission as of the effective date of the rule, the disclosure requirement applies to a credit
rating in the class that was outstanding as of, or initially determined on or after, the date three
years prior to the effective date of the rule. 787 Further, for a class of credit rating in which the

See Moody’s Letter (also stating that collecting data for past rating actions would require “tens of

786

See paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of Rule 17g-7.

787

See paragraph (b)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-7. Rule 17g-2 requires certain rating history information to be retained
for a period of three years. See, e.g., 17 CFR 240.17g-2(a)(8).

214

NRSRO is registered with the Commission after the effective date of the rule, the disclosure
requirement applies to a credit rating in the class that was outstanding as of, or initially
determined on or after, the date three years prior to the date the NRSRO is registered in the
class. 788 Consequently, an NRSRO that is registered in a particular class of credit ratings as of
the rule’s effective date will need to begin complying with the rule by disclosing information
about all credit ratings in that class that were outstanding as of the date three years prior to the
effective date or that were initially determined on or after that date, subject to the grace periods
discussed below. After the effective date of the rule, a credit rating agency that becomes
registered with the Commission as an NRSRO or an NRSRO that adds a class of credit ratings to
its NRSRO registration will need to begin complying with the rule by disclosing information
about all credit ratings in the classes for which it is registered that were outstanding as of the date
three years prior to the registration date or that were initially determined on or after that date,
subject to the grace periods. This aligns the retrieval requirement for all NRSROs regardless of
when they are registered in a class of credit ratings. 789 It also substantially reduces the burden of
adding past rating actions to the rating histories because the NRSRO will need to provide only
three years of historical information initially, which should mitigate, to some degree, concerns
about having to retrieve information that was not retained by the NRSRO. 790

788

See paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of Rule 17g-7.

789

For example, under the proposal, NRSROs registered with the Commission in a class of credit ratings when
the rule went effective would need to have retrieved information about the credit ratings in that class
covering a period from June 26, 2007 to the effective date of the rule. The span of time between June 26,
2007 and the effective date of the rule would be fixed at that point and all NRSROs registered in one or
more classes of securities on the effective date would need to retrieve information spanning the same
period of time. However, any NRSRO registered after the effective date, or an NRSRO adding a class of
credit ratings to its registration after the effective date, would to need retrieve information spanning a
longer period of time and, as time progressed, the retrieval period would increase as would the burden of
retrieval.

790

As indicated above, one commenter recommended that the rule exempt an NRSRO from providing
historical data to the extent it does not already capture the data in a readily retrievable format. See
Moody’s Letter. While the Commission believes the modifications discussed above will address the

215

Under the proposal, if a credit rating was added to the rating histories disclosure either
because it was outstanding as of June 26, 2007 or was initially determined on or after that date,
the rating history for the credit rating needed to include every subsequent upgrade or downgrade
of the credit rating (including a downgrade to, or assignment of, default), any placements of the
credit rating on credit watch or review, any affirmation of the credit rating, and a withdrawal of
the credit rating. 791 Several commenters raised concerns about the proposed types of rating
actions that would trigger the disclosure requirements, including rating affirmations. 792 One
NRSRO suggested that the disclosure rules apply only to initial ratings because subscriptionbased NRSROs will likely have significantly more rating actions, and the proposed rule may
encourage these NRSROs to provide less frequent surveillance. 793 Another commenter stated
that a rating affirmation should not be included in rating actions as the required disclosures may
make NRSROs less likely to provide confirmations of credit ratings, which may make it
impossible to amend transaction documents. 794 An NRSRO stated that including affirmations in
rating actions would significantly increase the burden on NRSROs. 795 The commenter
recommended that if affirmations were included, the Commission should state that the term
affirmation refers only to a published announcement, or written communication in the case of a
private or confidential credit rating, by an NRSRO that it is maintaining the credit rating at its

commenter’s concerns to a large degree, an NRSRO can seek exemptive relief from the Commission under
section 36 of the Exchange Act. See 17 U.S.C. 78mm.

current level, and that the term should not include any purely internal discussions by an NRSRO
about a credit rating.
The Commission is persuaded by the comments that the types of rating actions triggering
the disclosure requirement can be reduced and the 100% Rule can still meet the objective of
allowing users of credit ratings and others to compare the performance of credit ratings among
NRSROs and generate their own performance statistics. Consequently, to focus the disclosure
on the rating actions that are most relevant to evaluating performance, the final amendments
provide that the history of a credit rating must include, in addition to the initial credit rating or
the initial entry of the credit rating into the history, any subsequent upgrade or downgrade of the
credit rating (including a downgrade to, or assignment of, default) and a withdrawal of the credit
rating. 796 These are the rating actions necessary to calculate transition and default rates. With
this modification, the final amendments eliminate the requirement to include placements on
watch and affirmations (and the required data associated with those actions) in the rating
histories. In addition to reducing the burden of the rule, this may alleviate concerns that
requiring NRSROs to disclose rating histories (even with the grace periods) may cause
subscribers to stop paying for access to credit ratings or for downloads of credit rating actions
and instead to use the disclosures of rating histories as a substitute for these types of
subscriptions. For example, information about placements of credit ratings on watch and credit
rating affirmations may be information that subscribers value as part of their subscriptions.
The final amendments (as was proposed) increase the information that must be disclosed
about a rating action. 797 Specifically, paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-7 specifies seven categories

796

See paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of Rule 17g-7.

797

See paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-7.

217

of data that must be disclosed with a rating action. 798 The objective of these enhancements is to
make the disclosures more useful in terms of the amount of information provided, the ability to
search and sort the information, and the ability to compare historical rating information across
NRSROs. 799 As discussed below, the Commission has made some modifications to the required
data categories in response to suggestions by commenters and to correspond to the modifications
discussed above that change the scope of the credit ratings and rating actions covered by the
disclosure requirement.
Paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of Rule 17g-7 are being adopted as proposed. 800 Paragraph
(b)(2)(i) identifies the first category of data that must be disclosed with each rating action: the
identity of the NRSRO disclosing the rating action. 801 Because the NRSRO must assign an
XBRL Tag to each item of information, including and tagging the identity of the NRSRO will
assist users who download and combine data files of multiple NRSROs to sort credit ratings by a
given NRSRO. Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) identifies the second category of data: the date of the rating
action. 802 This will allow a person reviewing the credit rating histories of the NRSROs to reach
conclusions about their relative capabilities in making appropriate and timely adjustments to
their credit ratings. 803

798

The Commission will update the List of XBRL Tags to include some of the new data fields. Other fields
are covered by existing Tags, including by some of the voluntary Tags.

799

See, e.g., GAO Report 10-782, p. 41 (“First, SEC [sic] did not specify the data fields the NRSROs were to
disclose in the rule, and the data fields provided by the NRSROs were not always sufficient to identify a
complete rating history for ratings in each of the seven samples. If users cannot identify the rating history
for each rating in the sample, they cannot develop performance measures that track how an issuer’s credit
rating evolves.”).

Paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would identify the third category of data
that must be disclosed: (1) the CIK number of the rated obligor; and (2) the name of the
obligor. 804 Under the proposal, the information in this category would need to be disclosed only
if the rating action is taken with respect to a credit rating of an obligor as an entity (as opposed to
a credit rating of a security or money market instrument). 805
Commenters raised concerns about requiring disclosure of the CIK number. 806 One
NRSRO questioned the cost-effectiveness of the requirement and recommended that the
requirement to provide CIK numbers be eliminated. 807 Another NRSRO stated that it was
“unnecessarily burdensome” to require the use of identifiers that may become obsolete, that
require NRSROs to pay a fee, or that may not be used outside the United States, as long as
NRSROs “use some kind of identifier system sufficient to identify the rated obligor and
obligation,” for example, “an internationally recognized LEI [Legal Entity Identifier] system.” 808
The Commission believes that the use of an LEI can promote accuracy and
standardization of NRSRO data, and therefore can further the purpose of allowing users of credit
ratings to compare the performance of credit ratings by different NRSROs. 809 The effort to

809

The Commission has prescribed the use of an LEI for the purposes of reporting information on Form PF.
See Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and
Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF, Investment Adviser Act of 1940 Release No. 3308 (Oct. 31,
2011), 76 FR 71128 (Nov. 16, 2011). Form PF is available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2011/ia-3308formpf.pdf. The glossary of terms for the form provides the following definition of LEI: “With respect to
any company, the ‘legal entity identifier’ assigned by or on behalf of an internationally recognized
standards setting body and required for reporting purposes by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office
of Financial Research or a financial regulator. In the case of a financial institution, if a ‘legal entity

standardize a universal LEI has progressed significantly over the last few years, and an
international standard was published by the International Organization for Standardization
(“ISO”) in June 2012, which set out the elements of a working system. 810
The Commission is modifying the proposal to require, with respect to a rating action
involving a credit rating of an obligor as an entity, the disclosure of the obligor’s LEI issued by a
utility endorsed or otherwise governed by the Global LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee 811 or the
Global LEI Foundation, if available, or, if the LEI is not available, the disclosure of the obligor’s

CIK, if available. 812 The Commission believes that having some method of identifying the
obligor – in addition to its name – is appropriate as it will make the data searchable and
comparable across NRSROs. Coded identifiers like the LEI and CIK will add a level of
standardization to the credit rating history data, making for easier electronic querying and
processing.
An NRSRO recommended not requiring inclusion of the legal name of the issuer because
inconsistent use of abbreviations has made this problematic. 813 The Commission believes that
the name of the obligor provides a more intuitive means of searching for a specific credit rating
identifier’ has not been assigned, then provide the RSSD ID assigned by the National Information Center of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, if any.”

See paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of Rule 17g-7. The proposal is modified by separating the LEI and CIK
disclosure requirements in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) and the legal name disclosure requirement in paragraph
(b)(2)(iii)(B). See paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of Rule 17g-7. While the description of the LEI in
Rule 17g-7 is different than the description in the glossary of terms for Form PF, it is intended to have the
same meaning. The description in Rule 17g-7 is designed to be more generic and, therefore, address future
changes in the organizations administering LEIs.

history in comparison to the LEI or CIK number. The Commission does not, however, view the
LEI or CIK as a replacement for a name. For example, the user of the data can search for the
name if the user does not know the LEI or CIK number. The Commission agrees with the
commenter that requiring the specific legal name can be problematic. Consequently, the
proposal has been modified to require the NRSRO to provide the obligor’s “name” rather than
“legal name.” 814 An NRSRO must disclose a name that clearly identifies the obligor and use
that name consistently. 815 For these reasons, the final amendments require the disclosure of the
obligor’s name. 816
Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would identify the fourth category of
data to be disclosed with a rating action: (1) the CIK number of the issuer of the security or
money market instrument; (2) the name of the issuer of the security or money market instrument;
and (3) the CUSIP of the security or money market instrument. 817 The information in this
category would need to be disclosed when the rating action is taken with respect to a security or
money market instrument. The Commission is adopting paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of Rule 17g-7 with
modifications from the proposal.
First, the paragraph requires an NRSRO to disclose the LEI of the issuer, if available, or,
if an LEI is not available, the CIK number of the issuer, if available. 818 This will make
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) consistent with paragraph (b)(2)(iii), which, as discussed above, requires the
disclosure of the LEI of the obligor, if available, or, if an LEI is not available, the CIK number of
814

See paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of Rule 17g-7.

815

As discussed below in section II.G.3. of this release, the Commission is taking a similar approach to the
identification of the obligor’s name in the form to accompany a credit rating.

the issuer, if available. Second, as adopted, the paragraph requires the NRSRO to disclose the
“name” of the issuer, rather than the “legal name” as was proposed. 819 This also will make
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) consistent with paragraph (b)(2)(iii).
The Commission is adopting the requirement to disclose the CUSIP of the security or
money market instrument as was proposed. 820 One NRSRO stated that the cost of adding CUSIP
data should be included in the Commission’s cost-benefit analysis. 821 In response, the
Commission notes that the requirement to disclose the CUSIP of the security or money market
instrument was required by the 100% Rule before today’s amendments. 822 When adopting the
10% Rule and the 100% Rule, the Commission considered the costs associated with the CUSIP
requirement. 823 The Commission recognizes that the continued requirement to disclose the
CUSIP number of the security or money market instrument subject to the rating action imposes
licensing costs. However, without the CUSIP requirement, the disclosures could be of little
utility as there would be no standard identifier with which to search for a specific security or
money market instrument. This would make it difficult for users of the rating history disclosures
to locate and compare the rating history for a given security or money market instrument. The
Commission has balanced the cost of the requirement with the benefit of making the disclosures
readily searchable and, therefore, enhancing their utility. For these reasons, the final
amendments retain the CUSIP disclosure requirements. 824

If securities or money market instruments are assigned LEIs, the Commission would consider replacing the
CUSIP requirement with an LEI requirement.

222

Paragraph (b)(2)(v) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would identify the fifth category of data
to be disclosed with a rating action: a classification of the type of rating action. 825 Under the
proposal, the NRSRO would be required to select one of seven classifications to identify the type
of rating action. 826 In particular, the seven possible classifications were:
•

A disclosure of a credit rating that was outstanding as of June 26, 2007; 827

•

An initial credit rating; 828

•

An upgrade of an existing credit rating; 829

•

A downgrade of an existing credit rating, which would include classifying the obligor,
security, or money market instrument as in default, if applicable; 830

•

A placement of an existing credit rating on credit watch or review; 831

•

An affirmation of an existing credit rating; 832 or

825

See paragraph (b)(2)(v) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations.

826

The required disclosure would need to be the type of rating action and not the credit rating resulting from
the rating action. For example, if the rating action was a downgrade, the NRSRO would need to classify it
as a “downgrade” and not, for example, a change of the current credit rating from the AA notch to the AAnotch or from the C notch to default. This would allow users of the disclosures to sort the information by,
for example, initial credit ratings, upgrades, and downgrades.

827

See paragraph (b)(2)(v)(A) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33542. As discussed above, under the proposal, all credit ratings outstanding as of
June 26, 2007 and associated information as of that date would need to be disclosed to establish the first
data point in the rating history of a credit rating that was outstanding as of that date. This would have
meant that thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of rating histories each beginning on June 26, 2007
would be disclosed. The proposed classification was designed to alert users of the disclosures that the
proposed rule caused the June 26, 2007 entry in the rating history of the obligor, security, or money market
instrument and not because, for example, a credit rating was initially determined for the obligor, security,
or money market instrument on that date.

828

See paragraph (b)(2)(v)(B) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33542. An NRSRO would select this classification if the rating action was the first
credit rating determined by the NRSRO with respect to the obligor, security, or money market instrument.

•

A withdrawal of an existing credit rating and, if the classification is withdrawal, the
reason for the withdrawal as: (1) the obligor defaulted, or the security or money market
instrument went into default; (2) the obligation subject to the credit rating was
extinguished by payment in full of all outstanding principal and interest due on the
obligation according to the terms of the obligation; or (3) the credit rating was withdrawn
for reasons other than those set forth in items (1) or (2) above. 833
The Commission is adopting paragraph (b)(2)(v) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications. First,

the final amendments eliminate the rating action classifications with respect to placing a credit
rating on watch or review and with respect to affirming a credit rating. 834 As discussed above,
the amendments do not require the rating histories disclosure to include these types of rating
actions.
Second, paragraph (b)(2)(v)(A) of Rule 17g-7 has been modified. 835 As discussed above,
this provision was designed to alert a user of the rating histories disclosure that the credit rating
and related information about the credit rating was added to the history because of the
requirement in the proposal to add all credit ratings outstanding as of June 26, 2007. The final
amendments – as discussed above – modify this requirement from the proposal so that an
NRSRO must include with each credit rating disclosed under paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17g-7 a
classification of the rating action, if applicable, as an addition to the rating history disclosure: (1)
because the credit rating was outstanding as of the date three years prior to the effective date of
the requirements in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7; or (2) because the credit rating was outstanding
as of the date three years prior to the date the NRSRO became registered in the class of credit

Organizations, 76 FR at 33542.

834

See paragraph (b)(2)(v) of Rule 17g-7. As a result of these modifications, paragraph (b)(2)(v)(G) of Rule
17g-7, as proposed, is re-designated paragraph (b)(2)(v)(E) of Rule 17g-7.

835

See paragraph (b)(2)(v)(A) of Rule 17g-7.

224

ratings. 836 Consequently, paragraph (b)(2)(v)(A) of Rule 17a-7, as adopted, is modified to
conform to this change. 837
Paragraph (b)(2)(v)(E) of Rule 17g-7, as adopted, requires the NRSRO, in the case of a
withdrawal, to classify the reason for the withdrawal as either: (1) the obligor defaulted, or the
security or money market instrument went into default; (2) the obligation subject to the credit
rating was extinguished by payment in full of all outstanding principal and interest due on the
obligation according to the terms of the obligation; or (3) the credit rating was withdrawn for
reasons other than those set forth in (1) and (2) above. 838 These sub-classifications parallel, in
many respects, the outcomes identified in paragraphs (4)(B)(iii), (iv), and (v) of the instructions
for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO discussed above in section II.E.1.b. of this release. However,
unlike the instructions for Exhibit 1, the final amendments do not prescribe standard definitions
of default and paid-off for the purposes of making these classifications in the rating histories
disclosure. The rating histories disclosure requirement is designed to allow investors and other
users of credit ratings to compare how each NRSRO treats a commonly rated obligor, security,
or money market instrument. In other words, unlike the production of performance statistics
where standard definitions are necessary to promote comparability of aggregate statistics, the
historical rating information should indicate on a granular level the differences among the
NRSROs with respect to the rating actions they take for a commonly rated obligor, security, or
money market instrument, including their differing definitions of default. This will allow
investors and other users of credit ratings to review, for example, when one NRSRO downgraded
836

See paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17g-7.

837

See paragraph (b)(2)(v)(A) of Rule 17g-7. The final amendments identify the classification as an addition
to the rating history disclosure because the credit rating was outstanding as of the date three years prior to
the effective date of the requirements in the amendments or because the credit rating was outstanding as of
the date three years prior to the NRSRO becoming registered in the class of credit ratings. Id.

an obligor to the default category as compared to another NRSRO or group of NRSROs. Among
other things, investors and other users of credit ratings could review the data to identify NRSROs
that are either quick or slow to downgrade obligors, securities, or money market instruments to
default. In addition, an NRSRO with a very narrow definition of default might continue to
maintain a security at a notch in its rating scale above the default category when other NRSROs,
using broader definitions, had classified the security as having gone into default. Creating a
mechanism to identify these types of variances is a goal of the enhancements to the 100% Rule.
The Commission believes a default and the extinguishment of an obligation because it
was paid in full are the most frequently occurring reasons for an NRSRO to withdraw a credit
rating. As discussed above in section II.E.1. of this release, there are other reasons an NRSRO
might withdraw a credit rating, including that the rated obligor or issuer of the rated security or
money market instrument stopped paying for the surveillance of the credit rating or the NRSRO
decided not to devote resources to continue to perform surveillance on the credit rating on an
unsolicited basis. However, the withdrawal of credit ratings could be used to make performance
statistics appear more favorable. Consequently, as with the Transition/Default Matrices in
Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, an NRSRO would be required to identify when a credit rating was
withdrawn for reasons other than default or the extinguishment of the obligation upon which the
credit rating is based. Similar to the Transition/Default Matrices, persons using the rating history
information could analyze how often an NRSRO withdraws a credit rating for other reasons in a
class or subclass of credit ratings.
One NRSRO stated that it does not subdivide withdrawn ratings into the subcategories of:
(1) withdrawn due to default: (2) withdrawn because the obligation paid in full; and (3)

226

withdrawn for “other” reasons. 839 This NRSRO also stated that since it does not monitor
withdrawn ratings, it could not certify with confidence that its performance statistics include all
defaults with respect to withdrawn ratings, and requiring such monitoring might constitute
regulation of the substance of an NRSRO’s rating procedures. However, section 15E(q)(2)(C) of
the Exchange Act requires that the Commission’s rules require the disclosure of performance
information for a variety of credit ratings, including for credit ratings withdrawn by an
NRSRO. 840 As discussed above, the reason an NRSRO withdraws a credit rating is important
information in terms of assessing the performance of an NRSRO’s credit ratings. For these
reasons, the final amendments retain the requirement to classify the reason for the withdrawal.
In response to comment, 841 as stated above with respect to the amendments to the instructions for
Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, the Commission is clarifying that the amendments as adopted do not
require NRSROs to monitor withdrawn credit ratings for a period of time after withdrawal. A
withdrawn credit rating is categorized at the time of withdrawal. There is no requirement to
update the rating history thereafter.
Paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would identify the sixth category of data
that must be disclosed with a rating action: a classification of the class or subclass of the credit
rating. 842 The Commission is adopting this paragraph as proposed. 843 The classifications for the
classes of credit ratings are based on the definition of nationally recognized statistical rating

organization in section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act. 844 Consequently, the first classification is
financial institutions, brokers, or dealers. 845 The second classification is insurance companies. 846
The third classification is corporate issuers. 847
The fourth classification is issuers of structured finance products. 848 If the credit rating
falls into this class, the NRSRO must disclose which of the following sub-classifications it falls
into: RMBS; 849 CMBS; 850 CLOs; 851 CDOs; 852 ABCP; 853 other asset-backed securities; 854 or
other structured finance products. 855 The sub-classifications are the same subclasses for

844

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(a)(62). This is consistent with how the classes of credit ratings are identified for the
purposes of the performance statistics that must be disclosed in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. Compare
paragraphs (b)(2)(vi)(A) through (E) of Rule 17g-7, with paragraphs (1)(A) through (E) of the instructions
for Form NRSRO.

15E(a)(62)(B)(iv) of the Exchange Act.

849

for the purposes of the rule means a securitization primarily of commercial loans.

852

CMBS, CLOs, CDOs, other asset backed securities, and corporate bonds.

853

See paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(D)(5) of Rule 17g-7. Consistent with Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, the term ABCP
for the purposes of the rule means short term notes issued by a structure that securitizes a variety of
financial assets (for example, trade receivables or credit card receivables), which secure the notes.

854

See proposed paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(D)(6) of Rule 17g-7. Consistent with Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, the
term other asset backed security for the purposes of the rule means a securitization primarily of auto loans,
auto leases, floor plan financings, credit card receivables, student loans, consumer loans, equipment loans,
or equipment leases.

855

See proposed paragraph (b)(2)(vi)(D)(7) of Rule 17g-7. Consistent with Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, the
term other structured finance product for the purposes of the rule means a structured finance product not
identified in the other sub-classifications of structured finance products.

228

structured finance credit ratings an applicant and NRSRO must use for the purposes of the
Transition/Default Matrices to be disclosed in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. 856
The fifth classification is issuers of government securities, municipal securities, or
securities issued by a foreign government. 857 If the credit rating falls into this class, the final
amendments require the NRSRO to identify a sub-classification as well. 858 The subclassifications are the same as the sub-classifications for this class in the instructions for Exhibit
1 to Form NRSRO: (1) sovereign issuers; (2) U.S. public finance; or (3) international public
finance. 859
Paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would identify the seventh category of
data that must be disclosed with a rating action: the credit rating symbol, number, or score in the
applicable rating scale of the NRSRO assigned to the obligor, security, or money market
instrument as a result of the rating action or, if the credit rating remained unchanged as a result
of the action, the credit rating symbol, number, or score in the applicable rating scale of the
NRSRO assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument as of the date of the rating
action. 860 The NRSRO also would have to indicate whether the credit rating is in a default
category. The Commission is adopting this paragraph as proposed. 861 The rating symbol,
number, or score is a key component of the data that must be disclosed as it reflects the

NRSRO’s view of the relative creditworthiness of the obligor, security, or money market
instrument subject to the rating as of the date the action is taken.
Paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would provide that the information
identified in paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-7 must be disclosed in an interactive data file that uses
an XBRL format and the List of XBRL Tags for NRSROs as published on the Internet website
of the Commission.862 One commenter stated that constantly updating the database for the 100%
Rule “would impose an unwarranted burden on NRSROs” and requested that the Commission
confirm that it may update the database monthly. 863 The Commission agrees that the rule should
prescribe a standard timeframe within which the XBRL data file must be updated and that the
standard should take into account the burden of updating the file. Consequently, the final
amendments provide that the XBRL data file must be updated no less frequently than monthly
consistent with the commenter’s proposal. 864
Paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would specify when a rating action would
need to be disclosed by establishing two distinct grace periods: twelve months and twenty-four
months. 865 In particular, a rating action would need to be disclosed: (1) within twelve months
from the date the action is taken, if the credit rating subject to the action was paid for by the
obligor being rated or by the issuer, underwriter, depositor, or sponsor of the security being
rated; 866 or (2) within twenty-four months from the date the action is taken, if the credit rating

subject to the action is not a rating described above. 867 These separate grace periods are
consistent with the requirements of the 100% Rule before today’s amendments. 868 Commenters
expressed opposing views on the appropriate length of the grace periods and whether there
should be one grace period for all NRSROs. 869 One NRSRO stated that the grace periods are
“appropriate.” 870 Another NRSRO stated that the Commission should consider a three-year
grace period for rating histories of subscriber-paid credit ratings. 871 Two NRSROs were opposed
to having two grace periods, 872 and one of these NRSROs stated that there should be an eighteen
month grace period for all NRSROs “if the goal is to foster comparability among NRSROs.” 873
Another commenter was “disappointed” that the Commission was retaining the twelve and
twenty-four month grace periods, because “such delay is excessive and severely diminishes the
usefulness of the information.” 874
The Commission believes that the twelve and twenty-four month grace periods strike an
appropriate balance between the interests of users of credit ratings and the interests of NRSROs
with various business models. 875 In particular, the longer grace period for NRSROs operating
under the subscriber-paid business model is premised on the fact that the revenues earned by
these NRSROs for their credit rating activities are derived largely from subscriptions to access

their credit ratings and related analyses. NRSROs operating under the issuer-pay business model
earn revenues largely from the fees paid by obligors and issuers to determine credit ratings for
the obligor as an entity or for the issuer’s securities or money market instruments. These issuerpaid credit ratings typically are publicly disclosed. For these reasons, subscriber-paid NRSROs
would be disproportionately impacted if the rating histories disclosure requirement resulted in
subscribers canceling subscriptions. Consequently, the Commission continues to believe the
longer twenty-four month grace period is appropriate to limit the disproportionate impact on
subscriber-paid NRSROs.
Finally, paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would provide that an NRSRO may
cease disclosing a rating history of an obligor, security, or money market instrument no earlier
than twenty years after the date a rating action with respect to the obligor, security, or money
market instrument is classified as a withdrawal of the credit rating, provided no subsequent credit
ratings are assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument after the withdrawal
classification. 876 This proposed requirement was designed to ensure that information about
credit ratings that are withdrawn for any reason would remain a part of the disclosure for a
significant period of time. Two NRSROs commented on this aspect of the proposal. 877 One
NRSRO stated that ten years is sufficient, consistent with the Transition/Default Matrices in
Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, and that the Commission should perform a cost/benefit analysis of
the requirement periodically to confirm that the benefits outweigh the costs. 878 The other
NRSRO stated that the information would become less useful to investors as the volume of

information on withdrawn ratings increases. 879 The Commission agrees at this time that a
shorter retention period is appropriate considering the costs and benefits of retaining rating
histories with respect to withdrawn ratings. Consequently, the final amendments provide that the
NRSRO may cease disclosing a rating history of an obligor, security, or money market
instrument if at least fifteen years has elapsed since a rating action classified as a withdrawal of a
credit rating pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v)(E) of Rule 17g-7 was disclosed in the rating history
of the obligor, security, or money market instrument. 880

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the specific amendments
relating to the disclosure of information about the performance of credit ratings. 881 The baseline
that existed before today’s amendments was one in which NRSROs were required to make
publicly available two types of information about the performance of their credit ratings: (1)
transition and default statistics; and (2) rating histories for certain subsets of the obligors,
securities, and money-market instruments that they have rated. 882
Before today’s amendments, the instructions for Exhibit 1 required the applicant or
NRSRO to provide performance statistics for the credit ratings of the applicant or NRSRO,
including performance statistics for each class of credit ratings for which the applicant is seeking
registration or the NRSRO is registered. In addition, the instructions required that the
performance statistics must, at a minimum, show the performance of credit ratings in each class
879

See paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 17g-7.

881

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may
derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today.

over one-year, three-year, and ten-year periods (as applicable) through the most recent calendar
year-end, including transition and default rates within each of the credit rating categories,
notches, grades, or rankings used by the applicant or NRSRO. Before today’s amendments, the
instructions for Exhibit 1 did not prescribe the methodology to be used to calculate the
performance statistics or the format in which they must be disclosed; nor did the instructions
limit the type of information that can be disclosed in the Exhibit. The instructions did, however,
require an applicant or NRSRO to define the credit rating categories, notches, grades, or rankings
it used and to explain the performance measurement statistics, including the inputs, time
horizons, and metrics used to determine the statistics. Disclosures provided in Exhibit 2, which
require a “general description of the procedures and methodologies used” by the NRSRO in
determining credit ratings, may have provided additional context for comparing the performance
statistics of different NRSROs. NRSROs made their most recent Forms NRSRO and Exhibits 1
through 9 to the forms available on their corporate Internet websites, though they were also
permitted to make the disclosures publicly available through another comparable, readily
accessible means. They were not required to provide Exhibit 1 in writing when requested.
NRSROs also voluntarily provided additional performance statistics in Exhibit 1 or
elsewhere on their public Internet websites, such as transition and default statistics for particular
asset sub-classes, geographies, or industries, or alternative analyses such as Lorenz curves. The
voluntary disclosures of such statistics have varied, and some NRSROs, particularly larger ones,
may have been able to provide more supplementary statistics at a granular level because they had
more credit ratings, over a longer historical period, to analyze. 883

883

See GAO Report 10-782, p. 25.

234

In characterizing the baseline, it is useful to consider the performance statistics disclosed
in NRSROs’ annual certifications for the 2009 calendar year, as reviewed by the GAO in its
2010 report. While the disclosures from that year may not be representative of current NRSRO
practices, they provide insight into NRSRO practices in 2009 under the rules governing the
disclosure of performance statistics before today’s amendments. Reviewing the 2009 disclosures
of the ten NRSROs then registered, the GAO found significant differences across NRSROs in
the computation of performance statistics, which limited their comparability. 884 These
differences included, among other things: (1) whether a single cohort approach or an average
cohort approach was used; (2) whether or not statistics were adjusted to exclude withdrawn
credit ratings; (3) whether default rates were indicated relative to initial credit ratings or credit
ratings as of the beginning of a given period, and (4) whether default statistics were adjusted
based on the time to default. 885 The GAO found that five NRSROs did not provide the number
of credit ratings in each rating category, which made it impossible either to re-calculate more
comparable statistics or to judge the reliability of the performance statistics. 886 The GAO also
found that the asset-backed security class of credit ratings may have been too broad for
performance statistics for this class as a whole to be meaningful. 887 The GAO concluded that

(3) were adjusted for entities that have had their ratings withdrawn or unadjusted, and (4) allowed entities
to transition to default or not.”); Id. at 30-31 (“NRSROs also used different methodologies for calculating
default rates. In general, default rates differed by whether they were (1) relative to ratings at the beginning
of a given time period or relative to initial ratings, (2) adjusted for entities that had their ratings withdrawn
or unadjusted, (3) adjusted for how long entities survived without defaulting or unadjusted, (4) calculated
using annual or monthly cohorts, and (5) calculated for a single cohort or averaged over many cohorts.”).

235

“the disclosure of these statistics has not had the intended effect of increasing transparency for
users.” 888
Before today’s amendments, the requirements for NRSROs to make certain rating
histories publicly available (the 10% Rule and the 100% Rule) were contained in paragraphs
(d)(2) and (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2, respectively. The 10% Rule applied only to NRSROs operating
under the issuer-pays model, and required the disclosure of rating actions for a random 10%
sample of outstanding credit ratings in each class in which an NRSRO was registered and for
which the NRSRO had more than 500 issuer-paid credit ratings outstanding. The 100% Rule
applied to all NRSROs, and required the disclosure of rating actions for any credit ratings
initially determined by the NRSRO on or after June 26, 2007. Under both rules, the rating action
information required to be disclosed was consistent with the information required to be retained
pursuant to paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17g-2. The rating actions that were required to be included
in the histories were initial ratings, upgrades, downgrades, placements on credit watch, and
withdrawals, and the information required to be disclosed for each such rating action was the
rating action, date of the action, the name of the security or obligor, and, if applicable, the CUSIP
of the security or CIK number of the obligor. The 10% Rule included a six-month grace period
after ratings actions were taken before disclosure was required, while the 100% Rule included a
twelve-month grace period for issuer-paid credit ratings and a twenty-four-month grace period
for all other credit ratings. NRSROs made the required rating histories publicly available on
their corporate Internet websites.
In characterizing the baseline, it is useful to consider, as in the case of performance
statistics, the conclusions of the GAO in its 2010 report with respect to the disclosure of rating

888

236

histories by NRSROs. While the disclosures from that period may not be representative of
current NRSRO practices, the GAO study provides insight into NRSRO practices at the time of
the report and into the limitations of the 10% Rule and 100% Rule before today’s amendments.
The GAO stated its view that the rating histories provided at that time could not be used to
generate reliable performance statistics because, among other things: (1) the 10% samples were
being generated in ways that did not make them representative of the total population of credit
ratings produced by the NRSROs; (2) the 100% samples were also unrepresentative, because, for
example, they were missing the issuer credit ratings of many major American corporations
because these credit ratings were initiated before 2007; (3) the data fields provided were
insufficient; and (4) not all NRSROs disclosed defaults in these histories. 889 The GAO also
stated, in explaining why the 10% and 100% samples were unrepresentative of the universe of
credit ratings, that these samples were not required to include credit ratings that had been
withdrawn in prior periods, leading to a sample in which cases of defaults would be
underrepresented. 890 The GAO concluded that it was unlikely that the required rating histories
could be used to generate performance measures and studies to evaluate and compare NRSRO
performance. 891

889

See GAO Report 10-782, p. 40-46 (stating, for example, with respect to the 10% samples, that the GAO
“could not use these samples to generate reliable performance statistics for the NRSROs, as the rule
intended, for the following reasons: (1) the data fields the NRSROs included in their disclosures were not
always sufficient to identify complete ratings histories for the rated entities comprising each sample, (2) the
data fields did not always give us enough information to identify specific types of ratings for making
comparisons, (3) the data fields did not always give us enough information to identify the beginning of the
ratings histories in all of the samples, (4) SEC rules do not require the NRSROs to publish a codebook or
any explanation of the variables used in the samples, (5) not all NRSROs are disclosing defaults in the
ratings histories provided as part of their 10 percent samples, and (6) SEC guidance to the NRSROs for
generating the random samples does not ensure that the methods used will create a sample that is
representative of the population of credit ratings produced by each NRSRO.”).

237

Relative to the baseline, the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form
NRSRO, Rule 17g-1, Rule 17g-2, and Rule 17g-7 with respect to the disclosure of performance
statistics and rating histories should result in benefits for users of credit ratings. The
amendments, which implement the provisions of section 15E(q) of the Exchange Act and, as
discussed in sections II.E.1. and II.E.3. of this release, took into account findings by the GAO,
should result in performance statistics that are more directly comparable across NRSROs and
ratings histories that are more useful for performance analyses than those provided under the
baseline requirements. 892 To the extent that the new disclosures therefore facilitate the
evaluation of the performance of an NRSRO’s credit ratings and comparisons of rating
performance across NRSROs – including direct comparisons of different NRSROs’ treatment of
the same obligor or instrument – the amendments may benefit users of credit ratings by allowing
them to better assess the reliability and information content of credit ratings from different
NRSROs and, in the case of subscriber-paid credit ratings, make more informed decisions
regarding whether to subscribe to the credit ratings of particular NRSROs.
Specifically, the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 requiring a standardized
calculation of performance statistics – using specified definitions and the single cohort approach
– to be presented in a standardized format and specifying that an applicant or NRSRO must not
disclose information in the Exhibit that is not required to be disclosed are expected to result in

892

While the amendments are designed to facilitate comparisons across NRSROs, differences in the meanings
of the credit ratings of different NRSROs and in the procedures and methodologies they use to determine
credit ratings will likely influence the ability to make perfect comparisons. For example, there is variability
across NRSROs with respect to the information that is reflected in a credit rating. See, e.g., S&P Letter;
GAO Report 10-782, p. 37-39. Some credit ratings, for example, reflect relative assessments of the
likelihood an obligor or issuer will default on the “first dollar” owed, whereas other credit ratings also
reflect the expected loss in the case of default. In interpreting the performance statistics and rating
histories, users of credit ratings may thus need to account for additional contextual information, such as the
general description of the procedures and methodologies used by the NRSRO to determine credit ratings
required to be disclosed in Exhibit 2, in order to understand the limits to the comparability of the
disclosures.

238

simpler, more standardized disclosures relative to the disclosures produced under the baseline
requirements. Moreover, the single cohort approach involves simpler computations than other
approaches, so it may be easier for users of credit ratings to understand how the statistics were
produced. Also, requiring all NRSROs to use the single cohort approach ensures that the cohorts
being analyzed will be aligned across NRSROs, increasing the comparability of the statistics
versus other computation methods (such as the average cohort approach). The amendments
therefore may allow users of credit ratings, including users with a wide range of sophistication,
to more readily compare the performance of credit ratings of different NRSROs than they could
previously. The new requirement to divide the class of issuers of asset-backed securities into
subclasses and the requirement to separately disclose the number of credit ratings that are
withdrawn because the obligation has been paid in full, because the obligor defaulted, and for
other reasons, as well as to report the total number of credit ratings in the start-date cohort in
each category, should provide users of credit ratings with additional information that may help
them better interpret the transition and default rates for the purpose of evaluating and comparing
performance. 893
In addition, the new requirements that expand the scope of credit ratings that must be
included in the rating histories should, over time, generate databases that will include a
comprehensive sample of rating actions (in contrast to the data disclosed under the baseline
requirements). The databases also will include information about cohorts of credit ratings

893

While the standard definition of default is intended to facilitate comparisons across NRSROs, there may
continue to be differences across NRSROs in the identification of defaults in the performance statistics
which may reduce somewhat the comparability of these statistics. When an event occurs that does not meet
the standardized definition of default in Exhibit 1, it may still be categorized as a default by an NRSRO
under its own definition of default, which is incorporated into the Exhibit 1 definition. In interpreting the
performance statistics, users of credit ratings may thus need to account for additional contextual
information such as the new requirement to “clearly explain” the usage of the term default directly after the
performance statistics.

239

beyond those reflected in the performance statistics disclosed in Exhibit 1. Thus, the enhanced
rating histories can be used to generate alternative statistics for evaluating and comparing
NRSRO performance, including certain transition and default statistics using average cohort
approaches (though, as discussed below, these statistics will likely be based on fewer cohorts
than were used by NRSROs that disclosed performance statistics in Exhibit 1 using the average
cohort approach before today’s amendments). Because the data will be more comprehensive
than that disclosed in the baseline, it should also be more likely, relative to the baseline, that
rating histories of different NRSROs with respect to the same obligor or instrument will be
available. Therefore, users of credit ratings should have more opportunities to directly compare
and analyze different NRSROs’ treatment of the same obligor or instrument over time. The
requirements regarding the enhanced data fields to be included with a rating action should make
any analyses using the rating histories more practicable than was the case with the more limited
data fields produced under the baseline requirements. 894
However, the benefits of the amendments in facilitating the evaluation and comparisons
of NRSROs may be constrained by limits on the information required by the final rules, which,
as discussed in this section, are intended to reduce the burdens on NRSROs resulting from the
amendments and, with respect to the performance statistics, make them easier for users of credit
ratings to understand how the statistics were produced. For example, while mandating that only
single cohort statistics be presented fosters comparability, the resulting disclosures will present
the performance of only three particular cohorts of credit ratings (beginning one, three, and ten
894

There may be differences across NRSROs in the identification of defaults and paid off obligations in the
rating histories which reduce somewhat the comparability of this data across NRSROs, since the
amendments do not prescribe definitions of these terms for the purpose of the rating histories. In
interpreting the rating histories, users of credit ratings may thus need to account for additional contextual
information such as the new requirement to “clearly explain” the conditions under which an NRSRO
classifies obligors, securities, or money market instruments as being in default after the performance
statistics presented in Exhibit 1.

240

years prior to the end of the fiscal year). These statistics therefore may be subject to substantial
volatility, particularly for NRSROs with fewer credit ratings. 895 The fact that the credit ratings
of particular NRSROs may be more heavily weighted towards particular industries, geographies,
or other sectors that might experience more defaults or other changes in creditworthiness over a
particular measurement period also may exacerbate volatility in their performance statistics and
make it difficult to separate differences in NRSRO performance from the effects of recent
conditions. 896 NRSROs are only required to provide their current Form NRSRO on their
websites, so users of credit ratings may not have access to previous Forms NRSRO in order to
consider the cohorts analyzed in these other years. 897
The rating histories may be helpful to users of credit ratings in addressing the limitations
of the performance statistics both in that information about many additional cohorts may be
available and also through the ability to directly compare NRSRO performance with respect to
the same obligor or instrument. Such direct comparisons should not be skewed by the industry
or sector focus of a given NRSRO. However, the final rules require only one or two years of

895

Averages over a smaller sample size are more susceptible to being skewed by individual extreme data
points. See also DBRS Letter (stating that “results will be significantly more volatile within the shorter
time period, which will make interpreting those results more difficult” and that “the volatility impact will
be amplified for NRSROs with fewer ratings”).

896

A particular industry, geography, or other sector of the market may experience a period of poor
performance common to all issuers and securities in that group, resulting in high default rates in that period.
Economy-wide default rates are likely to be less volatile than the default rates for these individual groups
since they reflect an average across many such groups, which may face downturns at different times. Thus,
when considering performance over a short period, as in the case of the single cohort approach, the
performance of NRSROs that focus on fewer industries, geographies, or other sectors may be skewed by
any recent extremes in performance experienced by these sectors, leading to more volatile performance
statistics. When such NRSROs are compared to other NRSROs, it may be difficult to interpret whether
differences in their single cohort performance statistics may be due to the recent performance of the sectors
they focus on or whether they reflect differences in the ability of the NRSROs to produce accurate ratings.

897

In the future, users of credit ratings will have access to certain previous Forms NRSRO, including Exhibits
1 through 9 to these Forms. As discussed below in section II.L. of this release, the amendments to Rule
101 of Regulation S-T will require an NRSRO to submit Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 to the
Form electronically through the EDGAR system. Submission through the EDGAR system will maintain
the public availability of a Form NRSRO even after updated versions are submitted.

241

history to be disclosed initially, depending on the applicable grace periods, so the benefits of
these histories will be delayed until the histories grow to a length suitable for analysis. Also, as
discussed below, even as data for additional years becomes available, the ability of NRSROs to
remove a rating history from the data file fifteen years after the credit rating is withdrawn will
limit the amount of historical information in the data file and, therefore, limit analyses by users
of credit ratings that require a representative sample of credit ratings over an extended period of
time. On the other hand, users of credit ratings that are interested in comparing NRSRO
performance over time with respect to the same obligor or instrument should not face the same
limitation and, therefore, should be able to take advantage of the full length of histories provided
under the amendments.
A potential consequence of selecting one approach to be used for purposes of the Exhibit
1 disclosures is that it may impact the disclosures NRSROs make using other approaches. For
example, even though the amendments require NRSROs to use the single cohort approach,
NRSROs may continue on a voluntary basis to provide, not directly in Exhibit 1 but by reference
to an Internet website address in this exhibit, disclosures of additional performance statistics such
as statistics using the average cohort approach. These supplementary statistics may address
some of the aforementioned limitations of statistics using the single cohort approach in that they
may provide users of credit ratings with information about many more cohorts of credit ratings.
However, NRSROs that previously disclosed average cohort statistics to fulfill their Exhibit 1
requirements might not continue to report these statistics voluntarily or might report them in an
even less standardized fashion than previously (for example, for performance periods different
from the one-year, three-year, and ten-year periods required in Exhibit 1). Importantly, NRSROs

242

might be less likely to voluntarily disclose such additional statistics when they do not compare
favorably to the performance of competitors.
The amendments may result in other benefits to users of credit ratings and NRSROs by
enhancing accountability, competition, and efficiency. As has been widely documented, the
most common NRSRO business model – the issuer-pay revenue model – creates an inherent
conflict of interest. 898 Given this conflict, and because the demand for an NRSRO’s credit
ratings depends on its reputation for producing credit ratings of high quality, reputation is
thought to play a particularly important disciplinary role in this industry. 899 To the extent that
the amendments facilitate the external monitoring and comparative analysis of NRSROs, they
may allow users of credit ratings to develop more refined views of NRSRO performance and
thereby indirectly increase accountability and encourage integrity in the production of credit
ratings, since NRSROs should have the incentive to maintain reputations for producing credit
ratings of high quality in order to remain competitive. More comparable performance data also
may help smaller NRSROs and new and recent entrants into the industry, including subscriberpaid NRSROs, to attract attention to their track records of issuing and monitoring credit ratings.
If they produce track records comparable or superior to those of other NRSROs, this could
enhance their ability to develop a reputation for producing high quality credit ratings. Such a
reputation may allow them to better compete with more established competitors. The enhanced
ability of users of credit ratings to evaluate the performance of NRSROs also may increase their

ability to accurately interpret the information conveyed by credit ratings, potentially resulting in
more efficient investment decisions. Market efficiency could also improve if this information is
reflected in asset prices. 900
The amendments to Rule 17g-1 and Rule 17g-7 requiring that these disclosures be
published on an “easily accessible” portion of the NRSRO’s Internet website could result in
incremental benefits relative to the baseline. As mentioned above, the Commission agrees with
commenters that the disclosures would be on an “easily accessible” portion of an NRSRO’s
Internet website if they could be accessed through a clearly and prominently labeled hyperlink
labeled “Regulatory Disclosures” on the homepage of the website. Some NRSROs may already
provide Form NRSRO, Exhibits 1 through 9 to the form, and rating histories in such a location.
However, to the extent that these amendments result in NRSROs moving the disclosures to a
more prominent location on their Internet websites to fulfill the requirement that they be “easily
accessible,” they may incrementally assist users of credit ratings in locating these disclosures.
Requiring that Exhibit 1 be made available in writing when requested may benefit any users of
credit ratings who do not have access to the Internet.
Relative to the baseline, the amendments with respect to the disclosure of performance
statistics and rating histories will impose costs on applicants and NRSROs. In particular, while
all NRSROs currently disclose transition and default rates, the content and presentation of these
performance statistics differ, to varying degrees, from the information required and the format
prescribed by the rules. The revised requirements therefore will require the initial collection and
analysis of certain additional historical data (for example, whether issuers or instruments
defaulted under the standard definition) as well as changes in systems and procedures to collect
900

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

244

and present this information according to the amendments going forward. The Commission’s
estimates of these costs – which are based on analyses for purposes of the PRA – are provided
below.
Two NRSROs have commented that, in some cases, collecting certain historical
information would require substantial cost or could be impossible. 901 The historical information
required for the transition and default statistics which NRSROs may not have stored (or stored in
a readily retrievable format) consists of, over a ten year history, the more detailed categorization
of any withdrawn credit ratings and the assignment of credit ratings in the asset-backed securities
class into sub-classes. As discussed above, the Commission has modified the amendments to
reduce the amount of historical information that may need to be retrieved with respect to
withdrawn credit ratings. In particular, the amendments provide that, except in the case of the
asset-backed securities class of credit ratings, the transition and default statistics must include
only credit ratings assigned to an obligor as an entity or, if there is no such credit rating, the
credit rating of the obligor’s senior unsecured debt, instead of all credit ratings of securities or
money-market instruments in the respective class or subclass. The Commission has also revised
the standard definition of paid off to eliminate the prong that applied to credit ratings of obligors
as entities. Because the Commission has narrowed the scope of the credit ratings that must be
included in the performance statistics for four of the five classes of credit ratings, and has revised
the standard definition of paid off so that it does not apply to entity credit ratings, the cost of
categorizing historical withdrawals based on the standard definitions of default and paid off and
withdrawals for other reasons should be substantially reduced. The modifications from the
proposal should therefore mitigate concerns to some degree about having to obtain information
901

See, e.g., Moody’s Letter (stating that collecting certain data for past rating actions would have to be done
manually); S&P Letter (stating that “it may not be possible to track” the distinction between ratings
withdrawn for different reasons “retroactively”).

245

that was not traditionally retained by the NRSRO because it will significantly narrow the scope
of such information that will need to be collected in order to calculate the performance statistics.
While the Commission believes that these modifications may substantially reduce the amount of
historical data to be collected, an NRSRO can seek exemptive relief from the Commission under
section 36 of the Exchange Act.
The costs of the compliance efforts described above should vary across NRSROs due to:
(1) differences in the quantity of credit ratings they issue and the number of classes of credit
ratings for which they issue credit ratings; (2) differences in terms of how their disclosures under
the baseline requirements compare to the disclosures required under the amendments; (3)
differences with respect to the historical information they currently store in a readily-retrievable
format; (4) differences in the number of past years and number of historical credit ratings for
which additional historical information will need to be collected; and (5) differences in the
design and flexibility of their information systems. However, based on analysis for purposes of
the PRA, the Commission estimates that the amendments to Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO will
result in total industry-wide one-time costs to NRSROs of approximately $737,000 and total
industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of approximately $295,000. 902
Under the amendments to paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1, NRSROs are required to make
Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 freely available on an easily accessible portion of their
corporate Internet website and to provide a paper copy of Exhibit 1 to individuals who request a
paper copy. NRSROs may need to re-configure their corporate Internet websites to comply with
the amendments and will need to establish procedures and protocols for processing requests for a
paper copy. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that the

246

amendments to paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs to
NRSROs of approximately $150,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of
approximately $121,000. 903
The amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 also may result in other costs to
NRSROs. For some NRSROs, it is possible that using only the single cohort approach to
produce the performance statistics in Exhibit 1 may lead users of credit ratings to misinterpret
their performance, negatively impacting competition in the industry. Specifically, as discussed
above, the single cohort approach will produce statistics about three particular cohorts of credit
ratings and may thus be subject to volatility. Further, the statistics may be particularly volatile
for certain NRSROs, such as those that have a small number of credit ratings in a given start date
cohort or those that focus on particular industries, geographies, or other sectors within a class of
credit ratings. The requirements of the final amendments (that is, showing the number of credit
ratings in the start date cohort) are designed to provide persons reviewing the statistics with
sufficient information to readily assess the impact that a small number of credit ratings can have
on the statistics. Also, the disclosure of ratings histories should permit more refined comparisons
of performance in cases where differences in performance statistics may reflect differences in the
universe of obligors or instruments rated by NRSROs. However, some persons reviewing the
transition and default rates could inappropriately view the volatility resulting from such factors
unfavorably, potentially disadvantaging these NRSROs relative to the baseline to the extent that
their reputation for producing quality credit ratings is negatively affected. The competitive
position of small NRSROs may be further disadvantaged by the burden associated with
establishing systems to produce the statistics, since this cost may not depend on the number of
903

one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs
identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.1. of this release.

247

credit ratings in the start-date cohorts and thus may result in a higher relative burden for small
NRSROs. 904
Under the baseline requirements, NRSROs publicly disclosed certain rating histories data
to fulfill the requirements of the 10% Rule and the 100% Rule, but the sample of credit ratings
subject to the disclosure, the rating actions disclosed, the extent of the histories, and the included
data fields differ, to varying degrees, from those required by the amendments. The amendments
may thus require NRSROs to add more rating histories to their disclosures because in contrast to
the baseline requirements the amendments: (1) apply to all credit ratings outstanding as of the
specified date or initiated thereafter rather than a random sample of credit ratings; (2) do not
exclude credit ratings that were outstanding as of the specified date but initiated before June 26,
2007; and (3) require the rating histories of withdrawn ratings to be retained in the file for fifteen
years. Also, the amendments will require NRSROs to revise which rating actions are included
and to provide more information about each rating action in the rating histories. NRSROs
initially will have to collect additional historical data and edit the history files to meet these
requirements. Some of the required information which might not have been collected previously
– such as the categorization of credit ratings in the asset-backed securities class into sub-classes
– will be retrieved in the process of complying with the amended instructions for Exhibit 1 to
Form NRSRO discussed above. NRSROs also will have to reprogram existing systems and
make changes in procedures to collect and upload the information according to the amendments
going forward. NRSROs may have to make changes to their corporate Internet websites to
disclose the information on an “easily accessible” portion of their websites, though the
incremental changes required beyond the website changes to disclose Form NRSRO discussed
904

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

248

above may be minimal. On an ongoing basis, the cost of the procedures required to update the
rating histories files at least monthly may exceed the annual burden previously imposed by the
10% Rule (which is being repealed) and the 100% Rule before today’s amendments, given the
comprehensive nature of the data required. The Commission’s estimates of these costs – which
are based on analyses for purposes of the PRA – are provided below.
One commenter stated that the Commission “substantially underestimated the costs” of
the proposed amendments to the 100% Rule in the proposing release. 905 Two other commenters
raised concerns that retrieving the required historical data would require substantial cost or could
be impossible. 906 The Commission acknowledges that the amendments will impose significant
costs on NRSROs, and has modified the proposal in a number of ways to mitigate costs. First,
the final amendments eliminate the requirement to include information for all credit ratings
outstanding on June 26, 2007, and replace it with a standard three-year backward-looking
requirement that applies irrespective of when the NRSRO is registered in a class of credit ratings.
This should significantly reduce the costs of retrieving and analyzing historical information for
the purposes of making the rating histories disclosures. Further, the final amendments eliminate
two types of rating actions that would trigger a requirement to add information to a credit
rating’s history: placements of the credit rating on watch or review and affirmations of the credit
rating. This may further reduce the cost of retrieving the historical information that must be
disclosed in the rating histories, since a record of an affirmation of the credit rating may not
previously have been stored (or stored in a readily retrievable format) by NRSROs.
Consequently, because of these modifications, NRSROs should not need to perform analyses to
905

See DBRS Letter.

906

See, e.g., Moody’s Letter (stating that collecting certain data for past rating actions would have to be done
manually and “would require tens of thousands of hours of analysis”); S&P Letter (stating that “it may not
be possible to track” the distinction between ratings withdrawn for different reasons “retroactively”).

249

identify historical affirmations and reconstruct the information that would need to have been
disclosed under the proposal in connection with each affirmation of the credit rating (for
example, the date of the action). The remaining information that is required to be disclosed, but
may not have been systematically stored by NRSROs previously (such as the required
categorization of the reason for a withdrawal), generally will need to be collected only once for
each rating history rather than for multiple rating actions within a history, as each rating history
should, for example, have only one withdrawal (whereas a history could have multiple
affirmations of the credit rating). The narrowing of the scope of the types of rating actions that
are required to be included in the rating histories also should reduce the burden of updating the
XBRL data file with new information in the future. While the Commission believes the
modifications discussed above may substantially reduce the costs of retrieving historical data, an
NRSRO can seek exemptive relief from the Commission under section 36 of the Exchange Act.
The amendments also specify a standard for updating the file – no less frequently than monthly.
This should mitigate concerns that the file would need to be updated more frequently. Finally,
the final amendments modify the proposal to reduce the time period a credit rating history must
be retained after the credit rating is withdrawn from twenty years to fifteen years. This should
reduce the data retention and maintenance costs associated with the amendments compared to the
proposal.
The costs of the compliance efforts described above with respect to the amended
requirements for disclosing rating histories should vary across NRSROs due to: (1) differences in
the quantity of credit ratings they issue and have issued in the historical years subject to
disclosure; (2) differences in the data fields that they currently include in their rating histories;
(3) differences with respect to the historical information they currently store in a readily-

250

retrievable format; and (4) differences in the design and flexibility of their information systems.
However, based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that the
amendments to Rule 17g-2 and paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 will result in total industry-wide
one-time costs to NRSROs of approximately $393,000, and total industry-wide annual costs to
NRSROs of approximately $131,000. 907
One commenter stated that the proposed amendments “may force NRSROs to incur
increased licensing costs to add new CUSIP data.” 908 The CUSIP Global Services’ license fees
may vary based on the level of usage (that is, the number of CUSIPs databased and the licensees’
business lines and regions of operation where the data will be used) and the form of usage (such
as the internal databasing of CUSIP data or the distribution of CUSIP data). 909 The Commission
believes that most NRSROs already have licensing agreements in place for their current usage of
CUSIP data, but it is possible that these baseline licensing agreements may need to be expanded
given the additional CUSIP data that may have to be stored and disclosed to comply with the
amendments. The comment letter that highlighted these potential costs did not provide an
estimate of these costs and did not provide data or analysis that would allow the Commission to
estimate how NRSROs’ CUSIP licenses would need to be changed to account for the new
requirements. 910 Without information about the scope of the NRSROs’ current licenses and the

251

cost of obtaining updated licenses, it is not feasible for the Commission to develop an estimate of
any such costs. 911
Another potential cost to NRSROs is the potential loss of revenue from the sale of access
to historical ratings data, as more of this data becomes publicly available. The Commission
understands that revenue from this source may be significant for certain NRSROs, though
commenters did not provide data or analysis that would allow the Commission to estimate the
amount of revenue that could be lost. 912 The Commission is unable to estimate the revenue
attributable to the sale of access to historical ratings data from other sources because the
information about NRSRO revenues available to the Commission is not broken down at this
level of granularity and, in practice, access to such historical data may be bundled with access to
analytical tools and other services. This potential loss of revenue may be mitigated by the grace
periods before disclosure, the fact that historical information before the three-year look-back
period is not required to be disclosed, the exclusion of placements on credit watch and
affirmations from the rating actions that must be disclosed in the public rating histories, 913 and
the ability to remove a rating history from the public data file fifteen years after the credit rating
is withdrawn. However, it is difficult to predict how subscribers will react to the change in the
extent of publicly available data.
Because any such losses in revenue likely would disproportionately affect NRSROs that
are more dependent on revenue from selling access to historical ratings data, and particularly
911

CUSIP Global Services does provide some information about potential license fees on its public website,
but explicitly states that the disclosed fee schedule does not apply to “information providers, whose fees for
their own usage and redistribution of CGS data are calculated using a different pricing model.” The
website also states that the “[f]inal determination of fees is at the judgment of CGS and consideration will
be given to aspects of a customer’s profile.” See http://www.cusip.com/cusip/cgs-license-fees.htm.

912

See, e.g., Fitch Letter.

913

For example, as discussed below, academic research suggests that placements on credit watch are
significant information events, so some users of credit ratings may value information about historical
NRSRO usage and timing of placements on credit watch.

252

NRSROs that operate on the subscriber-pay model, the disclosure requirement may disadvantage
these NRSROs to the detriment of competition in the industry. Additional impacts on
competition may result from the disproportionate burden on small NRSROs, given that some of
the compliance costs are not likely to vary with size, and on NRSROs that have systems and data
collection procedures that vary the most from the requirements of the amendments.
In addition to these effects, the amendments may affect capital formation. Some
academic research indicates that credit rating agencies should not focus exclusively on ratings
accuracy, but also should consider the feedback effects of their credit ratings on the probability
of survival of an issuer. 914 Specifically, these theories suggest that if credit ratings can directly
affect the default probability of an issuer, such as when a ratings downgrade itself makes it
harder or more costly for a company to raise funds, then it may be optimal for credit rating
agencies to delay credit rating downgrades in order to lessen the impact of such feedback on the
company’s prospects. If the adopted rules drive increased transparency with respect to
performance, and this leads to pressures on NRSROs to assign more accurate credit ratings by
making earlier downgrades, the amplified feedback effects could increase the default frequencies
of issuers and other obligors. 915
The Commission has considered the costs and benefits of reasonable alternatives relative
to today’s amendments, including certain alternatives that have been raised by commenters and
discussed above. One NRSRO requested that the Commission provide “fuller background” on
decisions such as the determination to require the single cohort approach rather than an average
cohort approach for performance statistics, with a description of potential benefits and
914

See, e.g., Gustavo Manso, Feedback Effects of Credit Ratings, J. OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS (2013),
Volume 109, p. 535–548.

915

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

253

limitations of those decisions. 916 As an alternative to the single cohort approach, the
Commission could have required NRSROs to use the average cohort approach, or to present two
sets of statistics using the average and single cohort approaches respectively, as suggested by
commenters. 917 Statistics generated using the average cohort approach would provide
information to users of credit ratings that is not available from statistics generated using the
single cohort approach, specifically with regard to how credit ratings perform on average across
a wider variety of economic conditions. Such information may be of use to users of credit
ratings in evaluating and comparing the performance of NRSROs. However, variation in the
length of histories available at the different NRSROs makes it difficult to produce a standardized
methodology for computing average cohort statistics that would be comparable across NRSROs.
Also, because the single cohort approach requires simpler calculations, it may be less
burdensome for NRSROs to produce such statistics and easier for less sophisticated investors to
understand how such performance measurement statistics were produced. As discussed above,
NRSROs will continue to be permitted to present alternative statistics on a voluntary basis on
their public websites, and by reference to a URL in Exhibit 1.
A second alternative with respect to the performance statistics would be to require the
disclosure of withdrawn credit ratings, without requiring that this category be separated into
credit ratings that were withdrawn because the related obligation was paid off, because the
obligor defaulted, or for other reasons. This alternative would be less burdensome than the
approach in the amendments, because, as discussed by two commenters, 918 NRSROs that have
916

See Kroll Letter.

917

See CFA/AFR Letter; DBRS Letter.

918

See Moody’s Letter (stating that it does not “systematically capture data that sub-divides withdrawn credit
ratings into the three sub-categories” and that collecting this data for past rating actions “would have to be
done manually”); S&P Letter (“NRSROs may not currently distinguish between ratings on instruments that
are paid off and withdrawn. Tracking this distinction going forward, to the extent it is not presently being

254

not tracked this information historically likely would incur costs to collect the required
information retroactively and change their systems to collect and report this information going
forward. However, given that an applicant or NRSRO could withdraw a credit rating to make its
transition or default rates appear more favorable, information about the reasons for withdrawal is
likely to be useful to users of credit ratings in interpreting the performance statistics.
An alternative approach to the amendments regarding rating histories would be to require
the inclusion of placements on credit watch in the rating histories, while still excluding ratings
affirmations, which would be consistent with the rating actions subject to disclosure in histories
under the baseline requirements. Among the three commenters that recommended that the scope
of rating actions included in public rating histories be narrowed, two did not raise concerns about
the inclusion of placements on credit watch. 919 Academic research has found that credit watch
announcements are associated with abnormal stock and bond returns, indicating that placing a
rating on credit watch is a significant information event. 920 Including these announcements in
rating histories would thus allow persons to, for example, judge which NRSROs have
historically been more likely to provide, and more timely at providing, this information to the
users of credit ratings, and thus may increase the accountability, time sensitivity, and
judiciousness of NRSROs in placing credit ratings on credit watch. However, while making
information about placements on credit watch publicly available in the rating histories may
benefit users of credit ratings that value this information, the fact that some users of credit ratings

done, will require significant systems changes. In addition, it may not be possible to track this distinction
retroactively.”).
919

See ABA Letter; S&P Letter. Another commenter recommended that the Commission exclude both
affirmations and placements on credit watch, as well as assignments of default status, from the definition of
rating action. See Moody’s Letter.

and Stock Prices; Chung, Frost, and Kim, Characteristics and Information Value of Credit Watches.

255

may value this information also means that excluding such information from rating histories may
make subscribers to NRSRO services that include access to historical ratings data (including
placements on credit watch) somewhat less likely to stop subscribing as an increasing amount of
historical ratings data becomes publicly available. The Commission therefore believes that
excluding placements on credit watch from the rating histories may reduce potential losses in
NRSRO revenues from services that include access to their credit ratings and/or rating histories
while still permitting users of credit ratings to use the public rating histories to conduct certain
analyses (such as calculating alternative transition and default statistics) to evaluate and compare
NRSRO performance.
Additional alternatives with respect to rating history disclosure would be to not permit a
rating history for a credit rating to be removed from the data file fifteen years after the credit
rating is withdrawn, or to shorten the retention period to ten years as suggested by a
commenter. 921 Under the first alternative, the retention period could be substantially increased
or a history could be required to be retained permanently. In particular, because the amendments
allow credit ratings to be removed from the histories fifteen years after they are withdrawn, any
data that becomes available for periods over fifteen years in the past will not reflect a
representative sample of the credit ratings of the NRSRO, since withdrawn credit ratings,
including credit ratings withdrawn because of default, will be underrepresented in the sample of
outstanding credit ratings in the rating histories for a period that is more than fifteen years in the
past. 922 Thus, the data files disclosed pursuant to the amendments will over time result in no

921

See DBRS Letter.

922

See GAO Report 10-782, pp. 46, 98. See also id. at 98 (stating that “[t]o the extent that withdrawn ratings
are not included in the data, users will not be able to generate withdrawal-adjusted statistics and the data
will underrepresent defaulted issuers and issues” and recommending that “withdrawn ratings are not
removed from these disclosures”).

256

more than fifteen years (and likely no more than thirteen or fourteen years, given the permitted
grace periods) of data that is fully comprehensive and can therefore be used to calculate
performance statistics or perform other analyses that require a representative sample of credit
ratings. The data will, over time, become sufficient to produce, for example, five-year and
twelve-year performance statistics using the single cohort approach or, for example, three-year
performance statistics using the average cohort approach applied to the eleven annual cohorts
beginning thirteen years ago. However, performance statistics using the data from ratings
histories will be limited to cohorts of credit ratings over these thirteen or fourteen years of
history and thus may not reflect as wide as a variety of economic conditions as may be desired.
Increasing the retention period would therefore benefit users of credit ratings interested in
using the rating histories to perform analyses that require a representative sample of the credit
ratings of the NRSRO outstanding as of a date or a series of dates that are more than thirteen or
fourteen years in the past. However, as in the case of excluding data with respect to placements
on credit watch, applying a shorter retention period may reduce potential losses to NRSROs of
revenue from selling access to historical ratings data. Also, one NRSRO stated that “the amount
of data storage required” to comply with a twenty-year retention requirement for the public
rating histories “would be considerable.” 923 The Commission therefore believes that a fifteenyear retention requirement may reduce the burden on NRSROs, while still permitting users of
credit ratings to use the public rating histories to conduct certain analyses (such as transition and
default statistics that require up to thirteen or fourteen years of data, or comparisons over longer
horizons of NRSRO performance with respect to the same obligor or instrument) to evaluate and
compare NRSRO performance.

923

See S&P Letter.

257

For these reasons, the Commission also does not believe it would be appropriate to
shorten the retention period to ten years as suggested by one commenter. 924 A ten year retention
period (rather than a fifteen year retention period) would further limit the utility of the rating
histories in terms of being able to use the data to generate performance statistics that are different
than the performance statistics that must be disclosed in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO.
A further alternative for rating history disclosure would be to increase or decrease the
grace periods relative to the twelve- and twenty-four-month grace periods that are permitted for
issuer-paid and other credit ratings respectively under the amendments. Longer permitted grace
periods likely would reduce potential losses experienced by NRSROs in revenues from services
that include access to their credit ratings and/or rating histories. However, shorter grace periods
would increase the benefits from the disclosure by making more, and more timely, information
available to users of credit ratings for the purpose of evaluating and comparing the performance
of NRSROs. The Commission believes it has appropriately balanced the costs and benefits of
increasing or decreasing the grace periods in setting the grace periods permitted under the
amendments.

CREDIT RATING METHODOLOGIES

Section 932(a)(8) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 15E of the Exchange Act to
add subsection (r). 925 Section 15E(r) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall
prescribe rules, for the protection of investors and in the public interest, with respect to the
procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and models, used by
NRSROs that require each NRSRO to ensure that objectives identified in section 15E(r) are

258

met. 926 The Commission proposed to implement section 15E(r) in large part, through paragraph
(a) of Rule 17g-8, which would require an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and document
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure it meets the objectives identified
in section 15E(r). 927 The intent was to provide flexibility for an NRSRO to establish policies and
procedures that can be integrated with its procedures and methodologies for determining credit
ratings, which vary across NRSROs. 928 The proposed approach also was sensitive to the
limitation in section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act, given that the objectives set forth in section
15E(r) of the Exchange Act relate to the procedures and methodologies an NRSRO uses to
determine credit ratings. 929 The Commission also proposed an amendment to Rule 17g-2 to
apply the record retention and production requirements of that rule to the documentation of the
policies and procedures that would be required under proposed paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8. 930
926

The objectives are: (1) to ensure that credit ratings are determined using procedures and methodologies,
including qualitative and quantitative data and models, that are (A) approved by the board of the NRSRO
or a body performing a similar function; and (B) in accordance with the policies and procedures of the
NRSRO for the development and modification of credit rating procedures and methodologies; (2) to ensure
that when material changes to credit rating procedures and methodologies (including changes to qualitative
and quantitative data and models) are made, that (A) the changes are applied consistently to all credit
ratings to which the changed procedures and methodologies apply; (B) to the extent that changes are made
to credit rating surveillance procedures and methodologies, the changes are applied to then-current credit
ratings by the NRSRO within a reasonable time period determined by the Commission, by rule; and (C) the
NRSRO publicly discloses the reason for the change; and (3) to notify users of credit ratings (A) of the
version of a procedure or methodology, including the qualitative methodology or quantitative inputs, used
with respect to a particular credit rating; (B) when a material change is made to a procedure or
methodology, including to a qualitative model or quantitative inputs; (C) when a significant error is
identified in a procedure or methodology, including a qualitative or quantitative model, that may result in
credit rating actions; and (D) of the likelihood of a material change described in subparagraph (B) resulting
in a change in current credit ratings. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(r)(1) through (3).

the Exchange Act (which addresses notice of the version of a procedure or methodology used with respect
to a particular credit rating) also through paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. See Nationally

Paragraph (a) of New Rule 17g-8

As proposed, paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 would require an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure
that it achieves the objectives identified in section 15E(r) of the Exchange Act. 931 In particular,
the prefatory text of paragraph (a) would require an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that it meets the
objectives identified in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5). 932 The rule text in proposed
paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of Rule 17g-8 largely mirrored the statutory text of section
15E(r) of the Exchange Act. 933
The Commission is adopting the prefatory text of paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 as
proposed. 934 The final rule requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and document
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it meets the objectives identified in
paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of the rule.
One commenter stated that the proposal appropriately recognizes that procedures and
methodologies vary across NRSROs and thus there is a need for flexibility to establish policies
and procedures that can be integrated with the NRSRO’s existing credit rating methodologies. 935

financial institutions with a track record of issuing poor quality assets. See Levin Letter. This

these commenters stated that certain aspects of the proposals, including those regarding credit
rating methodologies, would compound barriers to entry, and that many of the rules would be
expensive and burdensome to implement. 937 More specifically, this commenter stated that the
Commission should take into account the dominance of very large players and expand
exemptions for small NRSROs designed to level the competitive field. 938
In response, the Commission notes that the final rule is designed to meet the rulemaking
mandate of section 15E(r) of the Exchange Act in a manner that provides flexibility to NRSROs
to design the required policies and procedures. Consequently, an NRSRO can tailor and scale its
policies and procedures to its business model, size, and the scope of its activities as well as to its
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings, which should mitigate concerns to
some degree about the costs of the final rule and its potential to create barriers to entry for small
credit rating agencies. The Commission also believes that the policies and procedures required
under section 15E(r), as implemented by the Commission in paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8, will
promote the integrity and transparency of the procedures and methodologies NRSROs use to
determine credit ratings by, for example, promoting board oversight of these procedures and
methodologies and requiring disclosure when material changes are made to them. Nonetheless,
as discussed below in the economic analysis, the Commission acknowledges that these
requirements will result in costs and that those costs could create competitive barriers.

recommendation is beyond the scope of the proposal and could implicate section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange
Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(2) (which, among other things, prohibits the Commission from regulating the
substance of credit ratings and the procedures and methodologies by which any NRSRO determines credit
ratings).

As proposed, paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-8 would implement section 15E(r)(1)(A) of
the Exchange Act. 939 This section identifies the objective of ensuring that credit ratings are
determined using procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and
models, that are approved by the board of the NRSRO, or a body performing a function similar
to that of a board. 940 Paragraph (a)(1), as proposed, would require an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that
credit ratings are determined using procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and
quantitative data and models, that are approved by the board of the NRSRO, or a body
performing a function similar to that of a board. 941 The Commission intended this requirement
to operate in conjunction with section 15E(t)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act, which establishes a
statutory requirement that the board of an NRSRO “shall oversee” the establishment,
maintenance, and enforcement of the policies and procedures for determining credit ratings. 942
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed. 943 The final
rule requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure
that the procedures and methodologies it uses to determine credit ratings are approved by its
board of directors or a body performing a function similar to that of a board of directors. 944 In
relation to this requirement in paragraph (a)(1), section 15E(t)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act (as
discussed above) contains a self-executing requirement that the board of an NRSRO “shall

oversee” the “establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of the policies and procedures for
determining credit ratings.” 945 Consequently, as discussed in the proposing release, the policies
and procedures required pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted, must be
reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO’s board carries out this statutorily mandated
responsibility. 946 In addition, section 15E(t)(5) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission may permit an NRSRO to delegate responsibilities required in section 15E(t) to a
committee if the Commission finds that compliance with the provisions of that section present an
unreasonable burden on a small NRSRO. 947 In this case, the policies and procedures required
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted, must be reasonably designed to ensure
the NRSRO’s committee carries out the responsibility to oversee the establishment, maintenance,
and enforcement of the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for determining credit
ratings. 948
One commenter stated that the proposal appropriately meets the Exchange Act
mandate. 949 Another commenter cited the high costs associated with having an independent
board and stated that given those high costs the scope of board functions should not be
inadvertently expanded. 950 This commenter also stated that it would have been helpful for the
final rule to provide greater guidance to confirm that the board is not required to approve or pass
judgment on, for example, “qualitative and quantitative data and models.” 951 A second

commenter stated that a periodic approval process is more consistent with the board of directors’
oversight role and provides the board of directors a better opportunity to provide well-planned
and meaningful guidance that would be better at creating consistency in best practices across the
NRSRO. 952 A third commenter stated that responsibility for the development of ratings criteria,
methodologies, and models “should be in the hands of experienced ratings professionals” and
that the board should be responsible for approving the policies and procedures that are used to
develop the NRSROs’ criteria, methodologies, and models. 953 The commenter did not interpret
the proposal to require the board to approve the criteria, methodologies, or models themselves,
stating that any such requirement would not be feasible given the vast amounts of continually
developing criteria used by NRSROs. 954
In response to the comments, the Commission notes that section 15E(t)(3)(A) of the
Exchange Act provides that the board of an NRSRO shall oversee the establishment,
maintenance, and enforcement of policies and procedures for determining credit ratings. 955
Consequently, the self-executing requirement in the statute governs the responsibility of the
board. Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-8 governs the responsibility of the NRSRO to have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the board carries out this responsibility. In
terms of complying with the statutory requirement to oversee rating policies and procedures, the
Commission recognizes that the board cannot be involved in managing the day-to-day affairs of
the NRSRO. There must be an appropriate balance between the board’s responsibilities as a
governing body and the responsibilities of the NRSRO’s managers as supervisors of the daily

264

activities of the NRSRO. As a practical matter, an NRSRO will need to appropriately allocate
responsibilities to the NRSRO’s board and to the NRSRO’s managers with respect to the
implementation of rating procedures and methodologies, with the board exercising its statutory
responsibility to oversee the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of the NRSRO’s
policies and procedures for determining credit ratings. Consequently, the Commission does not
expect board members to undertake the detailed work of developing rating procedures and
methodologies.
Further, as discussed above, section 15E(t)(5) of the Exchange Act provides exception
authority under which the Commission may permit an NRSRO to delegate responsibilities of the
board required in section 15E(t) to a committee if the Commission finds that compliance with the
provisions of that section present an unreasonable burden on a small NRSRO. 956 The ability to
request an exception under section 15E(t)(5) provides a means for a small NRSRO to seek relief
to delegate responsibilities to a committee if the potential costs and burdens associated with the
requirements of section 15E(t) of the Exchange Act – including the requirement that the board
oversee the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of the policies and procedures for
determining credit ratings – are an unreasonable burden. 957
Commenters also questioned whether the board of directors would need to have members
with expertise in rating methodologies. 958 One of these commenters stated that the rule should
require the NRSRO to appoint at least one board member with quantitative financial analysis

956

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(t)(5).

957

The Commission will respond to such requests in a manner similar to requests for relief under section 36 of
the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78mm. Further information about requesting relief under section 36 of
the Exchange Act is available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/exempt.shtml.

958

See, e.g., AFSCME Letter (expressing concerns that the board may not possess the necessary expertise,
particularly in quantitative analysis, to carry out the oversight function specified in paragraph (a)(1) of Rule
17g-8); COPERA Letter (expressing similar concerns); Morningstar Letter.

265

expertise. 959 Section 15E(t)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act, while mandating that the NRSRO’s
board must “oversee” the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of the NRSRO’s policies
and procedures for determining credit ratings, does not address whether the board must include a
member with specific expertise in this area. 960 Similarly, section 15E(r)(1)(A) of the Exchange
also does not address board expertise and, consequently, neither does paragraph (a)(1) of Rule
17g-8. 961 In complying with the statute and rule, an NRSRO and its shareholders will need to
strike an appropriate balance between board members who have generalized experience and
those who have more specific experience with aspects of the NRSRO’s business activities,
including with rating methodologies.
Paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would implement section 15E(r)(1)(B) of
the Exchange Act. 962 This section identifies the objective of ensuring that credit ratings are
determined using procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and
models, that are in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NRSRO for the
development and modification of credit rating procedures and methodologies. 963 As proposed,
paragraph (a)(2) would require an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and document policies
and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the procedures and methodologies, including
qualitative and quantitative data and models, that the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings are
developed and modified in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NRSRO. 964

See AFSCME Letter.

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(t)(3)(A). The statute does require the NRSRO to have independent board members,

The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-8 as proposed. 965 Section
15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act requires an NRSRO to “establish, maintain, enforce, and
document an effective internal control structure governing the implementation of and adherence
to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining credit ratings.” 966 Consequently,
section 15E(c)(3)(A) establishes a statutory requirement that an NRSRO have an internal control
structure that governs the implementation of rating procedures and methodologies. 967 In
addition, paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-8 establishes a complementary requirement that an
NRSRO have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that rating procedures and
methodologies are developed and modified in accordance with the NRSRO’s procedures for
developing and modifying rating procedures and methodologies. 968
Two commenters supported the proposal. 969 In contrast, one commenter suggested the
Commission take a different approach than was proposed in paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-8. 970
Specifically, this commenter recommended that the rule establish a “committee assessment
function” devoted to analyzing the performance of rating committees. 971 In response, the
Commission notes that the rulemaking mandate in section 15E(r)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act
addresses ensuring that the NRSRO uses rating procedures and methodologies that are in
accordance with the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for developing and modifying
such procedures and methodologies. 972 In other words, the statute is concerned with ensuring

that the NRSRO follows its processes for developing and modifying rating procedures and
methodologies. The commenter’s suggestion for a committee assessment function addresses the
performance of rating committees in determining credit ratings (that is, in applying the rating
procedures and methodologies). Consequently, the Commission considers the commenter’s
proposal outside the scope of this rulemaking.
Paragraph (a)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would implement section 15E(r)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act. 973 This section identifies the objective of ensuring that, when material
changes are made to rating procedures and methodologies (including changes to qualitative and
quantitative data and models), the changes are applied consistently to all credit ratings to which
the changed procedures and methodologies apply. 974 As proposed, paragraph (a)(3)(i) would
require an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that material changes to the procedures and methodologies,
including changes to qualitative and quantitative data and models, the NRSRO uses to determine
credit ratings are applied consistently to all credit ratings to which the changed procedures and
methodologies apply. 975
Paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would implement section 15E(r)(2)(B) of
the Exchange Act. 976 This section identifies the objective of ensuring that when material
changes are made to rating procedures and methodologies (including changes to qualitative and
quantitative data and models), to the extent that changes are made to credit rating surveillance

procedures and methodologies, the changes are applied to then-current credit ratings by the
NRSRO within a reasonable time period determined by the Commission, by rule. 977 As
proposed, paragraph (a)(3)(ii) would require an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that material changes to the
procedures and methodologies, including changes to qualitative and quantitative data and
models, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings are, to the extent that the changes are to
surveillance or monitoring procedures and methodologies, applied to then-current credit ratings
within a reasonable period of time taking into consideration the number of ratings impacted, the
complexity of the procedures and methodologies used to determine the credit ratings, and the
type of obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated. 978 The proposed rule text
differed from the text of section 15E(r)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act because it provided that the
changes must be applied to then-current credit ratings within a reasonable period of time taking
into consideration the number of credit ratings impacted, the complexity of the procedures and
methodologies used to determine the credit ratings, and the type of obligor, security, or money
market instrument being rated. 979
The Commission is adopting paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of Rule 17g-8 with
modifications to paragraph (a)(3)(i) to clarify the requirements of the rule in response to
comment. 980 Specifically, one commenter stated that the provision appropriately meets the
requirements of the Exchange Act but asked the Commission to clarify that paragraph (a)(3)(i) is

Commission, by rule. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33453-33454.

applicable only to changes to procedures and methodologies that may impact new credit ratings,
and that the implementation of changes affecting existing ratings are addressed separately in
paragraph (a)(3)(ii). 981 The commenter’s interpretation of paragraph (a)(3)(i) is incorrect. The
Commission intended this paragraph to address the procedures and methodologies an NRSRO
uses to determine new credit ratings and to make adjustments to current credit ratings.
Otherwise, the policies and procedures required under paragraph (a)(3)(i) would not address the
consistent treatment of current credit ratings. However, to remove any ambiguity, the text of
paragraph (a)(3)(i) has been modified to clarify that the paragraph applies to “current and future
credit ratings.” 982
Another commenter questioned whether the provision was appropriate given the
commenter’s view that an NRSRO cannot ensure that changes are applied consistently to all
credit ratings to which the changed procedures and methodologies apply because qualitative
assessments differ from credit rating committee to credit rating committee. 983 The Commission
acknowledges that rating procedures and methodologies commonly incorporate qualitative
analysis that introduces a degree of subjectivity to the rating process. The final rule is not
intended to interfere with the qualitative process that is part of determining a credit rating.
Rather, it is designed to ensure that an NRSRO does not apply different rating procedures and
methodologies when determining credit ratings with respect to types of obligors or obligations
that are intended to be subject to the same rating procedures and methodologies. If, for example,
an NRSRO changes a rating procedure or methodology for determining initial credit ratings for
RMBS, the policies and procedures of the NRSRO must be reasonably designed to ensure that

981

See S&P Letter.

982

See paragraph (a)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-8.

983

See Harrington Letter.

270

the NRSRO does not continue to use the old procedure or methodology to determine initial credit
ratings for some RMBS and the new procedure or methodology to determine initial credit ratings
for other RMBS. 984
The Commission is making modifications to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of Rule 17g-8 from the
rule text as proposed. 985 As stated above, one commenter asked the Commission to clarify that
paragraph (a)(3)(i) is applicable only to changes to procedures and methodologies that may
impact new credit ratings, and that the implementation of changes affecting current ratings are
addressed separately in paragraph (a)(3)(ii). 986 As discussed above, the commenter’s
interpretation of paragraph (a)(3)(i) was not correct and the paragraph has been modified to
clarify that it applies to current and future credit ratings. However, the commenter is correct that
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) was intended to apply to current credit ratings. Specifically, the Commission
intended paragraph (a)(3)(ii) to address the timeframe in which an NRSRO must apply an
updated procedure or methodology for performing surveillance or monitoring of credit ratings to
current credit ratings to which the changed procedure or methodology applies. For example, if
the NRSRO changes the methodology for monitoring credit ratings of RMBS, paragraph (a)(3)(i)
of the final rule requires the firm to have policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to
ensure that it uses the updated methodology to monitor all RMBS credit ratings going
forward. 987 The change in methodology, however, may require the NRSRO to adjust the current
credit ratings assigned to RMBS. Paragraph (a)(3)(ii), as proposed, was intended to address the

984

Similarly, if the NRSRO changes a procedure or methodology for monitoring credit ratings of RMBS, the
policies and procedures of the NRSRO under paragraph (a)(3)(i) must be reasonably designed to ensure
that it does not continue to use the old procedure or methodology to monitor some RMBS and the new
procedure or methodology to monitor other RMBS.

timeframe in which an NRSRO must apply the updated methodology to current credit ratings to
determine whether they should be adjusted. The Commission has modified the text of paragraph
(a)(3)(ii) to make this more clear. Specifically, the final rule requires an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that
material changes to the procedures and methodologies, including changes to qualitative and
quantitative data and models, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings are, to the extent that
the changes are to surveillance or monitoring procedures and methodologies, applied to current
credit ratings to which the changed procedures or methodologies apply within a reasonable
period of time, taking into consideration the number of credit ratings impacted, the complexity of
the procedures and methodologies used to determine the credit ratings, and the type of obligor,
security, or money market instrument being rated. 988
One commenter asked for clarification as to what time period constitutes a “reasonable
period” for applying changed surveillance or monitoring procedures and methodologies to
current credit ratings. 989 Two commenters supported the decision not to prescribe a timeframe
given the variables surrounding such a change (for example, number of impacted credit
ratings). 990 Another commenter acknowledged the need for flexibility with respect to the
timeframe but expressed the concern that absent any guidance there would continue to be
insufficient resources made available for surveillance and monitoring of credit ratings. 991 Two
commenters argued that the Commission must establish a firm deadline for the application of
revised rating methodologies or surveillance procedures to current credit ratings to ensure

272

NRSROs act promptly. 992 Another commenter, more generally, urged the Commission to
require prompt re-testing after the NRSRO makes any such material changes. 993
In response to the comments that the rule should prescribe a specific timeframe in which
the review must take place or prescribe what constitutes a reasonable period of time, the
Commission is not persuaded that doing so would be feasible or appropriate. For example, some
NRSROs have hundreds of thousands of credit ratings outstanding in certain classes of credit
ratings, whereas others have fewer than one thousand. 994 Consequently, if the specified
timeframe was too short, an NRSRO with a large number of credit ratings might need to rush to
meet the deadline. This could negatively impact the quality of the review of the credit ratings
subject to the changed surveillance or monitoring procedures and methodologies and could result
in adjustments to those credit ratings that were not the result of thorough analysis. If the
specified timeframe was too long, an NRSRO with relatively few credit ratings would have a
“safe harbor” that allowed the firm to act more slowly to apply the changed surveillance
procedures and methodologies to current credit ratings than was necessary. 995 Consequently, the
final rule retains the proposed requirement that the updated surveillance or monitoring procedure
or methodology must be applied to the current credit ratings to which the changed procedure or
methodology applies within a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the number of
credit ratings impacted, the complexity of the procedures and methodologies used to determine
the credit ratings, and the type of obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated. The
question of whether the NRSRO has acted within a reasonable period of time will depend on

273

factors such as the number of credit ratings an NRSRO has outstanding that would be impacted
by the change.
Another commenter stated that the Commission should clarify the manner in which
changes in rating procedures and methodologies would apply to current credit ratings. 996 More
specifically, the commenter explained that proposed paragraph (a)(3)(i) of Rule 17g-8 did not
address whether an NRSRO applying changed procedures or methodologies to outstanding credit
ratings must re-rate the transaction based upon the information available at the time of the initial
rating or whether the process should include performance information received after that time. 997
The commenter also stated that the NRSRO should not apply changes in procedures or
methodologies to current credit ratings without a change in the performance of the credit
rating. 998 In response, the Commission notes that the final rule does not require the NRSRO to
adjust the outstanding credit ratings impacted by the changed rating procedure or methodology;
nor does it specify on what basis an NRSRO should adjust an outstanding credit rating. 999
Rather, it requires the NRSRO to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that changes to surveillance or monitoring procedures and methodologies are applied to current
credit ratings to which the changed procedures or methodologies apply within a reasonable
timeframe. The question of whether an outstanding credit rating must be adjusted after the
application of the changed procedures or methodologies will depend solely on the NRSRO’s
procedures and methodologies. Based on those procedures and methodologies, the NRSRO may

As discussed above, in implementing section 15E(r) of the Exchange Act, the Commission has been
sensitive to the limitation in section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(2) (which,
among other things, prohibits the Commission from regulating the substance of credit ratings and the
procedures and methodologies by which any NRSRO determines credit ratings).

adjust an existing credit rating because of the change in the procedure or methodology, because
of a change in circumstances that impacts the creditworthiness of the obligor or issuer that is
subject to the credit rating, or a combination of these factors. This decision, however, will be
based solely on the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies. 1000
Paragraph (a)(4)(i) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would implement sections 15E(r)(2)(C),
15E(r)(3)(B), and 15E(r)(3)(D) of the Exchange Act. 1001 Section 15E(r)(2)(C) identifies the
objective of ensuring that when material changes are made to rating procedures and
methodologies (including changes to qualitative and quantitative data and models), the NRSRO
publicly discloses the reason for the change. 1002 Section 15E(r)(3)(B) identifies the objective of
ensuring that an NRSRO notifies users of credit ratings when a material change is made to a
procedure or methodology, including to a qualitative model or quantitative input. 1003 Section
15E(r)(3)(D) identifies the objective of ensuring that the NRSRO notifies users of credit ratings
when a material change is made to a procedure or methodology, including to a qualitative model
or quantitative input, of the likelihood the change will result in a change in current credit
ratings. 1004 The Commission proposed to implement these sections in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of Rule
17g-8, which would require an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and document policies
and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO promptly publishes on an easily
accessible portion of its corporate Internet website material changes to the procedures and
methodologies, including to qualitative models or quantitative inputs, the NRSRO uses to

changes to any “current ratings.” 1005
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(4)(i) of Rule 17g-8 with a minor modification
to make terminology throughout the rule consistent. 1006 As adopted, paragraph (a)(4)(i) requires
the NRSRO to have policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the
NRSRO promptly publishes on an easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website
material changes to the procedures and methodologies, including to qualitative models or
quantitative inputs, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings, the reason for the changes, and
the likelihood the changes will result in changes to any current credit ratings. 1007
Paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would implement section 15E(r)(3)(C) of
the Exchange Act. 1008 This section provides that the Commission’s rules shall require an
NRSRO to notify users of credit ratings when a significant error is identified in a procedure or
methodology, including a qualitative or quantitative model, that may result in credit rating
actions. 1009 As proposed, paragraph (a)(4)(ii) would require the NRSRO to establish, maintain,
enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO
promptly publishes on an easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website significant
errors identified in a procedure or methodology, including a qualitative or quantitative model, the
NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings that may result in a change in the current ratings. 1010

The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 17g-8 with a minor
modification. As proposed, the rule provided, in pertinent part, that the NRSRO must publish
“significant errors” identified in a rating procedure or methodology. The proposal was intended
to notify users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings when a significant error is identified. 1011 One
potential reading of the text, however, was that it required publication of the actual error. This
was not intended. Further, publication of the error without context – rather than notification that
an error was identified – could diminish the value of the disclosure. For example, if the error
was in the code of a quantitative model, the disclosure of the code containing the error without
identifying that it contained an error likely would not inform users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings
that there was an error. Consequently, the final rule is modified to provide for the prompt
publication of notice of the existence of a significant error. More specifically, the final rule
requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that
the NRSRO promptly publishes on an easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website
notice of the existence of a significant error identified in a procedure or methodology, including
a qualitative or quantitative model, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings that may result in
a change to current credit ratings. 1012
A number of commenters addressed paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed. 1013
Some commenters stated that Internet website publication would help ensure that NRSROs
communicate information pertaining to material changes in procedures and methodologies, as
well as significant errors in the procedures and methodologies, to investors and other users of

credit ratings in a timely manner. 1014 One commenter opposed the provision in paragraph (a)(4)
of Rule 17g-8 requiring NRSROs to publish material changes and significant errors on an easily
accessible portion of the NRSRO’s corporate Internet website. 1015 The commenter argued that
the statute requires more direct notification than Internet website publication, which could
include allowing users to sign up for alerts. 1016 The Commission believes that specifying
publication on an easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s Internet website is the most direct
and cost effective way to provide an opportunity for all potentially interested parties to have
access to the required disclosures. 1017 This does not preclude an NRSRO from offering
additional disclosure services such as alerts or third parties from offering alert services based on
the disclosures an NRSRO publishes.
One NRSRO stated that it would be helpful for the Commission to provide guidance as to
when either a material change or significant error would trigger the disclosures. 1018 This
commenter stated that significant errors should be disclosed if there is a reasonable likelihood
that correction of the error will result in a change to current credit ratings. In contrast, another
commenter stated that the Commission should not attempt to define the phrase significant error
as any imposition of an arbitrary definition could result in situations where an NRSRO must
identify errors that are minor and a correction does not result in a rating action. 1019
The question of whether a change is material or an error is significant will depend on the
facts and circumstances and, most importantly, on the impacted rating procedure or methodology

(which vary across NRSROs). In general, the Commission believes that a change to a rating
procedure or methodology would be material if there is a substantial likelihood that reasonable
users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings would find notice of the change important information in
terms of assessing the rating procedure or methodology. 1020 The Commission believes that an
error in a rating procedure or methodology would be significant if there is a substantial
likelihood that reasonable users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings would find notice of the error
important information in terms of assessing the impact the error had on credit ratings determined
using the rating procedure or methodology that contained the error. 1021
Finally, paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would implement section
15E(r)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act. 1022 This section provides that the Commission’s rules shall
require an NRSRO to notify users of credit ratings of the version of a procedure or methodology,
including the qualitative methodology or quantitative inputs, used with respect to a particular
credit rating. 1023 As proposed, paragraph (a)(5) would require the NRSRO to establish, maintain,
enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO
discloses the version of a credit rating procedure or methodology, including the qualitative
methodology or quantitative inputs, used with respect to a particular credit rating. 1024

1020

proposed, as discussed below in section II.G.3. of this release, that disclosure of the version of a credit
rating procedure or methodology be part of the rule implementing section 15E(s) of the Exchange Act. See
15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s). Section 15E(s) specifies, among other things, that the Commission adopt rules
requiring an NRSRO to generate a form to be included with the publication of a credit rating. See

279

The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17g-8 as proposed. 1025
Specifically, the final rule requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to ensure that it discloses the version of a credit rating procedure or
methodology, including the qualitative methodology or quantitative inputs, used with respect to a
particular credit rating. 1026
One commenter requested clarification that the requirement to publish the version of the
criteria used for a particular credit rating applies only when there is an action on the credit rating,
such as an upgrade, downgrade, or withdrawal. 1027 A second commenter stated that the rule
should require the NRSRO to publicly provide, along with the publication of the credit rating,
disclosure about the credit rating and the methodology used to determine it. 1028
The Commission is implementing section 15E(r)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act through
paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17g-8 and paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of Rule 17g-7. Paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(B) of Rule 17g-7, as discussed below in section II.G.3. of this release, requires that the
form to be included with the publication of certain rating actions include a disclosure of the
version of the credit rating procedure or methodology used to determine the credit rating. 1029
The policies and procedures required by paragraph (a)(5) of Rule 17g-8 must address the
NRSRO’s compliance with the disclosure requirement in Rule 17g-7. In response to the
comments about when the version of the credit rating procedure or methodology used to
determine the credit rating must be disclosed, Rule 17g-7 specifies when the form containing the

credit rating must be published by the NRSRO: upon the taking of one of the rating actions
identified in the rule (for example, an initial credit rating or an upgrade or a downgrade of an
outstanding credit rating). 1030
A third commenter expressed concern that the proposal would provide NRSROs with a
defense for developing poor opinions on creditworthiness. 1031 More specifically, the commenter
stated that, based on his experience, reference to published methodologies has given at least one
NRSRO a defense for having formed poor opinions on CDOs and RMBS. 1032 The commenter
also questioned the underlying rationale of the rule insofar as NRSRO methodologies are already
freely accessible and transparent. 1033 In response, the Commission notes that the statutory
directive is clear: the rule must require each NRSRO to notify users of credit ratings of the
version of a procedure or methodology, including the qualitative methodology or quantitative
inputs, used with respect to a particular credit rating. 1034 To address the commenter’s concern,
the Commission would need to do the opposite and prohibit an NRSRO from notifying users of
credit ratings of the version of a procedure or methodology, including the qualitative
methodology or quantitative inputs, used with respect to a particular credit rating. This would be
inconsistent with the statutory requirement that the rule provide for notification.

NRSROs’ compliance with paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8. The record must be retained until three

amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 discussed above in section II.A.2. of this release. 1038

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the specific amendments
and new rule relating to credit rating methodologies. 1039 The economic baseline that existed
before today’s amendments was one in which an NRSRO’s board of directors must oversee the
establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of the NRSRO’s policies and procedures for
determining credit ratings pursuant to Exchange Act section 15E(t)(3)(A). 1040 The baseline that
existed before today’s amendments and new rule also was one in which NRSROs must establish,
maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure governing the
implementation of and adherence to their methodologies for determining credit ratings. 1041

1035

See paragraph (b)(13) of Rule 17g-2, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations,
76 FR at 33539. See also section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, which requires an NRSRO to make and
keep such records, and make and disseminate such reports, as the Commission prescribes by rule as
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78q(a)(1).

282

NRSROs – under the baseline requirements – were not explicitly required to establish,
maintain, enforce, document, and retain a record of policies and procedures relating to: (1) board
approval of the procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings; 1042 (2) the
development and modification of the procedures and methodologies for determining credit
ratings; 1043 (3) applying material changes to the procedures and methodologies for determining
credit ratings; 1044 (4) publishing material changes to and notices of significant errors in the
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings; 1045 and (5) disclosing the version a
procedure or methodology for determining credit ratings used with respect to a particular credit
rating. 1046
Relative to this baseline, the Commission believes that the amendments and new rule
may result in a number of benefits. For example, implementing policies and procedures
designed to ensure that the NRSRO’s board of directors (or a body performing a similar
function) oversees the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of the NRSRO’s policies
and procedures for determining credit ratings in accordance with 15E(t)(3)(A) of the Exchange
Act should promote the quality and consistency of the procedures and methodologies. Similarly,
taking steps to ensure that the procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings are
developed and modified pursuant to the NRSRO’s policies and procedures also should promote
the quality and consistency of the procedures and methodologies.

1042

See paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-8.

1043

See paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-8. As noted above, an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and

283

Taking steps to ensure that material changes to the procedures and methodologies the
NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings are applied consistently to all current and future credit
ratings to which the changed procedures or methodologies apply should help ensure consistent
and timely application of such changes and promote the integrity of the credit rating process.
This should benefit users of credit ratings. In addition, taking steps to ensure that an NRSRO
promptly publishes on an easily accessible portion of its Internet website information about
material changes to the procedures and methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit
ratings, the reason for the changes, and the likelihood the changes will result in changes to any
current credit ratings should benefit investors and other users of credit ratings by increasing the
transparency of the NRSROs’ credit rating activities and providing additional information with
which to assess the quality of a given NRSRO’s credit rating processes. Similarly, taking steps
to ensure that an NRSRO promptly publishes on an easily accessible portion of its corporate
Internet website notice of the existence of a significant error identified in a procedure or
methodology used to determine credit ratings also should benefit investors and other users of
credit ratings by increasing the transparency of the NRSROs’ credit rating activities and
providing additional information with which to assess the quality of a given NRSRO’s credit
rating processes.
The records NRSROs must keep pursuant to Rule 17g-2 will be used by Commission
examiners to evaluate whether a given NRSRO’s policies and procedures are reasonably
designed and the NRSRO is complying with them. Compliance with these policies and
procedures may increase the likelihood that NRSROs apply sound procedures and methodologies
consistently to all applicable credit ratings and inform investors of these procedures and
methodologies.

284

Relative to the baseline, the Commission anticipates that the final rule will result in costs.
NRSROs will need to expend resources to develop, document, enforce, and periodically modify
the policies and procedures they establish pursuant to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8.
As stated above, some commenters opposed the proposed rule on the basis of cost. 1047
One of these commenters stated that certain aspects of the proposals, including those regarding
credit rating methodologies, would compound barriers to entry, and that many of the rules would
be expensive and burdensome to implement. 1048 More specifically, this commenter stated that
the Commission should take into account the dominance of very large players and expand small
NRSRO exemptions designed to level the competitive field. 1049
In response, the Commission acknowledges that these requirements will result in costs,
which could create competitive barriers. However, the Commission reiterates that the final rule
is designed to meet the rulemaking mandate in section 15E(r) of the Exchange Act in a manner
that provides flexibility to NRSROs in terms of designing the required policies and procedures.
Consequently, an NRSRO can tailor its policies and procedures to its business model, size, and
the scope of its activities as well as to its methodologies and procedures for determining credit
ratings, which, to some degree, may mitigate concerns about the costs of the final rule and its
potential to create barriers to entry for small credit rating agencies. These costs would likely be
higher for NRSROs with more complex operations in terms of the quantity of credit ratings they
issue, the different types of credit ratings they issue, and the number of locations from which
they determine and issue credit ratings. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the
Commission estimates that paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 will result in total industry-wide one-

1047

1048

1049

See Kroll Letter.

285

time costs to NRSROs of approximately $566,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to
NRSROs of approximately $142,000. 1050
Relative to the baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-2 prescribing retention
requirements for the documentation of the policies and procedures will result in costs to
NRSROs. NRSROs already have recordkeeping systems in place to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements in Rule 17g-2 before today’s amendments. Therefore, the
recordkeeping costs of this rule will be incremental to the costs associated with these existing
requirements. Specifically, the incremental costs will consist largely of updating their record
retention policies and procedures and retaining and producing the additional record. Based on
analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that paragraph (b)(13) of Rule 17g2 and the amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 will result in total industry-wide one-time
costs to NRSROs of approximately $12,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of
approximately $3,000. 1051
The Commission believes that NRSROs will incur costs to apply material changes to
ratings procedures and methodologies consistently to all current credit ratings to which the
changed procedures or methodologies apply. This cost will likely vary significantly per
occurrence depending on the number of credit ratings and the type of instruments affected by the
change as well as the nature and extent of the change. In addition, the Commission believes that
an NRSRO will incur costs when promptly publishing on an easily accessible portion of its
Internet website information about material changes to procedures and methodologies, the
1050

See section V.G. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs
identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.7. of this release.

1051

See section V.G. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs

286

likelihood such changes will result in changes to any current ratings, and notice of significant
errors identified in a procedure or methodology in accordance with paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii)
of Rule 17g-8. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that
paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii) of Rule 17g-8 will result in costs to NRSROs of approximately
$5,700 per publication on their website. 1052
A possible additional cost is that the final rule potentially could decrease the quality of
credit ratings in circumstances where the subjective judgment of participants in the rating
process could improve the quality of ratings. In order to ensure that material changes to ratings
procedures and methodologies are applied consistently to all current credit ratings to which the
changed procedures or methodologies apply “within a reasonable timeframe” in accordance with
the new rule, an NRSRO may establish credit rating procedures and methodologies that diminish
the ability of participants in the rating process to exercise subjective judgment, which could
lengthen the rating process. As a result, the credit ratings may not benefit fully from the
expertise of the analysts in the rating process, which could negatively impact the quality of the
credit rating. This concern may be mitigated by the fact that the new rule does not require that
the policies and procedures specify a specific timeframe to apply the changed procedure or
methodology but rather requires that the change to be applied within a reasonable period of time,
taking into consideration the number of credit ratings impacted, the complexity of the procedures
and methodologies used to determine the credit ratings, and the type of obligor, security, or
money market instrument being rated.

1052

See section V.G. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
cost per publication is determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs identified
in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.7. of this release.

287

The amendments and new rule should have a number of effects related to efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 1053 First, these amendments could improve the quality and
consistency of credit ratings as well as increasing the information available to users of credit
ratings regarding rating procedures and methodologies. As a result, users of credit ratings could
make more efficient investment decisions based on this higher-quality information. Market
efficiency also could improve if this information is reflected in asset prices. Consequently,
capital formation could improve as capital may flow to more efficient uses with the benefit of
this enhanced information. Alternatively, the quality of credit ratings may decrease in certain
circumstances if an NRSRO establishes credit rating procedures and methodologies that diminish
the ability of participants in the rating process to exercise subjective judgment. In this case, the
quality of credit ratings may decrease, which could decrease the efficiency of investment
decisions made by users of credit ratings. Market efficiency and capital formation may also be
adversely impacted if lower quality information is reflected in asset prices, which may impede
the flow of capital to efficient uses. These amendments also will result in costs, some of which
may have a component that is fixed in magnitude and does not vary with the size of the NRSRO.
Therefore, the operating costs per credit rating of smaller NRSROs may increase relative to that
of larger NRSROs. Consequently, the costs associated with these amendments may have a
disproportionate impact on smaller NRSROs as suggested by commenters, 1054 creating adverse
effects on competition. For example, one commenter suggested that these requirements would
require an NRSRO to review credit rating methodologies, which would place an undue burden

1053

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

1054

See A.M. Best Letter; Kroll Letter.

288

on smaller NRSROs. 1055 As a result of these amendments, the barriers to entry for credit rating
agencies to register as an NRSRO might be higher for credit rating agencies, while some
NRSROs, particularly smaller firms, may decide to withdraw from registration as an NRSRO.
As discussed earlier, these costs also will depend on the complexity of operations within the
NRSRO.
Commenters have proposed a number of alternatives to the final rule. One alternative
would be to require that NRSROs permit users of an NRSRO’s credit ratings to sign up for alerts
regarding material changes and significant errors in an NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies,
which, according to the commenter, “would significantly improve communication.” 1056 As
stated above, the Commission believes that publication on an easily accessible portion of the
NRSRO’s Internet website is the most direct and cost effective way to ensure that all potentially
interested parties have access to the required disclosures. Therefore, this alternative without a
requirement to also disclose the information on the NRSRO’s Internet website could potentially
have the result that fewer users of credit ratings are informed of changes and errors. For
example, certain users of credit ratings may opt not to sign up for e-mail notification in order to
avoid receiving unwanted communications.
Another alternative would be for the Commission to establish a firm deadline for the
application of revised rating methodologies or surveillance or monitoring procedures to current
credit ratings to ensure that NRSROs act promptly, as suggested by commenters. 1057 As stated
above, the Commission is not persuaded that prescribing a specific timeframe in which the
review must take place is feasible or appropriate. For example, some NRSROs have hundreds of

1055

See A.M. Best Letter.

1056

See CFA/AFR Letter.

1057

See Better Markets Letter; CFA/AFR Letter.

289

thousands of credit ratings outstanding in certain classes of credit ratings, while others have
fewer than one thousand. 1058 In addition, there is variation across NRSROs in the level of
resources available to apply these changes. For example, the number of credit analysts employed
by each NRSRO ranges from fewer than ten to more than a thousand. 1059 Consequently,
mandating a timeframe that is too short could negatively impact the quality of the review of the
credit ratings subject to the changed surveillance or monitoring procedures and methodologies
and could result in adjustments to those credit ratings that are not the result of thorough analysis.
In this case, this alternative could result in costs for users of credit ratings who may make creditbased decisions using incomplete or inaccurate information. In addition, an NRSRO with
relatively fewer resources to make the required changes might need to incur costs such as hiring
more staff to meet the deadline. If the mandated timeframe were too long, an NRSRO with
relatively greater resources could take longer than necessary to apply the changed surveillance
procedures and methodologies to impacted credit ratings. 1060 In this case, this alternative could
result in costs for users of credit ratings as information would be updated in a less timely fashion
than will be the case under the new rule.

rating was based solely on the merits of the instruments being rated, and that such rating was an
independent evaluation of the risks and merits of the instrument. 1062 Sections 15E(s)(1) through
(4), among other things, contain provisions requiring Commission rulemaking with respect to
disclosures an NRSRO must make with the publication of a credit rating. 1063 The Commission
proposed paragraph (a) to Rule 17g-7, in large part, to implement sections 15E(q) and 15E(s) of
the Exchange Act. 1064
Under the proposal, an NRSRO would be required to publish two items when taking a
rating action: (1) a form containing information about the credit rating resulting from or subject
to the rating action; and (2) any certification of a provider of third-party due diligence services
received by the NRSRO that relates to the credit rating. 1065 The proposal also included
provisions prescribing the format of the form; the content of the form; and an attestation
requirement for the form. 1066 The Commission is adopting paragraph (a) to Rule 17g-7 with
modifications in response to comments. 1067

Paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 – Prefatory Text

Section 15E(s)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall require, by
rule, an NRSRO to prescribe a form to accompany the publication of each credit rating that
discloses: (1) information relating to the assumptions underlying the credit rating procedures and
methodologies; the data that was relied on to determine the credit rating; and if applicable, how
the NRSRO used servicer or remittance reports, and with what frequency, to conduct
surveillance of the credit rating; and (2) information that can be used by investors and other users
of credit ratings to better understand credit ratings in each class of credit rating issued by the
NRSRO. 1068 Section 15E(s)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act provides that the form shall be made
readily available to users of credit ratings, in electronic or paper form, as the Commission may,
by rule, determine. 1069 Section 15E(s)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission
shall adopt rules requiring an NRSRO at the time it produces a credit rating to disclose any
certifications from providers of third-party due diligence services to the public in a manner that
allows the public to determine the adequacy and level of due diligence services provided by the
third party. 1070
The Commission proposed to implement sections 15E(s)(1), 15E(s)(2)(C), and
15E(s)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act, in large part, through the prefatory text of proposed paragraph
(a) of Rule 17g-7. 1071 As proposed, the prefatory text provided that an NRSRO must publish two

section 15E(s)(1)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act – which relates to the use of servicer or remittance reports –
in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(G) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, because it specifies a particular item of information
that would need to be disclosed in the form. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(a)(1)(i)(G); Nationally Recognized
Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33461.

items when taking a rating action: (1) a form containing information about the credit rating
resulting from or subject to the rating action; 1072 and (2) any certification of a provider of thirdparty due diligence services received by the NRSRO that relates to the credit rating. 1073 The first
sentence of the prefatory text further provided that an NRSRO must publish the form and
certification, as applicable, when taking a rating action with respect to a credit rating assigned to
an obligor, security, or money market instrument in a class of credit ratings for which the
NRSRO is registered. 1074 The second sentence of the prefatory text defined the term rating
action for purposes of the rule to mean any of the following: the publication of an expected or
preliminary credit rating assigned to an obligor, security, or money market instrument before the
publication of an initial credit rating; an initial credit rating; an upgrade or downgrade of an
existing credit rating (including a downgrade to, or assignment of, default); a placement of an
existing credit rating on credit watch or review; an affirmation of an existing credit rating; and a
withdrawal of an existing credit rating. 1075 The third sentence of the prefatory text provided that
the form and any applicable certifications must be published in the same medium and made
available to the same persons who can receive or access the credit rating that is the result of the
rating action or the subject of rating action. 1076

The Commission is adopting the first sentence of the prefatory text of paragraph (a) of
Rule 17g-7 with a modification in response to comment. 1077 As adopted, this sentence provides
that except as provided in paragraph (a)(3), an NRSRO must publish the items described in
paragraphs (a)(1) (the form) and (a)(2) (third-party due diligence certifications), as applicable,
when taking a rating action with respect to a credit rating assigned to an obligor, security, or
money market instrument in a class of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 1078
The Commission is adopting the second sentence of the prefatory text of paragraph (a) of
Rule 17g-7 with modifications to narrow the definition of rating action in response to
comments. 1079 Several commenters stated generally that the proposed definition is overly
broad. 1080 One NRSRO stated that a broad definition of rating action could limit disclosure by
“creating incentives for NRSROs to publish commentary about their credit ratings less
frequently.” 1081 Commenters stated that the proposed definition of rating action would make it
difficult for NRSROs to release their credit ratings in a timely fashion. 1082 One commenter
stated that rating actions involving transaction documents that were finalized before the effective
date of the rules should not be subject to the disclosure requirements. 1083 An NRSRO stated that
the amount of preparation time needed to comply with the rule will likely delay the issuance of
ratings, “particularly with respect to preliminary ratings.” 1084 In contrast, another commenter

1077

See Fitch Letter; prefatory text of paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 (first sentence). The modification, as
discussed below, refers to an exemption the Commission is adopting from the publication requirement for
certain rating actions that relate to a non-U.S. person and transactions that occur overseas. See paragraph
(a)(3) of Rule 17g-7.

stated that including preliminary ratings on asset-backed securities ratings will ensure that
investors receive the information at a time when it is “likely to be most useful to them in making
an investment decision.” 1085
As explained below, commenters urged the Commission to eliminate from the definition
of rating action: preliminary credit ratings; placements of credit ratings on watch or review;
affirmations and confirmations of credit ratings; and withdrawals of credit ratings. 1086
One NRSRO commented that placing a credit rating on review should not be considered
a rating action because a review is simply an indication of the potential for a future rating action,
and is not itself a rating action. 1087 Several commenters stated that some or all rating
affirmations should not be included in the definition of a rating action. 1088 One NRSRO stated
that including rating affirmations would “significantly” increase the reporting burden on
NRSROs, and would produce only a record that there was no change to the rating in question. 1089
The NRSRO also suggested that if affirmations are included, they should refer only to a
published announcement or written confirmation that the rating is being maintained at its current
level. Another commenter stated that affirmations should be excluded unless they represent “a
comprehensive review of a transaction.” 1090 A different commenter stated that a “confirmation,”
which is a type of affirmation that simply indicates that a particular action will not change a

credit rating, should not constitute a rating action because disclosures associated with
confirmations would only cover very minor document changes and add “little value.” 1091
Two commenters stated that some or all withdrawals should not be included in the
definition of a rating action. 1092 One NRSRO stated that publishing the forms for withdrawals
that are “mechanical in nature and not based on a credit assessment or analysis” could make it
more difficult for market participants to locate significant information. 1093
The Commission is sensitive to the burdens imposed by its rules, and in considering the
comments discussed above has sought to balance the need for timely and robust disclosure with
concerns about the costs that would result from the proposal. As discussed below, the
Commission believes it is appropriate to narrow the definition of rating action from the proposed
definition to include those actions that are made at a time when there is limited information about
the rated obligor, security, or money market instrument and to other rating actions if they are
linked to the performance of credit analysis. This will reduce the burden of complying with the
rule. Nonetheless, the Commission recognizes that preparing the form in response to those rating
actions that trigger the disclosure requirement will take time and that this could impact how
quickly an NRSRO is able to publish the credit rating that results from or is the subject of the
rating action. However, the Commission has balanced this concern with the directive of the
statute (that the Commission adopt a rule requiring the form to be published with a credit rating)
and the benefits of the increased transparency the disclosures in the form will provide to users of
the NRSRO’s credit ratings. 1094 Moreover, an NRSRO should be able to draft significant

1093

1094

See, e.g., CFA/AFR Letter (“One reason rating agencies were able to play fast and loose with their own

portions of the form largely in tandem with the credit rating process and, therefore, the form and
the final decision on the rating action generally should be completed simultaneously.
In response to the comment to eliminate preliminary credit ratings from the definition of
rating action, the Commission notes that this type of rating action and certain initial credit ratings
(that is, those assigned to a newly formed obligor or newly issued security or money market
instrument) are made at a time when there is little information available about the rated obligor,
security, or money market instrument. Given the timing of these rating actions, the Commission
agrees with comments that it is critical that investors and other users of credit ratings have access
to the information that is required to be disclosed in the form and any applicable certifications on
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 1095 Consequently, the Commission is adopting the requirement
that the form and certifications be published when the NRSRO publishes a preliminary or
expected credit rating or an initial credit rating. 1096

the users of those ratings about the assumptions that lay behind them or the data on which they were based.
Dodd-Frank includes provisions to address this problem by requiring new disclosures to accompany the
publication of a rating.”).
1095

See CFA/AFR Letter (“Importantly, the Commission proposes to include preliminary ratings among the
actions that would trigger the required disclosures. We strongly support this approach, which is essential to
ensure that investors in ABS get the information at time [sic] when it is likely to be most useful to them in
making an investment decision.”). As the Commission explained when adopting Rule 17g-7, the definition
of credit rating in the note to the rule was designed to address pre-sale reports, which are typically issued
by an NRSRO with respect to an asset-backed security at the time the issuer commences the offering and
typically include an expected or preliminary rating and a summary of the important features of a
transaction. See Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4503-4505 (Jan. 26, 2011). Consequently,
disclosure at the time of issuance of a pre-sale report is particularly important to investors, since such
reports provide them with important information prior to the point at which they make an investment
decision. See id.

1096

See prefatory text of paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 (second sentence). The Commission requested comment
in the proposing release as to whether the disclosures required by the proposed rule in the context of a new
offering should be provided no later than at least five business days in advance of the first sale of securities
in the offering. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33457. In response,
an NRSRO stated that requiring disclosures in a fixed timeframe is “unrealistic” because NRSROs often
receive their information after the prospectus is filed and frequently assign ratings well after the actual
closing and first sale of a transaction. S&P Letter. Another NRSRO and a commenter stated that the five
business day requirement could potentially delay many issuances. See DBRS Letter; FSR Letter. In
contrast, one commenter recommended that the Commission adopt the five business day requirement. See
CFA/AFR Letter. The Commission believes at this time that the five business day requirement could raise

297

Some of the types of rating actions included in the proposed definition are not necessarily
linked to the performance of credit analysis. In particular, placements of credit ratings on watch
or review, certain types of affirmations of credit ratings, and certain types of withdrawals of
credit ratings are not based on the NRSRO applying its rating procedures or methodologies and
making a credit rating determination. In the case of a watch or review, the rating action precedes
the application of the rating procedure or methodology, which, once completed, may result in an
affirmation or an adjustment (upgrade or downgrade) to the credit rating. However, not all credit
rating affirmations are based on the NRSRO applying its rating procedures and
methodologies. 1097 Similarly, NRSROs withdraw credit ratings for a number of reasons that are
unrelated to the performance of credit analysis, including that the obligation was paid off or the
obligor stopped paying to be rated. 1098
In balancing the concerns of commenters about the burden of the rule against the need for
timely and robust disclosure, the Commission, as stated above, believes it is appropriate to focus
the disclosure requirement on rating actions that are based on the application of the NRSRO’s
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings. In this regard, much of the
information required to be disclosed in the form under section 15E(s)(3) of the Exchange Act
relates to the procedures, methodologies, and information used to determine the credit rating. 1099

practical issues and, therefore, is not adopting such a requirement. Consequently, the NRSRO must publish
the form and any certifications at the same time the NRSRO publishes the result of the rating action.
1097

See ASF Letter (stating that a “rating agency consent” or “rating agency confirmation” simply confirms
that a specific contractual change will not result in adverse effect on an existing rating and arguing that
these “statements do not reflect a comprehensive review of a transaction, unlike the type of review that
would be undertaken in connection with an affirmation of a rating following on the placement of a rating
on watch or review.”).

1098

See Moody’s Letter (stating that the requirement to publish a form should not apply in connection with the
withdrawals of credit ratings that are mechanical in nature and not based on a credit assessment or
analysis).

1099

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s)(3). For example, the required disclosures include: (1) the version of the
methodology used to determine the credit rating; and (2) the main assumptions and principles used in

298

For these reasons, placements of credit ratings on watch or review have been removed from the
definition of rating action. 1100 In addition, the definition provides that an affirmation or
withdrawal is a rating action if the affirmation or withdrawal is the result of a review of the credit
rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument by the NRSRO using its
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings. 1101
For the foregoing reasons, the amendments have been modified from the proposal to
eliminate placements of credit ratings on watch or review from the definition of rating action and
to eliminate from the definition affirmations and withdrawals that are not based on the NRSRO
applying its procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings. Consequently, the
second sentence – as adopted – provides that the term rating action “means any of the following:
the publication of an expected or preliminary credit rating assigned to an obligor, security, or
money market instrument before the publication of an initial credit rating; an initial credit rating;
an upgrade or downgrade of an existing credit rating (including a downgrade to, or assignment
of, default); and an affirmation or withdrawal of an existing credit rating if the affirmation or
withdrawal is the result of a review of the credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or
money market instrument by the NRSRO using applicable procedures and methodologies for
determining credit ratings.” 1102

See prefatory text of paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 (second sentence).

See id. An affirmation that results from a look-back review under paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 would be an
affirmation that is the result of a review of the credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money
market instrument by the NRSRO using its procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings.
In particular, the NRSRO would be applying the procedures required by paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-8 to
promptly determine whether the current credit rating assigned to the obligor, security, or money market
instrument must be revised so that it no longer is influenced by a conflict of interest and is solely a product
of the documented procedures and methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings.

1102

See prefatory text of paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 (second sentence).

299

The Commission is making another modification to the proposed amendments that will
reduce the burden of the adopted rule. Specifically, one NRSRO recommended that the
temporary conditional exemption for foreign transactions from the requirements in paragraph
(a)(3) of Rule 17g-5 be applied to the disclosure requirements in paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7, as
proposed. 1103 The commenter stated that many foreign issuers lack the infrastructure to comply
with the level of disclosure required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7, as
proposed. 1104 The commenter stated further that, without an exemption, “NRSROs either might
be unable to issue a credit rating on non-U.S. securities or must withdraw as an NRSRO in order
to continue rating certain non-U.S. securities.” 1105
The Commission is persuaded that at this time the disclosure requirement should not
apply to rating actions involving credit ratings of obligors or issuers whose securities or money
market instruments will be offered or sold in transactions that occur exclusively outside the
United States. As noted above, one commenter suggested that local laws could impede the
ability of the NRSRO to obtain or disclose information about the issuer in accordance with the
requirements of the proposed amendments. To address these types of concerns, the Commission
is adding paragraph (a)(3) to Rule 17g-7 to provide an exemption from the requirements of
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) for rating actions in which: (1) the rated obligor or issuer of the rated
security or money market instrument is not a U.S. person (as defined under Securities Act Rule

market instrument issued by the rated obligor or the issuer will be offered and sold upon
issuance, and that any underwriter or arranger linked to the security or money market instrument
will effect transactions in the security or money market instrument after issuance, only in
transactions that occur outside the United States. 1107 The wording of the exemption is modeled
closely on the temporary conditional exemption from the requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of
Rule 17g-5 the Commission has granted by order. 1108 As stated above, the Commission is
making a corresponding modification to the first sentence of the prefatory text of paragraph (a)

1106

17 CFR 230.902(k).

1107

See paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17g-7. If the rating action involves a credit rating of an obligor as an entity,
the NRSRO must have a reasonable basis to conclude that any security or money market instrument of the
obligor will be offered and sold upon issuance, and that any underwriter or arranger linked to the security
or money market instrument will effect transactions of the security or money market instrument after
issuance, only in transactions that occur outside the United States. For example, if some securities or
money market instruments issued by the obligor are sold in transactions that occur in the United States, the
exemption does not apply to rating actions involving the credit rating assigned to the obligor as an entity.
In contrast, if the rating action involves a security or money market instrument, the NRSRO need only
make the required conclusion with respect to the specific issuance.

See Order Granting Temporary Conditional Exemption for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating

No. 70919 (Nov. 22, 2013) (most recent extension of the exemption). In the original order, the
Commission provided guidance on how an NRSRO may have a “reasonable basis” for the purpose of the
second prong of the conditional exemption. See Order Granting Temporary Conditional Exemption for
Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations from Requirements of Rule 17g-5 Under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Request for Comment, Exchange Act Release No. 62120 (May 19,
2010) (“The question of whether an NRSRO has a ‘reasonable basis’ to conclude that the structured finance
product will be offered and sold upon issuance, and [that] any arranger linked to the structured finance
product will effect transactions of the structured finance product after issuance, in transactions that occur
outside the United States will depend on the facts and circumstances of a given situation. In order to have a
reasonable basis to make these conclusions, the NRSRO should discuss with any arranger linked to the
structured finance product (i.e., the sponsor, underwriter, and issuer) how they intend to market and sell the
structured finance product and how they intend to engage in any secondary market activities (i.e., re-sales)
of the structured finance product. An NRSRO may choose to obtain from the arranger a representation
upon which the NRSRO can reasonably rely that sales of the structured finance product will meet this
condition. Factors relevant to the analysis of whether such reliance would be reasonable would include, but
not be limited to: (1) ongoing or prior failures by the arranger to adhere to its representations; or (2) a
pattern of conduct by the arranger where it fails to promptly correct breaches of its representations.”).

of Rule 17g-7, to add that an NRSRO must publish the items described in paragraphs (a)(1) and
(a)(2) of Rule 17g-7 “except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)” of Rule 17g-7. 1109
The Commission is adopting the third sentence of the prefatory text of paragraph (a) of
Rule 17g-7 with technical modifications to improve its clarity. 1110 This sentence provides that
the items described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be published in the same manner as the
credit rating that is the result or subject of the rating action and made available to the same
persons who can receive or access the credit rating that is the result or subject of the rating
action. 1111 In response to comments, the Commission agrees that an NRSRO may satisfy this
requirement by publishing the form and any applicable certifications on its public Internet
website if the credit rating is disseminated through the website as well. 1112 In addition, if the
NRSRO publishes the credit rating in a press release announcing the relevant rating action in
addition to publishing the credit rating on its corporate Internet website, the NRSRO may make
the form available through a clearly and prominently labeled hyperlink on the press release to the
page on its corporate Internet website that contains the form and any applicable certifications. 1113
In addition, the final amendments, as proposed, require that the form and any applicable
certifications on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E must be made available to the same persons who

302

can receive or access the credit rating that is the result of the rating action. 1114 Consequently, if
the NRSRO publishes credit ratings for free on its corporate Internet website, it must make the
form and certifications similarly available. 1115 Alternatively, if the NRSRO operates under the
subscriber-pay business model, it must make the form and certifications available to its
subscribers. 1116
Finally, one commenter suggested the assessment of financial penalties for each day that
NRSROs do not post the form when taking a rating action. 1117 The Commission has authority to
take appropriate action against an NRSRO that fails to comply with the requirements of
paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7. Further, as discussed above in section II.D.1. of this release, the
Exchange Act provides a wide range of fines, penalties, and other sanctions applicable to
NRSROs for violations of any section of the Exchange Act (including section 15E) and the rules
under the Exchange Act (including the rules under section 15E). 1118 The Commission therefore
does not believe that providing for additional penalties is necessary.

Paragraph (a)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-7 – Format of the Form

To implement sections 15E(s)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, the Commission
proposed paragraph (a)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-7, which would describe the required format of the
form to accompany the publication of a rating action. 1119 In particular, section 15E(s)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act provides that the form developed by the NRSRO shall be easy to use and

helpful for users of credit ratings to understand the information contained in the report. 1120 The
Commission proposed paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of Rule 17g-7 to implement this section of the
statute. 1121 This paragraph – as proposed – mirrored the statutory text by providing that the form
generated by the NRSRO would need to be easy to use and helpful for users of credit ratings to
understand the information contained in the form. 1122
Section 15E(s)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act provides that the quantitative content required
to be disclosed in the form and identified in section 15E(s)(3)(B) must be directly comparable
across types of securities. 1123 As discussed below, section 15E(s)(3) of the Exchange Act
identifies qualitative and quantitative information that must be included in the form. 1124 The
Commission proposed that the quantitative content specified in section 15E(s)(3)(B) of the
Exchange Act must be disclosed in the form pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(K), (L), and (M) of
Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1125 Consequently, paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed,
required the form generated by the NRSRO to be in a format that provides the content described
in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(K), (L), and (M) of Rule 17g-7 in a manner that is directly comparable
across types of obligors, securities, and money market instruments. 1126

1126

See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33540. While the statutory text refers only to “securities,” section 3(a)(60) of the
Exchange Act defines the term credit rating to mean an “assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor as
an entity or with respect to specific securities or money market instruments.” See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(60).
Consequently, proposed paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of Rule 17g-7 also referred to “obligors” and “money
market instruments” to ensure that it applies to all types of credit ratings and to be consistent with the
Commission’s rules for NRSROs, which commonly apply to credit ratings of “obligors, securities, and

The Commission is adopting the proposal with modifications in response to
comments. 1127 The modifications are designed to respond to comments recommending that the
rule prescribe a standard format for presenting the information in the form. 1128
In particular, as proposed, the rule would require that the form, among other things, must
be in a format that is easy to use and helpful for users of credit ratings to understand. 1129
However, the proposal did not prescribe a form into which NRSROs would input information or
provide more specificity as to how the information in the form must be presented. Two
commenters recommended that the format of the form should be more standardized. 1130 One
commenter stated that standardization would simplify oversight and make the information in the
form easier for investors to analyze. 1131 The other commenter suggested standard headings and
prescribing an order for the presentation of the information in the form. 1132 The Commission
agrees with the commenters that requiring the NRSROs to adhere to a more standardized format
will assist users of the form in locating and analyzing items of information disclosed in the form.
It also will facilitate the Commission’s oversight of the disclosure requirements, as noted by the
commenter. Consequently, paragraph (a)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-7 provides that the form must be in a
format that organizes the information required to be disclosed into numbered items that are
identified by the type of information being disclosed and by a reference to the paragraph in Rule
17g-7 that specifies the information required to be disclosed, and are in the order that the

paragraphs specifying the information to be disclosed are codified in Rule 17g-7. 1133 In addition,
as adopted, paragraph (a)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-7 contains a note providing details about this
requirement—in particular, stating that a given item in the form should be identified by a title
that identifies the type of information and references paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E),
(F), (G), (H), (I), (J), (K), (L), (M), (N), or (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7, based on the information being
disclosed in the item. 1134 The note provides the example that the item on the form containing the
information specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of Rule 17g-7 should be captioned: “Main
Assumptions and Principles Used to Construct the Rating Methodology used to Determine the
Credit Rating as required by Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of Rule 17g-7.” 1135 The note also explains
that the form must organize the items of information in the following order: items 1 through 14
must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (N) of Rule 17g-7,
respectively, and item 15 must contain the certifications specified in paragraph (a)(2) of Rule
17g-7. 1136
Several NRSROs stated that a standardized form may discourage NRSROs from
providing more transparency. 1137 Another NRSRO stated that if formatted disclosure is
ultimately required, “the Commission should provide sufficient flexibility to allow for disclosure

1133

See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of Rule 17g-7, and the accompanying note to the paragraph. This approach,
specifying the order in which the information must be presented, is consistent with the amendments to the
instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO being adopted today, which specify the order in which the
Transition/Default Matrices must presented in the Exhibit. See paragraph (2) of the instructions for Exhibit
1 to Form NRSRO. See also section II.E.1.c. of this release discussing the amendments to the instructions
for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO.

that is meaningful in the context provided.” 1138 The Commission believes the approach it has
taken in prescribing a standardized format for presenting the information in the form without, for
example, requiring that a prescribed form be filled out, strikes an appropriate balance in
implementing section 15E(s)(2) of the Exchange Act between the comparability of the
information provided across NRSROs and the flexibility to allow for meaningful disclosure. For
example, the final amendments – while prescribing certain formatting requirements – generally
permit an NRSRO to design the form that will be used to make the disclosure. Thus, an NRSRO
can tailor the form to specific classes or subclasses of credit ratings to provide more targeted
information.
The proposed amendments required that the form must be in a format that is easy to use
and helpful for users of credit ratings to understand the information contained in the form. 1139
The proposed rule text closely mirrored section 15E(s)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. 1140 The
modifications discussed above prescribing a standard for presenting the information in the form
are specifically designed to achieve the objective set forth in section 15E(s)(2)(A) and the
proposed rule. However, the final amendments, as proposed, include the more general
requirement that the form must be in a format that is “easy to use and helpful for users of credit
ratings to understand the information contained in the form.” 1141 Because the presentation of the
information has been prescribed, this format-related requirement will be more relevant to the
narrative disclosures that are made in the items of the form. In particular, NRSROs must provide
narrative disclosures that help users of credit ratings to understand the information. Several

commenters stated that the form will result in boilerplate disclosure rather than more
transparency. 1142 Pursuant to the final amendments, NRSROs will need to make the disclosures
as specific to the particular rating action, and as relevant to investors, as possible, and strike a
reasonable balance between standardizing the disclosures and tailoring them to specific rating
actions. While the Commission recognizes that some of the information to be disclosed in the
form may be standardized for classes or subclasses of credit ratings, NRSROs must disclose
information in the form in a manner that promotes greater understanding of how a credit rating
was determined. Accordingly, the form must contain plainly worded and succinct disclosures
that are easy to understand and not lengthy boilerplate disclaimers.
Finally, paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, provides that the form must be
in a format that provides the content described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(K), (L), and (M) of Rule
17g-7 in a manner that is directly comparable across types of obligors, securities, and money
market instruments. 1143 As discussed below in section II.G.3. of this release, these paragraphs of
Rule 17g-7 require the disclosure of certain types of quantitative information as mandated by
section 15E(s)(3)(B) of the Exchange Act. 1144 One commenter stated that it would be difficult, if
not impossible, to make this information “directly comparable” across all NRSROs. 1145 In
response, the Commission notes that the final amendments require certain types of quantitative
information to be comparable across types of obligors, securities, and money market instruments
rated by the NRSRO (rather than across NRSROs). 1146

Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 17g-7 – Content of the Form

Section 15E(s)(3) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall require, by
rule, that the form accompanying the publication of a credit rating contain specifically identified
items of information. 1147 In particular, section 15E(s)(3)(A) identifies eight items of “qualitative
content” 1148 and section 15E(s)(3)(B) identifies four items of “quantitative content.” 1149 Because
the statute specified the type of information to be included in the form, the Commission proposed
rule text prescribing the required contents of the form that largely mirrored the statutory text. 1150
In particular, the prefatory text of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, provided that
the form generated by the NRSRO must contain the information about the credit rating that is
identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (N) of the rule. 1151 The order of, and information
required in, these paragraphs largely mirrored the provisions of section 15E(s)(3) of the
Exchange Act. 1152
The Commission is adopting the prefatory text of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 17g-7
without modification. 1153 The paragraph provides that the form generated by the NRSRO must

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 17g-7. One NRSRO suggested that the prefatory text be modified to add
the phrase “to the extent applicable”. See Moody’s Letter. The Commission is not making this
modification because the specific disclosure provisions contain such limiters when the information to be
disclosed may not be applicable in all cases. See, e.g., paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(D), (G), (J), (L), (M), (N) of
Rule 17g-7.

309

contain information about the credit rating identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (N). 1154
Consequently, NRSROs are required to generate a form containing the prescribed information
and publish it when taking a rating action (as defined in the prefatory text of paragraph (a) of
Rule 17g-7).
Several commenters raised concerns that the proposed rule could require the disclosure of
confidential or proprietary information regarding the NRSRO or an issuer. 1155 The Commission
does not intend that the rule require an NRSRO to disclose confidential or proprietary
information in the form. As discussed above, the format of the form must be easy to use and
helpful for users of credit ratings to understand the information contained in the form about the
rating action. 1156 NRSROs must provide narrative disclosures that are helpful for users of credit
ratings to understand the information and, therefore, the form must contain plainly worded and
succinct disclosures that are not overly detailed. An NRSRO must meet this standard through
disclosures that are informative but at the same time the Commission does not expect an NRSRO
to disclose confidential or proprietary information.
As noted above, commenters suggested expanding the information required to be
disclosed in the form. In particular, one commenter stated that the Commission should
encourage NRSROs to provide additional information if they deem it appropriate, 1157 another
stated that NRSROs should provide further information that would enable investors to
understand the significance of the disclosures, 1158 and a third stated that NRSROs should be
required to indicate the “projected time period during which the given rating was expected to be

valid.” 1159 One commenter stated that some disclosure requirements should be expanded to
provide in greater detail information that can be used by investors and other users of credit
ratings. 1160 Another commenter suggested further rulemaking to require NRSROs to disclose
and explain the rationale behind proposed credit ratings to the rated entity prior to publication,
provide a rated entity with the right to appeal a proposed credit rating, and give reasonable
consideration to an appeal. 1161
In contrast, other commenters raised burden concerns with respect to the breadth of the
information that the proposed rule required to be included in the form. One NRSRO urged the
Commission not to extend the rule beyond what the statute requires. 1162 Another NRSRO stated
that although the form may be useful to investors, it must not be “so lengthy and overburdened
with detail that it loses its utility,” and expressed a concern that the level of detail “far surpasses
what most users of credit ratings would find of practical use, while imposing unnecessary
burdens on NRSROs.” 1163 A third NRSRO stated that disclosure should be limited to assetbacked securities ratings, indicating that expanding requirements to other ratings is “extremely
overburdensome” and provides little information that is not already publicly available. 1164
The Commission acknowledges that section 15E(s)(3) of the Exchange Act identifies a
significant amount of information that the Commission’s rule must require to be disclosed in the
form. 1165 This information will be helpful in providing transparency as to how an NRSRO
determines credit ratings across all classes of credit ratings. This transparency should benefit

users of credit ratings and could mitigate the risk of undue reliance on credit ratings by providing
information about the limits of credit ratings. Further, because the statute was very specific
regarding the information to be disclosed, the Commission has sought to model its rule closely
on the statutory text. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe it would be appropriate to
limit the disclosure requirements to rating actions involving asset-backed securities. Moreover,
given the significant amount of information required to be disclosed, the Commission also does
not believe it to be necessary at this time to expand the disclosure requirements as suggested by
some commenters.
The Commission also wants to emphasize that the information that must be disclosed in
the form must relate to the rating action that is being taken. The NRSRO need not include in the
disclosure information about the credit rating that is no longer up-to-date. For example,
consistent with the statutory text, the rule text sometimes uses the phrase “to determine the credit
rating.” The Commission intended this to relate to the credit rating that is determined as a
consequence of the rating action that triggers the disclosure requirement (a preliminary credit
rating, an initial credit rating, an upgrade or downgrade of the credit rating, or certain
affirmations or withdrawals of the credit rating). The objective is to provide investors and other
users of credit ratings with helpful information about the rating action being taken with respect to
the credit rating of the obligor, security, or money market instrument.
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A). Section 15E(s)(3)(A)(i) of the Exchange Act provides that, as
required by Commission rule, an NRSRO shall disclose on the form the credit ratings produced
by the NRSRO. 1166 The Commission proposed to implement this section in paragraph

1166

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s)(3)(A)(i).

312

(a)(1)(ii)(A) of Rule 17g-7. 1167 This paragraph, as proposed, would require the NRSRO to
include in the form the symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO to
denote the credit rating categories and notches within categories assigned to the obligor, security,
or money market instrument that is the subject of the credit rating and the identity of the obligor,
security, or money market instrument. 1168
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of Rule 17g-7 with one modification
from the proposal. 1169 The paragraph provides that the form must contain the symbol, number,
or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO to denote credit rating categories and notches
within categories assigned to the obligor, security, or money market instrument that is the subject
of the credit rating and, as applicable, the identity of the obligor or the identity of the security or
money market instrument and, in a modification from the proposal, must also contain, a
description of the security or money market instrument. 1170
The Commission stated in the proposing release that the identity of a security or money
market instrument must be the name of the security or money market instrument, if applicable,
and a description of the security or money market instrument. 1171 In the proposing release, the
Commission provided an example of how an NRSRO could identify a bond: “senior unsecured
debt issued by Company XYZ maturing in 2015.” 1172 Consistent with the discussion in the
proposing release, the Commission has modified the rule text from the proposal to add that, in

the case of a credit rating of a security or money market instrument, the NRSRO must include in
the form “the identity and a description of the security or money market instrument.” 1173
Two NRSROs commented on the requirement to identify the relevant obligor. 1174 In the
proposing release, the Commission stated its preliminary belief that the obligor’s identity would
be its legal name and any other name used in its business. 1175 One NRSRO stated that it could be
“enormously burdensome” for an NRSRO to learn and disclose all the business names that an
obligor may use, and the additional information would add “little benefit” to those who use the
form.” 1176 The other NRSRO stated that entry of legal names in its database has been
problematic due to the inconsistent use of abbreviations. 1177 Both NRSROs suggested that
NRSROs should be permitted to determine the clearest way to identify obligors. 1178 The
Commission agrees with the commenters that an NRSRO should be permitted to determine the
clearest way to identify an obligor. An NRSRO must disclose a name that clearly identifies the
obligor. 1179
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B). Section 15E(r)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall prescribe rules with respect to the procedures and methodologies used by
NRSROs that require NRSROs to notify users of credit ratings of the version of a procedure or
methodology, including the qualitative methodology or quantitative inputs, used with respect to a

proposed to implement this provision in Rules 17g-8 and 17g-7. 1181 With respect to Rule 17g-7,
proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) would require an NRSRO to disclose on the form the version of
the procedure or methodology used to determine the credit rating. 1182
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of Rule 17g-7 as proposed. 1183 The
paragraph provides that the NRSRO must include in the form the version of the procedure or
methodology used to determine the credit rating. 1184
Two NRSROs commented on paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1185
One NRSRO stated that disclosing the version of the procedure or methodology used to
determine a credit rating could be accomplished by identifying the name of the procedure or
methodology, the date the procedure was implemented, and a hyperlink to further information
about the procedure or methodology. 1186 The Commission agrees. 1187
A second NRSRO stated that the actual benefit to investors is slight because the required
content can be accessed through the NRSRO’s public Internet website. 1188 As the Commission

stated in the proposing release, section 15E(s)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall require, by rule, each NRSRO to prescribe a form to accompany the
publication of a credit rating that discloses information that can be used by investors and other
users of credit ratings to better understand credit ratings in each class of credit rating issued by
the NRSRO. 1189 Disclosing in the form the version of the procedure or methodology used to
determine the credit rating will promote this goal. For example, credit rating methodologies that
are predominantly quantitative may rely on models to produce credit ratings. These models are
periodically updated and released as newer or different versions of the previous model.

rating is expected to help investors and other users of credit ratings better understand the credit
rating and how the determination of the credit rating may differ from the determination of credit
ratings of similar products using an earlier version of the model.
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C). Section 15E(s)(3)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act provides that, as
required by Commission rule, an NRSRO shall disclose on the form the main assumptions and
principles used in constructing procedures and methodologies, including qualitative
methodologies and quantitative inputs and assumptions about the correlation of defaults across
underlying assets used in rating structured products. 1190 The Commission proposed to
implement this section through paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of Rule 17g-7, which mirrored the
statutory text. 1191 The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of Rule 17g-7 as

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33460, 33540. This paragraph, as proposed, would require the NRSRO to include
in the form the main assumptions and principles used in constructing the procedures and methodologies
used to determine the credit rating, including qualitative methodologies and quantitative inputs, and, if the
credit rating is for a structured finance product, assumptions about the correlation of defaults across the
underlying assets.

assumptions and principles used in constructing the procedures and methodologies used to
determine the credit rating, including qualitative methodologies and quantitative inputs, and, if
the credit rating is for a structured finance product, assumptions about the correlation of defaults
across the underlying assets. 1193
Three commenters addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1194 One
NRSRO stated that the Commission should harmonize this requirement with those of similar
disclosures required in other jurisdictions, including the European Union. 1195 The commenter,
however, did not provide explicit suggestions as to how the rule text could be modified to
provide for such harmonization. Consequently, the Commission is not modifying the text on this
basis. Two commenters stated that the Commission should not require the disclosure of
confidential or proprietary information belonging to either the NRSRO or the issuer, such as
non-public financial information of an issuer. 1196 The Commission does not intend that NRSROs
will be required to disclose confidential or proprietary information to meet the requirements of
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of Rule 17g-7. As discussed earlier with respect to the format of the
form, NRSROs must provide narrative disclosures that are helpful for users of credit ratings to
understand the information. Accordingly, the form must contain plainly worded and succinct
disclosures. However, the Commission does not expect the disclosures to include confidential or
proprietary information.

Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D). Section 15E(s)(3)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act provides that, as
required by Commission rule, an NRSRO shall disclose on the form the potential limitations of
the credit ratings and the types of risks excluded from the credit ratings that the NRSRO does not
comment on, including liquidity, market, and other risks. 1197 The Commission proposed to
implement this section through paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of Rule 17g-7, which mirrored the
statutory text. 1198
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of Rule 17g-7 as proposed. 1199 The
paragraph provides that the NRSRO must include in the form the potential limitations of the
credit rating, including the types of risks excluded from the credit rating that the NRSRO does
not comment on, including, as applicable, liquidity, market, and other risks. 1200
Two commenters addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1201 One
NRSRO supported the rule text as proposed, 1202 and another commenter stated that the disclosure
should include more than a listing of the risks that are not assessed as part of the rating. 1203 The
Commission agrees with both commenters and notes that the rule as proposed and adopted
requires the NRSRO to disclose the potential limitations of the credit rating, including the types
of risks excluded from the credit rating that the NRSRO does not comment on, including, as
applicable, liquidity, market, and other risks. Consequently, the risks excluded from the credit

limitations of the credit rating with respect to the risks the NRSRO does comment on, including
credit risk.
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(E). Section 15E(s)(3)(A)(iv) of the Exchange provides that, as
required by Commission rule, an NRSRO shall disclose on the form information on the
uncertainty of the credit rating, including: (1) information on the reliability, accuracy, and quality
of the data relied on in determining the credit rating; and (2) a statement relating to the extent to
which data essential to the determination of the credit rating were reliable or limited, including
any limits on the scope of historical data and any limits in accessibility to certain documents or
other types of information that would have better informed the credit rating. 1204 The
Commission proposed to implement this section through paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(E) of Rule 17g-7,
which mirrored the statutory text. 1205
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(E) of Rule 17g-7 as proposed. 1206 The
paragraph provides that the form must contain information on the uncertainty of the credit rating,
including: (1) information on the reliability, accuracy, and quality of the data relied on in

Two commenters addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(E) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1208 One
commenter stated that the Commission should require an NRSRO to address specifically the
heightened uncertainty associated with ratings of offerings that do not have an extensive track
record, complex or customized securities, or areas where the credit rating agency has limited data
on which to base a rating. 1209 The Commission agrees and believes the rule as proposed and
adopted requires disclosure on the matters identified by the commenter in that it requires
disclosures regarding limits on the scope of historical data and limits on the accessibility to
certain documents or other types of information that would have better informed the credit
rating.
One NRSRO stated that requiring NRSROs to provide overly detailed information
regarding “‘reliability,’ ‘accuracy’ and ‘quality’” of data, could result in extremely lengthy
disclosures due to the number of types of data. 1210 The NRSRO further stated that the
Commission should harmonize this requirement with other jurisdictions’ requirements by
requiring only a statement about “(i) whether essential data was available; (ii) whether such data
was believed to be reliable; and (iii) any limitations on access to data for that transaction that
differed from typical circumstances.” 1211 As discussed above, NRSROs must provide narrative
disclosures that are helpful for users of credit ratings to understand the information and,
therefore, the form must contain plainly worded and succinct disclosures that are not
unnecessarily detailed. As for the suggestion to harmonize the rule with other jurisdictions’
requirements, the text suggested by the commenter generally seems consistent with the proposed

rule. Consequently, the Commission is not persuaded that it is necessary to modify the proposed
rule in response to this comment. 1212
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F). Section 15E(s)(3)(A)(v) of the Exchange Act provides that, as
required by Commission rule, an NRSRO shall disclose on the form whether and to what extent
third-party due diligence services have been used by the NRSRO, a description of the
information that such third party reviewed in conducting due diligence services, and a
description of the findings or conclusions of such third party. 1213 The Commission proposed to
implement this section through paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F), which largely mirrored the statutory
text. 1214
Several commenters addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1215
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications in
response to comments. 1216
Two commenters stated that the rule should be confined in scope to credit ratings on
asset-backed securities. 1217 Two NRSROs stated that unless the person providing third-party due
diligence services was engaged by the NRSRO, disclosure would be more appropriately made by
the party that hired the due diligence provider. 1218 One NRSRO stated that “[i]ssuers and

include in the form whether and to what extent third-party due diligence services were used by the
nationally recognized statistical rating organization, a description of the information that such third party
reviewed in conducting due diligence services, and a description of the findings or conclusions of such
third party.

underwriters, not NRSROs, should pass through the third party’s description of the information
reviewed and the third party’s findings and conclusions,” but, if the NRSROs must disclose the
information, the Commission should clarify that the disclosure requirement can be met by the
NRSRO “passing through the certification that the third party provides to the NRSRO.” 1219 In
addition, one commenter stated that the final amendments should require that NRSROs
“expressly restate” specific findings and conclusions from third-party due diligence reports to
prevent them from being “mischaracterized or taken out of context.” 1220 Another commenter
suggested that the words “a description of the findings or conclusions” should be revised to “a
summary of the findings and conclusions,” because a “summary” better aligns with the
requirement in proposed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 1221 The commenter further stated that
what should be provided is a summary of the findings and conclusions, not the findings and
conclusions themselves, and “there is no reason why the summary would not be substantially
similar in each context.” 1222 One NRSRO stated that publishing the certification of the thirdparty due diligence provider with the form as required by paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7, as
proposed, makes its use by the NRSRO “self-evident.” 1223
The Commission is adopting the requirement that the form must contain information
relating to due diligence services performed by a third party to implement section
15E(s)(3)(A)(v) of the Exchange Act. 1224 This information will help investors and other users of
credit ratings to understand how the NRSRO determined the credit rating. In response to the

comments that paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F) should be limited to rating actions involving asset-backed
securities, the Commission interprets the text of the rule referring to “due diligence services of a
third party” as meaning the type of due diligence services that are within the scope of Rule 17g10, as adopted, and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (which apply to third-party due diligence
services only in connection with asset-backed securities). 1225 Consequently, paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(F) is limited to rating actions involving Exchange Act-ABS. 1226
In response to comments, the Commission is modifying the rule from the proposal to
permit the NRSRO to provide a cross-reference to a Form ABS Due Diligence-15E that is
published with the form to meet part of the disclosure requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F). 1227
The Commission is persuaded by commenters that if an NRSRO used due diligence services of a
third party it would be redundant, and potentially confusing, for the NRSRO to provide a
description of the information that the third party reviewed in conducting the due diligence
services and a description of the findings or conclusions of the third party if that information is in
a Form ABS Due Diligence-15E published with the form. 1228

1225

See paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17g-10 defining the term due diligence services to mean, in pertinent part, “a
review of the assets underlying an asset-backed security, as defined in section 3(a)(79) of the [Exchange]
Act…” In addition, section 15E(s)(4) of the Exchange Act is titled “Due Diligence Services for AssetBacked Securities.” See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s)(4). Moreover, section 15E(s)(4)(A) provides that “[t]he issuer
or underwriter of any asset-backed security shall make publicly available the findings and conclusions of
any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter.” See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s)(4)(A)
(emphasis added). Consequently, as proposed, paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F) – which refers to due diligence
services – was intended to address due diligence services in the context of an asset-backed security.

1226

As stated above in section I.B.1. of this release, the term Exchange Act-ABS as used throughout this
release refers to an asset-backed security as defined in section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(79).

1227

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F)(2) of Rule 17g-7.

1228

As discussed below in section II.H.3.c. of this release, Item 4 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E requires the
third party to provide a description of the due diligence performed that addresses the information that was
reviewed and Item 5 requires the third party to provide a summary of the findings and conclusions of the
review.

323

In addition, as noted above, a commenter proposed modifying the rule to replace the
phrase “a description of the findings or conclusions” to “a summary of the findings and
conclusions,” because the commenter believed that a “summary” better aligns with the
requirement in proposed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and that, in each case, the rules should
require a summary of the findings and conclusions (as opposed to the findings and conclusions
themselves). 1229 Item 5 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E requires the third party to provide a
“summary of the findings and conclusions that resulted from the due diligence services.” 1230 The
Commission agrees with the commenter and has therefore modified the proposal to replace the
words “description of the findings or conclusions of such third party” with the words “summary
of the findings and conclusions of the third party.” 1231 However, if an NRSRO chooses to
provide a summary of the findings and conclusions, the level of detail in the summary should be
comparable to the level of detail a provider of third-party due diligence services provides in
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, as the summary in the form can be a substitute for the NRSRO
providing a summary. 1232
For these reasons, the final amendments provide that the form must contain whether and
to what extent the NRSRO used due diligence services of a third party in taking the rating action,
and, if the NRSRO used such services, either: (1) a description of the information that the third
party reviewed in conducting the due diligence services and a summary of the findings and
conclusions of the third party; or (2) a cross-reference to a Form ABS Due Diligence-15E

See ASF Letter.

1230

See Item 5 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E.

1231

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F)(1) of Rule 17g-7.

1232

The Commission, however, does not believe the rule as proposed (which required “a description of the
findings or conclusions”) and the rule as adopted (which requires a “summary of the findings and
conclusions”) contain standards that differ in any significant way. Under either standard, the NRSRO need
not repeat the actual findings and conclusions but rather must provide a higher level disclosure about them.

executed by the third party that is published with the form, provided the cross-referenced Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E contains a description of the information that the third party reviewed
in conducting the due diligence services and a summary of the findings and conclusions of the
third party. 1233
The Commission is not persuaded by the comment that publishing the certification of the
third-party due diligence provider with the form as required by paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7,
as proposed, makes its use by the NRSRO “self-evident.” 1234 As discussed below in section
II.G.5. of this release, section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act requires a third party providing
due diligence services to an NRSRO, issuer, or underwriter with respect to an asset-backed
security to provide a written certification to any NRSRO that produces a credit rating to which
the due diligence services relate. 1235 Section 15E(s)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall adopt rules requiring an NRSRO that receives a certification to disclose the
certification to the public at the time at which the NRSRO produces a rating. 1236 Paragraph
(a)(2) of Rule 17g-7, as amended, implements section 15E(s)(4)(D) by requiring the NRSRO to
publish with the form any certifications it receives. However, the NRSRO’s receipt of the
certification pursuant to section 15E(s)(4)(B) and publication of the certification pursuant to
paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7, as amended, is not predicated on the NRSRO having used the
due diligence services in determining the credit rating. Consequently, the final amendments
retain the requirement for the NRSRO to include in the form whether and to what extent the
NRSRO used due diligence services of a third party in taking the rating action. 1237

conduct surveillance of the credit rating. 1238 The Commission proposed to implement this
section through paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(G) of Rule 17g-7, which mirrored the statutory text. 1239
One commenter addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(G) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, by noting
its support of the rule text as proposed. 1240 The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(E)

326

Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(H) of Rule 17g-7 with a modification in response to
comments. 1245
One NRSRO stated that the requirement may result in “effectively overloading” investors
with information and essentially “reducing rather than enhancing” the disclosure’s value. 1246
This commenter and another commenter expressed concerns that some data may be confidential
or provided to the NRSRO under terms restricting public disclosure. 1247 One commenter
suggested that the Commission clarify that the requirement for a “description of the data relied
upon” requires only a description of the general type of data and not of specific data, since
specific data can be obtained from the relevant offering documents. 1248
In response to these comments, the Commission notes, as stated above, that section
15E(s)(3)(A)(vi) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall require, by rule, that
the NRSRO disclose on the form a description of the data about any obligor, issuer, security, or
money market instrument that were relied upon for the purpose of determining the credit
rating. 1249 Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(H) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, was designed to implement the
statute. Moreover, as discussed above, the form must disclose information that can be used by
investors and other users of credit ratings to better understand credit ratings 1250 and, therefore,
the form must contain plainly worded and succinct disclosures that are not overly detailed. In
this regard, the Commission did not intend to require that the form repeat verbatim all the data
that were relied upon to determine the credit rating. Instead, it intended the form to include a

“description” to help users of the credit rating to understand the types of data the NRSRO relied
on. To make this more clear and address the commenter’s concern, the Commission has
modified the final amendments to require the NRSRO to include in the form a description of the
types of data about any obligor, issuer, security, or money market instrument that were relied
upon for the purpose of determining the credit rating. 1251
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(I). Section 15E(s)(3)(A)(vii) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall require, by rule, that the NRSRO disclose on the form a statement containing
an overall assessment of the quality of information available and considered in producing a
rating for the obligor, security, or money market instrument, in relation to the quality of
information available to the NRSRO in rating similar issuances. 1252 The Commission proposed
to implement this section through paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(I) of Rule 17g-7, which largely mirrored
the statutory text. 1253
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(I) of Rule 17g-7 as proposed. 1254 The
paragraph provides that the NRSRO must include in the form a statement containing an overall
assessment of the quality of information available and considered in determining the credit rating

1253

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(I) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33461, 33541. This paragraph, as proposed, would require the NRSRO to include
in the form a statement containing an overall assessment of the quality of information available and
considered in determining the credit rating for the obligor, security, or money market instrument, in relation
to the quality of information available to the NRSRO in rating similar obligors, securities, or money market
instruments. The statute refers to ratings of “similar issuances.” However, a credit rating of an obligor
commonly means the rating of the obligor as an entity rather than a rating of securities or money market
instruments issued by the obligor. Consequently, the rating of an obligor may not relate to an “issuance” of
a particular security or money market instrument. Therefore, paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(I) of Rule 17g-7, as
proposed, substituted the phrase “similar obligors, securities, or money market instruments” for the phrase
“similar issuances” in the statutory text.

1254

328

for the obligor, security, or money market instrument, in relation to the quality of information
available to the NRSRO in rating similar obligors, securities, or money market instruments. 1255
One NRSRO stated that the requirement to disclose an overall assessment of the quality
of information used in its rating “would present practical, and possibly contractual difficulties,”
and that the Commission should harmonize this requirement with other jurisdictions’
requirements by requiring a statement about “(i) whether essential data was available; (ii)
whether such data was believed to be reliable; and (iii) any limitations on access to data for that
transaction that differed from typical circumstances.” 1256 The commenter did not explain how
the proposed requirement would present contractual difficulties but, as discussed above, the
Commission does not intend the disclosure provisions in the rule to require NRSROs to disclose
confidential or proprietary information. In terms of practical issues, as discussed above, the
NRSROs must provide narrative disclosures in the form that are helpful for users of credit
ratings to understand the information and, therefore, the form must contain plainly worded and
succinct disclosures that are not overly detailed. Thus, the practical issue of having to make
highly detailed disclosures is not implicated by the rule as proposed and adopted. As for the
suggestion to harmonize the rule with other jurisdictions, the text suggested by the commenter
generally seems aimed at requiring relatively similar disclosures though it does not explicitly
require an assessment of the overall quality of information available to the NRSRO in rating
similar obligors, securities, or money market instruments. Consequently, the Commission is not
persuaded that it is necessary to implement the statute in a manner that deviates from the
proposed rule. 1257

Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J). Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J) of Rule 17g-7 1258 would
implement, in part, section 15E(s)(3)(A)(viii) of the Exchange Act, which provides that the
Commission shall require, by rule, that the NRSRO disclose on the form information relating to
conflicts of interest of the NRSRO. 1259 The Commission proposed to identify three specific
items of information that, at a minimum, an NRSRO would need to disclose in the form relating
to conflicts of interest. 1260
First, proposed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(1) would require the NRSRO to include a
classification of the credit rating as either solicited sell-side, solicited buy-side, or unsolicited. 1261
The proposal defined solicited sell-side to mean that the credit rating was paid for by the obligor
being rated or the issuer, underwriter, depositor, or sponsor of the security or money market
instrument being rated. 1262 The proposal defined solicited buy-side to mean that the credit rating
was paid for by a person other than the obligor being rated or the issuer, underwriter, depositor,
or sponsor of the security or money market instrument being rated. 1263 The proposal defined an
unsolicited credit rating to mean the NRSRO was not paid to determine the credit rating. 1264 The

was to include credit ratings funded by selling subscriptions to access the credit ratings (so-called
“subscriber-paid credit ratings”). See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at
33461-33462. However, if a subscriber paid the NRSRO to determine a credit rating for a specific obligor,
security, or money market instrument, the credit rating would need to be classified as either solicited sellside, if the subscriber also was the obligor, issuer, underwriter, depositor, or sponsor of the security or

330

Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(1) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications in response
to comments about these definitions. 1265
One NRSRO stated that equating the concept of solicitation with payment would result in
confusion in the market, and that the definition should be harmonized with that of other
jurisdictions, where an unsolicited credit rating is defined as one that is initiated by the credit
rating agency and not requested by the issuer. 1266 The Commission is persuaded that requiring
the NRSRO to classify the credit rating using one of these terms could be confusing given other
views as to what constitutes a solicited or unsolicited credit rating. Further, disclosing the
conflict through a classification may not be as helpful as simply having the NRSRO include a
statement in the form as to whether another person paid for the credit rating. For these reasons,
the final amendments have been modified to exclude the specific terms proposed and instead
require the NRSRO to include in the form, as applicable, a statement that the NRSRO was: (1)
paid to determine the credit rating by the obligor being rated or the issuer, underwriter, depositor,
or sponsor of the security or money market instrument being rated; (2) paid to determine the
credit rating by a person other than the obligor being rated or the issuer, underwriter, depositor,
or sponsor of the security or money market instrument being rated; or (3) not paid to determine
the credit rating. 1267

1267

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(1) of Rule 17g-7. For the purpose of these disclosures, the Commission does
not consider a subscriber to an NRSRO’s credit ratings to be a person who paid for the credit rating simply
because the subscriber paid a fee to access the credit ratings of the NRSRO. However, the NRSRO would
need to state that it was paid to determine the credit rating if, for example, the subscriber paid for the credit
rating because it was the obligor being rated or the issuer, underwriter, depositor, or sponsor of the security
or money market instrument being rated, or the subscriber paid for determination of the credit rating
because the subscriber was an investor or potential investor in the security or money market instrument and
hired the NRSRO to rate the security or money market instrument.

331

The second type of conflict disclosure was specified in proposed paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(J)(2) of Rule 17g-7. 1268 Pursuant to this paragraph, if the credit rating was classified as
either solicited sell-side or solicited buy-side, the NRSRO would be required to disclose whether
the NRSRO provided services other than determining credit ratings to the person that paid for the
credit rating during the most recently ended fiscal year. 1269 The Commission is adopting
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(J)(2) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications in response to comments. 1270
A commenter stated that the disclosure about other services provided by an NRSRO does
not provide any basis to conclude that a rating may be compromised. 1271 Another commenter
strongly opposed the requirement due to the difficulty of shielding analysts from such
information so as to promote independence in the credit rating process. 1272 A third commenter
supported the proposed requirement and added that the Commission should also require
NRSROs to disclose the revenue they received from a particular issuer. 1273
The Commission does not agree with the commenter that being paid for other services
does not present a potential conflict. As the Commission stated in the proposing release, clients
paying an NRSRO for services in addition to determining credit ratings may pose an increased
risk of exerting undue influence on the NRSRO with respect to its determination of credit
ratings. 1274 The Commission has adopted rules that address this conflict. 1275 The proposed

1274

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33461-33462. In this regard, the
Commission notes that section 939H of the Dodd-Frank Act contains a sense of Congress that the
Commission should exercise rulemaking authority under section 15E(h)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act to
prevent improper conflicts of interest arising from employees of NRSROs providing services to issuers of

332

disclosure requirement about paying for other services was intended to complement these
requirements. 1276
The Commission acknowledges the concern raised by the commenter about the objective
of shielding analysts from information that could compromise their independence. 1277
Nonetheless, the Commission believes that the proposed disclosure that the NRSRO was paid for
other services is appropriate because it will provide users of credit ratings with relevant
information about this conflict even when balanced against the concern that an analyst reading
the report will learn that the NRSRO was paid for other services. If the NRSRO was required to
disclose the amount of revenue received (as suggested by the third commenter), this concern that
the analyst might be influenced by the disclosure would be increased. 1278
For all of these reasons, the Commission is adopting the requirement that the NRSRO
must include a disclosure in the form if it was paid for other services. 1279 The Commission
modified the final amendments to correspond to the modifications discussed above with respect
to eliminating the proposed classification of the credit rating as either solicited or unsolicited.
Specifically, the final amendments require the NRSRO, if applicable, to include in the form a
statement that the NRSRO also was paid for services other than determining credit ratings during

securities that are unrelated to the issuance of credit ratings, including consulting, advisory, and other
services. See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 939H. See also 2013 Staff Report on Credit Rating Agency
Independence (a report on the potential conflict of interest that arises from a credit rating agency providing

rating. 1280
The third type of conflict disclosure was specified in (a)(1)(ii)(J)(3) and related to rating
actions resulting from look-back reviews. 1281 As discussed above in section II.C.1. of this
release, the proposal would require the disclosure of information about a conflict of interest
influencing a credit rating action discovered as a result of a look-back review conducted pursuant
to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act and proposed paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8. Also, as
discussed above in section II.C.1. of this release, the Commission is adopting paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications in response to comments that eliminate the
required disclosure that would have accompanied the placement of the credit rating on credit
watch, modify the required disclosure with respect to estimating the impact of the conflict, and
make certain related and technical modifications. 1282
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(K). Section 15E(s)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall require, by rule, that the NRSRO disclose on the form an explanation or
measure of the potential volatility of the credit rating, including: (1) any factors that might lead
to a change in the credit rating; and (2) the magnitude of the change that a user can expect under
different market conditions. 1283 The Commission proposed to implement this section through
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(K) of Rule 17g-7, which largely mirrored the statutory text. 1284 The

334

Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(K) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications in response to
comment. 1285
Three commenters addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(K) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1286 An
NRSRO suggested that the Commission modify the rule to require the disclosure of any factors
that are “reasonably likely to” (rather than “might”) lead to a change in the credit rating. 1287 A
second NRSRO stated that “each NRSRO should decide for itself what conditions merit
discussion in light of the characteristics of the rated instrument and whatever other information
the NRSRO believes it is appropriate to take into account.” 1288 A third commenter stated that the
Commission should require the NRSROs to be very specific about the events and the magnitude
of those events that would cause ratings to be in “error” and provided a five percent drop in
housing prices as an example. 1289
The Commission agrees with the modifications suggested by the first commenter. The
word “might” as used in the proposed rule text is imprecise and could lead to disclosures that
seek to identify any conceivable factor that could lead to the change in the credit rating no matter
how remote the possibility. This could diminish the usefulness of the disclosure by including
information that is not highly relevant to understanding the credit rating and generally making
the disclosure too long.
Regarding the second comment, the magnitude of the change that could occur under
different market conditions will depend on an NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies for

under different market conditions.

determining credit ratings that apply to the credit rating that is subject to the rating action. 1290
Consequently, the required disclosure – as proposed and adopted – will be based on those
procedures and methodologies and how they account for different market conditions. In other
words, the NRSRO will need to “decide for itself” the potential market conditions that could
cause a change in the credit rating given its rating procedures and methodologies. However, to
make this clear, the Commission is modifying the rule to specify that the different market
conditions are those that are determined by the NRSRO to be relevant to the rating. 1291
Finally, the Commission generally agrees with the third commenter that the disclosure by
the NRSRO must specify the factors (for example, market conditions) that would lead to a
change in the credit rating. As discussed above, the NRSRO must disclose factors that might
lead to a change in the credit rating. In doing so, the NRSRO must explain the factors.
For these reasons, the final amendments require the NRSRO to include in the form an
explanation or measure of the potential volatility of the credit rating, including: (1) any factors
that are reasonably likely to lead to a change in the credit rating; and (2) the magnitude of the
change that could occur under different market conditions determined by the NRSRO to be
relevant to the rating. 1292
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(L). Section 15E(s)(3)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall require, by rule, that the NRSRO disclose on the form information on the
content of the credit rating, including: (1) the historical performance of the credit rating; and (2)
the expected probability of default and the expected loss in the event of default. 1293 The

which mirrored the statutory text. 1294
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(L) of Rule 17g-7 as proposed. 1295 The
paragraph provides that the NRSRO must include in the form information on the content of the
credit rating, including: (1) if applicable, the historical performance of the credit rating; and (2)
the expected probability of default and the expected loss in the event of default. 1296
Two NRSROs addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(L) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1297 One
stated that it supports the disclosure elements specified in this paragraph. 1298 The other
commenter stated that the proposal is sufficiently explicit, but indicated that its credit ratings do
not connote a “particular” expectation of the probability of default. 1299 The Commission
recognizes that credit ratings generally are intended to indicate the relative degree of credit risk
of an obligor or debt instrument rather than reflect a measure of a specific default probability or
loss expectation. 1300 The Commission does not expect NRSROs to alter the meanings of their
credit ratings or rating procedures and methodologies to conform to the disclosure requirement.
Rather, the Commission expects NRSROs to provide “information” to the extent it is consistent
with their procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings, on the expected

of, for example, historical default and loss statistics, respectively, for the class or subclass of the

Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(M). Section 15E(s)(3)(B)(iii) of the Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall require, by rule, that the NRSRO disclose on the form information on the
sensitivity of the credit rating to assumptions made by the NRSRO, including: (1) five
assumptions made in the ratings process that, without accounting for any other factor, would
have the greatest impact on a rating if the assumptions were proven false or inaccurate; and (2)
an analysis, using specific examples, of how each of the five assumptions identified impacts a
credit rating. 1301 The Commission proposed to implement this section through paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(M) of Rule 17g-7, which mirrored the statutory text. 1302 The Commission is adopting
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(M) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications in response to comments. 1303
Several commenters addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(M) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1304
An NRSRO stated that the disclosure of assumptions will tend to become a “mechanical
exercise” where disclosure is “sufficiently vague so as to be unimpeachable,” but will not be
useful. 1305 Another NRSRO stated that it should be permissible to disclose fewer than five

assumptions if fewer than five significant assumptions exist. 1306 Two other NRSROs stated that
it may be difficult to identify five single assumptions 1307 because, according to one NRSRO,
many assumptions are “cross-dependent,” and different assumptions may “play out differently in
various economic scenarios.” 1308 Another commenter stated that the Commission should also
require NRSROs to disclose the sensitivity of the credit rating to several assumptions changing at
the same time and the dependencies assumed between the assumptions. 1309
The Commission agrees with the commenter that an NRSRO should not disclose five
assumptions if there are fewer than five assumptions that would have an impact on the credit
rating if proven false or inaccurate. Otherwise, the disclosure could contain information that is
potentially misleading by, for example, creating the impression the assumption is important
when it is not. Consequently, the final amendments are modified to include a provision that the
NRSRO need only disclose information on the assumptions that would have an impact on the
credit rating if there are fewer than five such assumptions. 1310 Specifically, the final
amendments require the NRSRO to include in the form information on the sensitivity of the
credit rating to assumptions made by the NRSRO, including: (1) five assumptions made in the
ratings process that, without accounting for any other factor, would have the greatest impact on
the credit rating if the assumptions were proven false or inaccurate, provided that, if the NRSRO
has made fewer than five such assumptions, it need only disclose information on the assumptions

that would have an impact on the credit rating; and (2) an analysis, using specific examples, of
how each of the assumptions impacts the credit rating. 1311
In response to the comment that this disclosure will become “mechanical” and not useful,
the Commission – as stated above – expects NRSROs to make the disclosures as specific to the
particular rating action, and as relevant to investors, as possible, and to strike a reasonable
balance between standardizing the disclosures and tailoring them to specific rating actions. With
respect to the comments on isolating the assumptions and the co-dependencies between
assumptions, the Commission understands that certain assumptions may be co-dependent. The
NRSRO should provide an explanation of this co-dependency in the disclosure of the
assumptions to the extent it is relevant to understanding how they would impact the credit rating.
Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(N). Paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(N) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, would
contain the disclosure requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-7 before today’s
amendments. 1312 Specifically, this paragraph would provide that if the credit rating is issued
with respect to an asset-backed security, as that term is defined in section 3(a)(79) of the
Exchange Act, the NRSRO must include in the form a description of: (1) the representations,
warranties, and enforcement mechanisms available to investors; and (2) how they differ from the
representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar securities, each
time there was a rating action with respect to an asset-backed security. 1313 The Commission is

340

Several commenters addressed paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(N) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed. 1315
Two NRSROs objected to the frequency of the required disclosures under the proposed
paragraph. 1316 One NRSRO stated that, while the disclosures are relevant at the time an initial
credit rating is published, the disclosures may not be relevant at later times because the
representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms likely will not change in the course of
a rated security’s existence. 1317 Another NRSRO stated that requiring the disclosures with each
rating action “unacceptably” expands the disclosure requirement in Rule 17g-7 before today’s
amendments, which required the disclosures when a rating report is published, noting that some
rating actions “would not necessarily be accompanied by the issuance of a credit rating
report.” 1318
One NRSRO stated that the disclosures required by Rule 17g-7 before today’s
amendments are “enormously costly to the NRSROs” and are “of very little value to investors”
according to feedback from institutional clients and an analysis of the NRSRO’s Internet website
usage data. 1319 This NRSRO suggested that the rule be modified to require disclosures that
“relate to the asset pool underlying the ABS transaction” and which “the issuer has disclosed in
the prospectus, private placement memorandum or other offering document for that
transaction.” 1320 Similarly, one commenter stated that the required disclosures should be limited

1320

See DBRS II Letter. In support of its suggestion, the NRSRO cited the Senate Committee on Banking,
Housing, and Urban Affairs, Committee Report No. 111-176, April 30, 2010 (“Senate Banking Committee
Report”), stating that the deficiencies in the securitization process that the applicable provision of the
Dodd-Frank Act was designed to address “included the fact that ‘investors in asset-backed securities could
not assess the risks of the underlying assets, particularly when those assets were resecuritized into complex
instruments like collateralized debt obligations.’” DBRS II Letter (quoting Senate Banking Committee

341

to representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms that “appear in the prospectus or
other offering document for [the applicable] security” because otherwise the information would
not be material to an investor’s ability to make an informed decision. 1321 Finally, an NRSRO
suggested that the benchmarks for the representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms
should be displayed in “a dedicated area of the NRSROs’ websites” instead of in the form. 1322
The Commission has modified the final amendments in response to some of these
comments and consistent with the Commission’s objective of making the information in the form
disclosed with a credit rating helpful to investors and other users of credit ratings in
understanding how the credit rating was determined. The first significant modification is to
narrow the disclosure requirement so that it addresses the representations, warranties, and
enforcement mechanisms available to investors which were disclosed in the prospectus, private
placement memorandum, or other offering documents for the asset-backed security and that
relate to the asset pool underlying the asset-backed security. The Commission agrees with
commenters that this is highly relevant information for investors. Therefore, focusing the
disclosure requirement in this way may make the required disclosure more relevant and useful to
investors and other users of credit ratings than the disclosures required under Rule 17g-7 before
today’s amendments. Specifically, paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(N) of Rule 17g-7 requires an NRSRO, if
the credit rating is assigned to an asset-backed security as defined in section 3(a)(79) of the
Exchange Act, to disclose in the form information on: (1) the representations, warranties, and
enforcement mechanisms available to investors which were disclosed in the prospectus, private
placement memorandum, or other offering documents for the asset-backed security and that

342

relate to the asset pool underlying the asset-backed security; and (2) how they differ from the
representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar securities. 1323
The second significant modification is to reduce the frequency of the disclosure. As
commenters stated, the proposal – by incorporating the requirements of Rule 17g-7 before
today’s amendments into the new form disclosure requirements – would increase the number of
times an NRSRO would need to disclose the information about representations, warranties, and
enforcement mechanisms. The Commission believes that the critical time for disclosing this
information is when investors are making investment decisions about a new issuance, which
would have no performance history. The Commission also believes the disclosure would be
useful if there is a material change in the representations, warranties, or enforcement
mechanisms after issuance because the change could be relevant to investment decisions made in
the secondary market for the security. Finally, because Rule 17g-7 became effective on
September 26, 2011, the final amendments provide that the requirement to make the disclosure
after a material change is triggered only if the rating action involves an asset-backed security that
was initially rated by the NRSRO on or after September 26, 2011. This will further limit the
burden associated with the rule. It also will address the practical issue of an NRSRO having to
make a disclosure involving historical information that it may not have collected and retained
because it was not required to make the disclosure about the representations, warranties, or

1323

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(N)(1) of Rule 17g-7. As noted above, one NRSRO suggested that the benchmarks
for the representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms should be displayed in “a dedicated area
of the NRSROs’ websites” instead of in the form. See DBRS II Letter. In response, the Commission notes
that the final amendments require the NRSRO disclose in the form information on the representations,
warranties, and enforcement mechanisms available to investors which were disclosed in the prospectus,
private placement memorandum, or other offering documents for the asset-backed security and that relate
to the asset pool underlying the asset-backed security, and how they differ from the representations,
warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar securities. The Commission does not
intend the rule to preclude including an Internet address where the benchmarks can be found on the
NRSRO’s website, provided the disclosure in the form meets the requirement in the rule. Moreover, to the
extent the benchmarks are lengthy, this approach could make the form easier to use.

enforcement mechanisms when it initially rated the asset-backed security. For these reasons, the
final amendments require the information to be disclosed if the rating action is a preliminary
credit rating or an initial credit rating or if the rating action is the first one taken after a material
change in the representations, warranties, or enforcement mechanisms and the rating action
involves an asset-backed security that was initially rated by the NRSRO on or after September
26, 2011. 1324

Paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7 – Attestation

Section 15E(q)(2)(F) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission’s rules must
require an NRSRO to include an attestation with any credit rating it issues affirming that no part
of the rating was influenced by any other business activities, that the rating was based solely on
the merits of the instruments being rated, and that such rating was an independent evaluation of
the risks and merits of the instrument. 1325 While section 15E(q) relates to the disclosure of
information about the performance of credit ratings, the Commission proposed that this
attestation provision would more appropriately be implemented with respect to all disclosures
that must be made when a specific rating action is published. 1326 Accordingly, the Commission
proposed that the attestation be included in the form accompanying a credit rating. 1327
As proposed, an NRSRO would be required to attach to the form with each rating action
a signed statement by a person within the NRSRO stating that the person has responsibility for
the credit rating and, to the best knowledge of the person: (1) no part of the credit rating was
influenced by any other business activities; (2) the credit rating was based solely upon the merits

of the obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated; and (3) the credit rating was an
independent evaluation of the risks and merits of the obligor, security, or money market
instrument. 1328 Thus, the proposed rule text mirrored the statutory text in terms of the
representations that would be included in the attestation. 1329
The Commission received several comments that addressed the proposal. 1330 One
commenter stated that the “strong” attestation requirement is a “valuable enhancement” because
it promotes increased accountability and “more meaningful disclosures.” 1331 One NRSRO
endorsed the attestation requirement substantially as proposed. 1332 Two NRSROs were
concerned that the attestation requirement would result in an employee or officer being
personally liable for a rating action. 1333 One NRSRO stated that a ratings committee already
attests to the rating’s independence by signing its internal rating forms and stated “[t]hus, such an
attestation is already part and parcel of the ratings package that is…available to Commission
staff during their annual exams, or at any other time.” 1334 One NRSRO suggested that rather
than an attestation, the NRSRO should be required to disclose the name of the chair of the rating

See DBRS Letter.

1333

See A.M. Best Letter; Morningstar Letter. While the Commission understands the commenters’ concerns
about potential liability, the Commission believes the attestation requirement is an important provision that
will promote analytic independence. The Commission does not believe it would be necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, or consistent with the protection of investors, to refrain from
implementing section 15E(q)(2)(F) of the Exchange Act, which, as discussed above, requires rulemaking
establishing an attestation requirement. See 15 U.S.C. 78mm. Further, the Commission notes that,
consistent with all other provisions of the Exchange Act and rules that impose an obligation on an entity,
there is a potential for secondary liability for an individual that aids and abets, or causes, a violation.

committee because doing so is an implicit attestation that the credit rating was determined in
accordance with the NRSRO’s rating procedures and methodologies. 1335
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7 with one modification in
response to comments. Specifically, one NRSRO suggested that the wording of the proposed
attestation – because it used the phrase “risks and merits” – could inadvertently lead users of
credit ratings to believe that credit ratings address other types of risk, such as liquidity risk,
market value risk, or price volatility. 1336 The commenter suggested the phrase “credit risk” be
used instead.
The Commission agrees. Credit ratings are assessments of creditworthiness. 1337
Consequently, the attestation should reference credit risk so as not to be misleading. In addition,
the NRSRO should have the flexibility to designate the individual who will execute the
certification, as more than one individual within the NRSRO may have responsibility for the
rating action. 1338 For these reasons, the final amendments provide that the NRSRO must attach
to the form a signed statement by a person within the NRSRO stating that the person has
responsibility for the rating action and, to the best knowledge of the person: (1) no part of the
credit rating was influenced by any other business activities; (2) the credit rating was based
solely upon the merits of the obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated; and (3)
the credit rating was an independent evaluation of the credit risk of the obligor, security, or
money market instrument. 1339
1335

See S&P Letter.

1336

See Moody’s Letter.

1337

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(60) (defining a credit rating to mean “an assessment of the creditworthiness of an
obligor as an entity or with respect to specific securities or money market instruments”).

1338

For example, if the rating action was determined through a rating committee, each of the individuals on the
committee could be designated by the NRSRO as having responsibility for the rating action.

1339

See paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7 (emphasis added to highlight the modification).

346

The Commission does not believe the alternatives suggested by commenters – relying on
internal records or disclosure of the identity of the rating committee chair – would adequately
implement the statute. As discussed above, section 15E(q)(2)(F) of the Exchange Act provides
that the Commission’s rules must require an NRSRO to include an attestation with any credit
rating it issues affirming that no part of the rating was influenced by any other business
activities, that the rating was based solely on the merits of the instruments being rated, and that
such rating was an independent evaluation of the risks and merits of the instrument. 1340
Consequently, the attestation must be included with the credit rating the NRSRO issues rather
than being documented in an internal record. Further, the Commission believes that having an
individual attest to the information disclosed in the form will promote analytical independence.
In particular, the individual executing the attestation will want to ensure that it contains no untrue
or inaccurate statements. Consequently, the individual will have an incentive to take steps to
verify that the credit rating was not influenced by any other business activities, was based solely
on the merits of the instruments being rated, and was an independent evaluation of the risks and
merits of the instrument. Moreover, if the individual does not believe such an attestation can be
truthfully made, the individual will have a reason to refuse to make the attestation. This could
prevent the NRSRO from taking a rating action that, for example, was inappropriately influenced
by conflicts of interest arising from business considerations.
The Commission is not persuaded that disclosing the name of the rating chair would
provide an implicit attestation that that no part of the credit rating was influenced by any other
business activities, that the rating was based solely on the merits of the instruments being rated,
and that such rating was an independent evaluation of the risks and merits of the instrument.

1340

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(q)(2)(F).

347

Moreover, as discussed above, having an individual execute the attestation will promote
analytical independence. Accordingly, the final amendments (as was proposed) require that the
form include an attestation executed by an individual responsible for the rating action.
Finally, one NRSRO stated that every NRSRO should be able to determine who within
the NRSRO should be responsible for making the proposed attestation. 1341 The Commission
agrees with the commenter that the NRSRO has flexibility to select the appropriate person within
the NRSRO to execute the attestation, provided the person has responsibility for the credit rating.
For example, the analyst or another member of the rating committee could execute the
attestation.

Paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7 – Third-Party Due Diligence
Certification

As discussed in more detail below in section II.H. of this release, section 15E(s)(4)(B) of
the Exchange Act requires a third party providing due diligence services to an NRSRO, issuer, or
underwriter with respect to an Exchange Act-ABS to provide a written certification to any
NRSRO that produces a credit rating to which the due diligence services relate. 1342 Section
15E(s)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall adopt a rule requiring an
NRSRO that receives a certification from a provider of third-party due diligence services to
disclose the certification to the public in a manner that allows the public to determine the
adequacy and level of the due diligence services provided by the third party. 1343 The
Commission proposed to implement section 15E(s)(4)(D) through paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-

1341

See DBRS Letter.

1342

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s)(4)(B). As stated above in section I.B.1. of this release, the term Exchange Act-ABS as used

7, as proposed. 1344 As proposed, paragraph (a)(2) identified the second item of information an
NRSRO would need to publish with a credit rating when taking a rating action: any written
certification related to the credit rating received from a third-party provider of due diligence
services pursuant to section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act. 1345 The proposed approach was
intended to provide disclosure of the certification to the public in a manner that allows the public
to determine the adequacy and level of the due diligence services provided. 1346
The Commission received a number of comment letters regarding proposed paragraph
(a)(2) of Rule 17g-7. 1347 An NRSRO stated that requiring the NRSRO to deliver “information
and commentary generated by other market participants” may lead to confusion about “the
appropriate role of NRSROs,” 1348 and another NRSRO stated that the proposed requirements
may cause NRSROs to “include in their rating disclosure form information that they believe is
not from a reliable source and that they did not use in their rating analysis.” 1349 The second
NRSRO also stated that “NRSROs do not typically engage third-party due diligence providers”
and “obtaining and disclosing this certification should be the obligation of the issuer.” 1350 On the
other hand, two commenters expressed their support for requiring NRSROs to disclose
information related to third-party due diligence reviews. 1351 Another commenter stated that only
the NRSRO is in a position to know which reports it used in issuing a credit rating. 1352 A fourth

commenter stated that the due diligence providers have a “limited role” in the transaction and
that “the onus for making the certification publicly available should rest solely with the
NRSRO.” 1353
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7 with modifications designed
to address comments made in the context of proposed Rule 17g-10. 1354 Specifically, the final
amendments are modified to explicitly reference Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 1355 In addition,
the final amendments are modified to correspond to modifications to Rule 17g-10 (discussed
below) to provide that an NRSRO must publish with a rating action any executed Form ABS
Due Diligence-15E containing information about the security or money market instrument
subject to the rating action that is received by the NRSRO or obtained by the NRSRO through an
Internet website maintained by the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the security or money
market instrument pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17g-5. As discussed below in section
II.H.2.c. of this release, the Commission is modifying Rule 17g-10 from the proposal to provide
that a person employed to provide third-party due diligence services can meet its statutory
obligation to provide the written certification relating to those services to any NRSRO that
produces a credit rating to which such services relate by promptly responding to a written request
from an NRSRO for the executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and promptly delivering the
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the security or money
market instrument that maintains the relevant Internet website pursuant to Rule 17g-5. 1356
Further, the Commission is amending Rule 17g-5 to provide for the issuer, sponsor, or

See Clayton Letter.

See paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7. See also section II.H.2. of this release (discussing the “safe harbor”

underwriter to represent that it will promptly post the Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to the
Internet website it maintains under paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17g-5. 1357
As discussed above, two NRSROs raised concerns about requiring the NRSRO to
disclose the due diligence certifications. 1358 The Commission notes that section 15E(s)(4)(D) of
the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall adopt a rule requiring an NRSRO that
receives a certification from a provider of third-party due diligence services to disclose the
certification to the public in a manner that allows the public to determine the adequacy and level
of the due diligence services provided by the third party. 1359 Moreover, the Commission believes
that the information contained in Form ABS Due Diligence-15E will be useful to investors and
to other users of the NRSRO’s credit ratings. Therefore, disclosing the information in the form
that will accompany the credit rating will associate the information with the credit rating. This
will make it easier for investors and other users of credit ratings to locate the information and it
will promote their use of the information in evaluating the credit rating and asset-backed security
that is the subject of the rating action. For these reasons, the Commission does not believe it
would be necessary or appropriate in the public interest, or consistent with the protection of
investors to exempt NRSROs from the requirement to include the due diligence certifications
with their forms. 1360

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the specific amendments

relating to the forms and certifications that an NRSRO must publish when taking certain rating
actions. 1361 The baseline that existed before today’s amendments was one in which NRSROs
were not required by Commission rules to publish specified information when taking a rating
action. However, today’s amendments contain requirements for the disclosure of certain types of
information with the publication of certain rating actions that an applicant or NRSRO was
required, before these amendments, to report generally with respect to all of its credit ratings on
Form NRSRO. For example, before today’s amendments, the instructions for Exhibit 2 to Form
NRSRO required the disclosure of a general description of the procedures and methodologies
used by the NRSRO to determine credit ratings. This description must address, among other
items, the quantitative and qualitative models and metrics and the public and non-public sources
of information, including data and analysis provided by third-party vendors, used to determine
credit ratings. This information was not, however, required to be disclosed at the level of
individual rating actions, so users of credit ratings interested in a particular rating action may not
have known, for example, the “version of the procedure or methodology used” or the “types of
data…that were relied on” to determine the credit rating in question, as required to be disclosed
with the publication of certain credit rating actions under the amendments.
Before today’s amendments, some NRSROs provided, but were not required by the
Commission to provide, additional disclosures on their public websites with respect to all of their
credit ratings, such as a description of the intended informational content of their credit ratings
and a general discussion of the uncertainty and risk factors to which their credit ratings are
subject. Also, in some public press releases and reports to subscribers issued in connection with

1361

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may
derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today. The economic effects related to the
certification of third-party due diligence providers are discussed below in more detail in section II.H.4. of
this release.

352

rating actions, NRSROs have discussed certain risk factors specific to a given rating action or
provided information or web addresses directing interested persons to the descriptions of
methodologies that are relevant for that particular rating action, though such disclosures were not
required.
Relative to this baseline, the amendments being adopted today may benefit users of credit
ratings because the forms may provide new information specific to a given rating action or may
clearly direct users of credit ratings to information that may already have been available.
Specifically, as discussed above, the information provided in the forms will include, among other
things: (1) information about the content of the credit rating; (2) the main assumptions and
principles and the version of the methodology used to determine the credit rating; (3) a
description of the types of data that were relied on and whether due diligence services and
servicer or remittance reports were used for the purpose of determining the credit rating; (4)
information relating to potential conflicts of interest; and (5) information about the potential
limitations, uncertainty, sensitivity to assumptions, and potential volatility of the credit rating. 1362
The disclosure of this information and the other required content of the forms may benefit
users of credit ratings by allowing them to better understand how credit ratings are produced and
the information content of credit ratings, including how these factors vary across NRSROs.
Also, the information disclosed in the form – particularly information about the potential
limitations, uncertainty and potential volatility of the credit rating, the sensitivity of the credit
rating to assumptions made by the NRSRO, and information regarding the due diligence services
used in rating Exchange Act-ABS – may discourage undue reliance on credit ratings by investors
and other users of credit ratings in making investment and other credit-based decisions. The

1362

See paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 17g-7 (prescribing the information that must be disclosed in the form).

353

disclosures, and particularly the attestation requirement, also may encourage enhanced integrity
in the production of credit ratings.
If the forms increase the ability of users of credit ratings to compare the assumptions,
data, and due diligence relied on by different NRSROs, the adopted rules and amendments may
have beneficial competitive effects by enhancing the reputation of NRSROs that users of credit
ratings view as being more thorough or as providing more informative credit ratings on the basis
of these reviews. Also, to the extent that the forms allow investors to more accurately interpret
the information conveyed by credit ratings, they may result in more efficient investment
decisions and higher overall market efficiency. 1363 However, the benefits of the forms may be
limited to the extent that standardized language and a high level of narrative in the forms limit
the amount of useful information that can readily be acquired from the disclosures or the extent
to which the information may be easily compared across NRSROs.
The amendments will result in compliance costs to NRSROs. The Commission believes
that NRSROs will be able to develop disclosures that are standardized to some degree for
particular types of credit ratings and, when they publish individual rating actions, to tailor those
disclosures appropriately to each such rating action. NRSROs will therefore bear one-time costs
to develop a template for the form and to produce any disclosures that can be standardized across
and within various credit rating classes, asset classes, and types of rating actions. As part of this
process, NRSROs will likely identify the required disclosure items that, based on their individual
credit rating methodologies and procedures, may share common elements across these various
subgroups. For example, some or all of the disclosure required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C) of
Rule 17g-7 (with respect to the main assumptions and principles used in constructing the
1363

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

354

procedures and methodologies used to determine the credit rating) can likely be standardized
across credit ratings generated using the same procedures and methodologies. NRSROs may
then have to draft, review, and finalize any such common components of these disclosures.
NRSROs will bear additional one-time costs to establish systems, protocols, and
procedures for generating and publishing the form, attestation, and certifications when required.
These systems, protocols, and procedures may include processes by which the latest versions of
any standardized components of the disclosures will be stored, retrieved, and input into the form
when required. NRSROs may also have to consider how the other newly required information
will be generated, including how analyses constructed in the process of applying their credit
rating procedures and methodologies can be translated into some of the required disclosure and
whether additional analyses may be required, as well as at what stage and by which staff the
generation of this information will be undertaken. NRSROs also will need to establish systems,
protocols, and procedures to ensure that the form is populated with the required information
(including that any certifications received from a provider of third-party due diligence services
are attached to the form) and that the form, attestation, and certifications are published with the
associated credit rating.
The amendments also will result in ongoing costs to NRSROs. At the time of any rating
action that triggers the requirement, an NRSRO must produce disclosures for the particular rating
action and compile these into the form. This process may include retrieving any applicable
standardized components of the disclosure, revising this content if necessary to tailor it to the
particular rating action, and generating and including any additional tailored content that is
specific to the particular rating action. Some of the tailored components of the disclosure may be
relatively straightforward because they are primarily factual in nature, such as the assigned credit

355

rating, the identity of the obligor, security, or instrument, the version of the procedure or
methodology used to determine the credit rating, and the required information relating to
conflicts of interest. Other tailored components of the disclosure may require more consideration
and the application of analysis that was produced in the course of producing the credit rating or
the completion of additional analysis. Examples of required disclosure items that may require
more consideration or analysis include the explanation or measure of the potential volatility of
the credit rating and the information on the sensitivity of the credit rating to assumptions made
by the NRSRO required by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(K) and (a)(1)(ii)(M) of Rule 17g-7.
NRSROs also will bear ongoing costs to review the form, include any relevant
hyperlinks, attach applicable attestations and certifications to the form, and to publish the form as
required. Also, NRSROs will periodically need to update the standardized components of the
disclosures (for example, when methodologies are revised). The Commission’s estimates of the
total costs of these compliance efforts – which are based on analyses for purposes of the PRA –
are provided below.
The Commission received comments identifying costs and burdens, including significant
administrative, recordkeeping, technological, and compliance costs, including costs associated
with time spent by rating analysts and other NRSRO employees in complying with the proposed
amendments. 1364 Commenters also expressed concerns about the potential for the publication of
confidential or proprietary information. 1365 As stated above, the Commission is sensitive to the
costs resulting from its rules. In this regard, the Commission has modified the amendments from
the proposal in a number of ways to mitigate burdens. The Commission narrowed the scope of
rating actions that will trigger the disclosure requirement and provided an exemption for certain
1364

See Kroll Letter; Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter.

1365

See Barnard Letter; Siff Letter.

356

rating actions involving foreign obligors or foreign-issued securities or money market
instruments. The Commission also significantly reduced the reporting requirements relating to
representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms. All of these modifications were made
in response to concerns about burdens raised by commenters. The Commission also has clarified
the type of information that is required to be included in the form, which may address concerns
about burdens as well as concerns about the disclosure of confidential information raised by
commenters.
One NRSRO commented that the Commission, in the proposing release, had
underestimated the burden associated with the form because the proposed disclosure items would
not be able to be standardized across rating actions or asset class types and would require an
individual analysis of the rated transaction. 1366 While the Commission encourages NRSROs to
make the disclosures as specific to the particular rating action and as relevant to investors as
possible, it also believes, as discussed above, that NRSROs will be able to develop disclosures
that are standardized to some degree for particular types of credit ratings and, when they publish
individual rating actions, to tailor those disclosures appropriately to each such rating action.
Compliance costs should vary across NRSROs due to differences in the number of
sectors (such as asset classes, industries, and geographies) rated – which may affect the number
of standardized disclosures that will be created – and the number of rating actions each year
subject to the requirements, as well as the frequency with which the NRSROs change their
approaches to producing credit ratings or the sectors for which they produce credit ratings, and
any differences in the complexity of rating procedures and methodologies that may impact the
complexity of the forms. However, based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission

1366

See Morningstar Letter.

357

estimates that the amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 will result in total industry-wide
one-time costs to NRSROs of approximately $15,613,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to
NRSROs of approximately $196,783,000. 1367
Given that some of the compliance costs associated with creating and revising
standardized disclosures may not scale proportionately with size, and that costs should also vary
across NRSROs for the other reasons listed above, these amendments may negatively affect
competition through the disproportionate burden on small NRSROs and, for example, NRSROs
with procedures and methodologies that would result in more complex disclosure. 1368 The
amendments also may result in other costs. The Commission received comments from NRSROs
expressing concerns about potential delays in the issuance of ratings. 1369 The Commission is
sensitive to concerns that, in some instances, the need to draft and review these additional
disclosures may delay NRSROs in publishing preliminary and initial credit ratings, may result in
NRSROs taking fewer rating actions, may result in NRSROs taking more time to take rating
actions in response to changing conditions, and may particularly extend the amount of time
required for NRSROs to take steps which would require the NRSRO to revise the standardized
language prepared for the disclosures for certain asset classes or other sectors, such as making
appropriate changes to credit rating methodologies. Commenters also predicted a decline in the
transparency of credit ratings over time due to the increased standardization of disclosure, and
raised concerns that very extensive disclosures could overwhelm users of credit ratings or
1367

See section V.H. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs
identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.6. of this release.

obfuscate key points. 1370 As mentioned above, though section 15E(s)(3) identifies specific
qualitative and quantitative information that must be included in the form, the Commission has
modified the amendments from the proposals in a number of ways to mitigate burdens, which
may reduce the likelihood or extent of such impacts. However, any such effects may reduce the
information readily available to users of credit ratings and thus reduce the efficiency of their
investment decisions and potentially the efficiency of the overall market. 1371
The Commission considered the costs and benefits of reasonable alternatives to the
amendments. Section 15E(s)(3) of the Exchange Act identifies a significant amount of
information that the Commission’s rule must require to be disclosed in the form. Because the
statute is specific about the type of information to be included in the form, and the information
thus detailed by the statute is quite comprehensive, the rule text prescribing the required contents
of the form largely mirrors the statutory text. However, the Commission has applied some
discretion with respect to the format of the form and which rating actions must be accompanied
by the forms and certifications. One alternative to the approach in the amendments would be to
prescribe a specific form in which NRSROs would input the information required by the
amendments. Requiring NRSROs to use a standardized form could assist users of the form in
locating and analyzing items of information disclosed. On the other hand, a standardized form
with line items and fields to input information could cause NRSROs to provide disclosures that
are less thorough or tailored to their individual approaches, which could reduce transparency.
The Commission believes the approach it has taken in requiring that the content of the forms be
disclosed in numbered items that are presented in a consistent order across NRSROs, without, for

359

example, requiring that a prescribed form be filled out, strikes an appropriate balance in
implementing section 15E(s)(2) of the Exchange Act between the comparability of the
information provided and the flexibility to allow for meaningful disclosure.
Other alternatives would be, as the Commission proposed, to require the forms to be
disclosed even with affirmations or withdrawals that are not based on the NRSRO applying its
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings or, as the Commission proposed, to
require broader disclosures of representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms.
However, the additional information that these alternatives would make available to users of
credit ratings would likely not be significant, while, as raised by several commenters, 1372 the
burden to create these additional disclosures could be substantial.

THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

Section 932(a)(8) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 15E of the Exchange Act to
add paragraph (s)(4), “Due diligence services for asset-backed securities,” which contains four
provisions regarding due diligence services relating to an Exchange Act-ABS. 1373 Specifically,
section 15E(s)(4)(A) requires the issuer or underwriter of any asset-backed security to make
publicly available the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained
by the issuer or underwriter. 1374 Section 15E(s)(4)(B) requires that in any case in which thirdparty due diligence services are employed by an NRSRO, issuer, or underwriter, the person
providing the due diligence services shall provide written certification in a format provided in
1372

As discussed above, commenters raised concerns regarding the rating actions that would trigger the
disclosure requirement. See A.M. Best Letter; ASF Letter; DBRS Letter; Deloitte Letter; FSR Letter;
Moody’s Letter; S&P Letter. Commenters also raised concerns regarding the disclosures of
representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms. See DBRS II Letter. See also DBRS PRA
Letter; Kroll PRA Letter; Moody’s PRA Letter.

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 932(a)(8); 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s)(4). As stated above in section I.B.1. of this
release, the term Exchange Act-ABS as used throughout this release refers to an asset-backed security as
defined in section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(79).

section 15E(s)(4)(C) to any NRSRO that produces a rating to which such services relate. 1375
Section 15E(s)(4)(C) requires the Commission to establish the appropriate format and content for
the written certifications required under section 15E(s)(4)(B) to ensure that providers of due
diligence services have conducted a thorough review of data, documentation, and other relevant
information necessary for an NRSRO to provide an accurate credit rating. 1376 Finally, as
discussed above in section II.G.5. of this release, section 15E(s)(4)(D) of the Exchange Act
directs the Commission to adopt rules requiring an NRSRO, at the time at which it produces a
credit rating, to disclose the certification required by section 15E(s)(4)(B) to the public in a
manner that allows the public to determine the adequacy and level of due diligence services
provided by a third party. 1377
The Commission proposed amendments to Rule 314 of Regulation S-T and Form ABS15G, and proposed Rule 15Ga-2 to implement section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act. 1378
The Commission proposed amendments to Rule 17g-7 and proposed Rule 17g-10 and related
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to implement sections 15E(s)(4)(B), (C), and (D) of the Exchange
Act. 1379 The proposals, comments received on the proposals, and final rules are
discussed below.
1.

New Rule 15Ga-2 and Amendments to Form ABS-15G

The Commission re-proposed rules to implement section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange
Act, which requires that an issuer or underwriter of any Exchange Act-ABS make publicly
available the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the

issuer or underwriter. 1380 In October 2010, the Commission proposed to implement section
15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act as part of a set of rules proposed to implement section 945 of
the Dodd-Frank Act. 1381 After reviewing the comments to that proposal regarding issuer review
of assets in offerings of asset-backed securities, 1382 the Commission was persuaded that section
15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act, when considered in the context of sections 15E(s)(4)(B), (C),
and (D), 1383 should be interpreted more narrowly than in the proposal. 1384 Therefore, the
Commission re-proposed Rule 15Ga-2 to require an issuer or underwriter of any Exchange ActABS that is to be rated by an NRSRO to furnish a Form ABS-15G 1385 containing the findings
and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter. 1386
The Commission also proposed that if Form ABS-15G was furnished by the issuer, it must be
signed by the senior officer of the depositor in charge of securitization, and if Form ABS-15G

1382

See, e.g., comment letters from the American Bar Association (stating that “[section] 15E(s)(4)(A) was not
intended to be applied to all manner of third-party due diligence reports that may be obtained by an issuer
or underwriter, but instead was intended to be applied more narrowly, to any third-party due diligence
report prepared for an ABS issuer or underwriter specifically for the purpose of sharing it with a given

20, 2011), 76 FR 4231 (Jan. 25, 2011).

1385

As discussed below, Form ABS-15G is being amended today to incorporate Rule 15Ga-2. Form ABS-15G
was originally adopted for the purpose of providing disclosures required by the new disclosure
requirements of Rule 15Ga-1 (17 CFR 240.15Ga-1). See Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required
by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4499-4501.

1386

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33466-33470, 33538. The
Commission stated in the proposing release that the term issuer would mean the depositor or sponsor that
participates in the issuance of Exchange Act-ABS, which was consistent with proposed Rule 17g-10, but
did not include a definition of issuer within proposed Rule 15Ga-2. The Commission proposed to define
the term third-party due diligence report to mean any report containing findings and conclusions relating to
due diligence services as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed. See id. at 33467, n.532.

362

was furnished by the underwriter, then it must be signed by a duly authorized officer of the
underwriter. 1387
In addition, the Commission proposed that an issuer or underwriter would not need to
furnish Form ABS-15G if it obtains a representation from an NRSRO engaged to produce a
credit rating for the Exchange Act-ABS that the NRSRO will publicly disclose the findings and
conclusions of the third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter. 1388 As
proposed, the NRSRO’s representation must state that it will make the disclosure with the
publication of the credit rating five business days prior to the first sale in the offering in the form
generated pursuant to proposed paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-7. 1389 In this context, the
Commission stated in the proposing release that the term publicly disclose means to make the
findings and conclusions readily available to any users of credit ratings. 1390 Consequently, an
NRSRO that agreed to make the findings and conclusions available only to its subscribers or
prospective investors in the Exchange Act-ABS would not satisfy this proposed requirement.
The Commission recognized, however, that there may be instances where, notwithstanding an
issuer’s or underwriter’s reasonable reliance on a representation by an NRSRO, the NRSRO fails
to make the required information publicly available in the form pursuant to proposed paragraph
(a)(1) of Rule 17g-7 five business days prior to the first sale in the offering. 1391 Therefore, the
Commission proposed to require that if the NRSRO failed to make the information publicly

See id.

1390

See id. at 33468, n.534.

1391

See id. at 33468. Under the proposal, an NRSRO’s failure to disclose the certification would be a violation
of the requirement in proposed paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-7. See id. at 33540-33541.

363

available, an issuer or underwriter must furnish, two business days prior to the first sale in the
offering, Form ABS-15G with the information required by proposed Rule 15Ga-2. 1392
The Commission did not propose to require that disclosure about a third-party due
diligence report for registered Exchange Act-ABS transactions required by proposed Rule 15Ga2 be provided in the prospectus because such information only pertains to the findings and
conclusions of a third-party due diligence report relevant to the determination of a credit
rating. 1393 Under Rule 193, 1394 on the other hand, if an issuer were to use the third-party due
diligence report in connection with its review of disclosure in the prospectus about the pool
assets as required under Rule 193, it would be required to include the findings and conclusions in
the prospectus 1395 and, if the issuer attributed the findings and conclusions to the third party, that
third party’s consent to be named as an expert in the registration statement would need to be
obtained. 1396
The Commission also proposed that Rule 15Ga-2 would apply to issuers and underwriters
of both registered and unregistered offerings of Exchange Act-ABS. 1397 Accordingly, if a
municipal entity that sponsors or issues Exchange Act-ABS (“municipal Exchange Act-ABS”) or
an underwriter of municipal Exchange Act-ABS obtained a third-party due diligence report, as
defined by the proposed rule, and the municipal Exchange Act-ABS is to be rated by an NRSRO,

See id. at 33468, 33538.

1393

See id. at 33469.

1394

See 17 CFR 230.193. Rule 193 implemented section 945 of the Dodd-Frank Act by requiring that any
issuer registering the offer and sale of an Exchange Act-ABS perform a review of the assets underlying the
asset-backed security.

the proposal noted that Rule 15Ga-2 would apply. 1398 The Commission proposed to permit
municipal securitizers of Exchange Act-ABS, or underwriters in the offering, to provide the
information required by Form ABS-15G on the Electronic Municipal Market Access system
(“EMMA”). 1399
Commenters generally supported the overarching principle of proposed Rule 15Ga-2 but
were mixed about the specifics of how the rule should be implemented. 1400 As a result, the
Commission is adopting Rule 15Ga-2 and revised Form ABS-15G with some revisions to
address comments and to make clarifying changes. 1401 Commenters generally agreed that Rule
15Ga-2 should only apply to an Exchange Act-ABS that is to be rated by an NRSRO. 1402 The
Commission continues to believe for the reasons stated in the proposing release that section
15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act should be interpreted to relate only to Exchange Act-ABS that
are rated. 1403 Therefore, the Commission is adopting, generally as proposed, the requirement
that an issuer or underwriter of any Exchange Act-ABS that is to be rated by an NRSRO must

1400

See, e.g., CRE Letter (stating that it “does not oppose the concept of third-party asset review and
disclosure” but stated that the proposed rule and form needed “certain clarifications and modifications
regarding disclosure requirements and logistics”); Deloitte Letter (stating that it “support[s] the goals of
transparency and accountability underlying Section 932, but [believes] it is essential that the Commission
clarify certain aspects of the proposed rule”).

1401

The modifications to proposed Form ABS-15G are technical rather than substantive and include: (1) reordering the information supplied on the cover page to reflect the differences between Rule 15Ga-1 filings
and Rule 15Ga-2 furnishings; (2) changing “file” to “furnish” wherever it relates to Rule 15Ga-2
requirements; (3) removing references to the proposed NRSRO representation allowance that is not being
adopted; (4) revising the language in Item 2.02 to reflect that Rule 15Ga-2 refers to third-party due
diligence reports obtained by the underwriter rather than third parties managed by the underwriter; and (5)
adding “Depositor” as an option to the signature block. See Form ABS-15G.

1402

See, e.g., ABA Letter; ASF Letter; CRE Letter; DBRS Letter; Deloitte Letter.

1403

As explained in the proposing release, the Commission continues to believe that section 15E(s)(4)(A)
should be interpreted in the context of the accompanying provisions of section 15E(s)(4) to relate to a
particular type of report that is relevant to the determination of a credit rating by an NRSRO. See
Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33467-33469. This is in contrast with the
October 2010 proposal, where Rule 15Ga-2 was not limited to transactions rated by NRSROs. See Issuer
Review of Assets in Offerings of Asset-Backed Securities, 75 FR at 64183.

365

furnish a Form ABS-15G containing the findings and conclusions of any third-party due
diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter, with modifications to provide limited
exclusions for issuers and underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS in certain offshore transactions
and municipal issuer offerings, as discussed further below. 1404 Rule 15Ga-2 applies to Exchange
Act-ABS transactions that are rated by an NRSRO regardless of who pays for the credit rating,
and regardless of whether the Exchange Act-ABS is sold in a registered or unregistered
transaction, as described in more detail below. Several commenters suggested that the issuer’s or
underwriter’s requirement under Rule 15Ga-2 should apply only to third-party due diligence
reports that were provided to an NRSRO. 1405 The Commission is not, however, limiting the
applicability of Rule 15Ga-2 as these commenters suggest. The Commission does not believe it
is appropriate to limit the applicability of Rule 15Ga-2 in this manner because most, if not all,
third-party due diligence reports will be made available to NRSROs pursuant to Rule 17g-10. 1406
In the instance a third-party due diligence report that is obtained by the issuer or underwriter is
not provided to an NRSRO under Rule 17g-10, the Commission believes it is important for these
reports to be made publicly available by the issuer or underwriter in accordance with Rule 15Ga2 in order for users of credit ratings to evaluate the level of due diligence obtained by the issuer
1404

As discussed below in section II.H.2. of this release, the term issuer as defined for purposes of Rule 17g-10,
includes the sponsor or depositor that participates in the issuance of Exchange Act-ABS. See paragraph
(d)(2) of Rule 17g-10.

1405

See, e.g., Deloitte Letter; DBRS Letter. Some commenters further suggested that Rule 15Ga-2 should only
apply if the third-party due diligence report is actually used by the NRSRO. See ABA Letter (suggesting
an additional recommendation that “Rule 15Ga-2 should not apply to an Exchange Act-ABS transaction in
which the only rating that is issued is a rating that is paid for by a party other than the issuer, sponsor or
underwriter”); ASF Letter; CRE Letter (stating that the third-party due diligence report should be material
to the credit rating of the ABS in order for Rule 15Ga-2 to apply).

1406

As discussed below in sections II.H.2. and II.H.3. of this release, Rule 17g-10 (which defines terms such as
due diligence services) requires third-party due diligence providers to use new Form ABS Due Diligence15E to make the written certification to be provided to the NRSRO under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the
Exchange Act. The form elicits information about the due diligence performed including a description of
the work performed, a summary of the findings and conclusions of the third party, and the identification of
any relevant NRSRO due diligence criteria that the third party intended to meet in performing the due
diligence.

366

or underwriter as compared to the due diligence services used by an NRSRO rating the
securities. Similarly, the Commission is not persuaded to adopt the more restrictive
interpretation suggested by some commenters that Rule 15Ga-2 should only apply when a thirdparty due diligence report is both provided to an NRSRO and used by that NRSRO in its credit
rating determination. The Commission understands there may be instances when the NRSRO
may not actually use that third-party due diligence report in determining a credit rating; however,
it is not clear that an issuer or underwriter would be able to determine whether a third-party due
diligence report was actually used by the NRSRO. 1407 Moreover, by not limiting Rule 15Ga-2 in
this way, users of credit ratings will be able to determine if there are differences between the
information provided to NRSROs, as disclosed under Rules 17g-7 and 17g-10, and the
information obtained by the issuer or underwriter, as disclosed in accordance with Rule 15Ga-2,
and evaluate the significance, if any, of those differences.
A few commenters suggested that section 15E(s)(4)(A) should not apply to privately
offered, unregistered Exchange Act-ABS, 1408 while one commenter suggested that the findings
and conclusions of third-party due diligence providers should not be made publicly available on
EDGAR for private or confidential transactions. 1409 After considering these comments, the
Commission continues to believe that section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act should be

1407

See, e.g., ASF Letter (stating that the “issuer or underwriter would not or may not know whether: a) an
engaged NRSRO elected to disregard a report provided to it, b) an engaged NRSRO accessed and
considered a report provided to a different engaged NRSRO via its Rule 17g-5 website, c) an engaged
NRSRO directly retained a [third-party due diligence services] [p]rovider, or d) a non-engaged NRSRO
accessed and considered a report provided to an engaged NRSRO via its Rule 17g-5 website.”).

1408

See ABA Letter (commenting that the use of the terms underwriter and publicly available in section 932 of
the Dodd-Frank Act makes the requirement fundamentally inconsistent with private placements). See also
ASF Letter (suggesting that (1) Congress may have intended to exclude unregistered offerings by the use of
the term underwriter and (2) “[i]n the unregistered context, the timing related rationale for the issuer and
underwriter’s disclosure duty under Rule 15Ga-2 is entirely inapplicable”).

1409

See S&P Letter. This commenter does not indicate if “private or confidential transactions” means
something other than unregistered offerings.

367

interpreted to apply to issuers and underwriters of both registered and unregistered offerings of
Exchange Act-ABS. The Commission is not persuaded that Congress’ use of the term
underwriters was meant to limit the applicability of section 15E(s)(4)(A) to registered offerings,
as the definition of underwriter in the Exchange Act is not explicitly limited to registered
offerings. 1410 Moreover, section 15E(s)(4)(A) uses the Exchange Act definition of asset-backed
securities, which is much broader than the definition of asset-backed security in Regulation
AB. 1411 The definition of asset-backed security in section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act
expressly includes securities that are almost exclusively offered in unregistered offerings, such as
CDOs. 1412 In other contexts where the Commission has adopted or proposed rules that apply to
Exchange Act-ABS, those rules have been applied to both registered and unregistered offerings
of asset-backed securities. 1413 Moreover, the Commission believes there are sound policy
reasons why both registered and unregistered Exchange Act-ABS offerings should be covered by
section 15(E)(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Commission believes that the benefits of
making the findings and conclusions of third-party due diligence reports publicly available,
which would include providing more information about the contents of these reports, 1414 equally
apply to registered or unregistered offerings since both types of offerings can be the subject of a

1410

See section 3(c)(20) of the Exchange Act (15 USC 78c(a)(20)) which refers to the definition of underwriter
set forth in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. See also section 202(a)(20) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 (15 USC 80b-2(a)(20)).

As discussed below, the Commission believes this information would necessarily include the criteria
against which the loans were evaluated, and how the evaluated loans compared to those criteria along with
the basis for including any loans not meeting those criteria. See instruction to paragraph (a) of Rule 15Ga2.

368

credit rating. 1415 The Commission continues to believe that, since section 15E(s)(4) relates to
oversight of NRSROs and the ratings process and such oversight is not limited to registered
offerings, it is not appropriate to exempt any particular issuers or underwriters who offer
securities to U.S. investors if they receive a credit rating for the securities. 1416
Commenters were also concerned that requiring issuers and underwriters to make
information available for private placements would violate rules prohibiting general
solicitation. 1417 The Commission continues to believe, as explained in the proposing release, 1418
that issuers and underwriters can disclose information required by Rule 15Ga-2 without
jeopardizing their reliance on private offering exemptions and safe harbors under the Securities
Act, provided the only information made publicly available on Form ABS-15G is required by the
rule, and the issuer does not otherwise use Form ABS-15G to offer or sell securities in a manner
that conditions the market for offers or sales of its securities. Moreover, issuers are now
permitted to engage in general solicitation or general advertising if they are offering and selling
securities pursuant to Rule 506(c) or Rule 144A under the Securities Act, provided that all
purchasers of the securities are accredited investors and the issuer has taken reasonable steps to
verify that such purchasers are accredited investors, for Rule 506(c) offerings, or qualified
institutional buyers, for Rule 144A offerings. 1419

1415

As noted above, one commenter suggested the rule should not apply to “private or confidential
transactions.” To the extent such transactions are rated, the Commission believes the disclosures required
by Rule 15Ga-2 would be equally beneficial to an assessment of the resulting credit ratings.

1416

As discussed below, issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS are being excluded from the
requirements of Rule 15Ga-2 but will continue to be subject to the statutory obligation under section
15E(s)(4)(A) to make the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence reports they obtain
publicly available.

369

Commenters suggested that Rule 15Ga-2 should exclude offshore transactions. 1420 The
Commission agrees that, in light of the practical and legal considerations raised by commenters,
certain offshore transactions should be exempted and is adopting revisions to provide that Rule
15Ga-2 as well as section 15E(s)(4)(A) will not apply to certain offshore offerings of Exchange
Act-ABS, 1421 consistent with revisions being adopted in Rule 17g-7. 1422 Under this exemption,
the requirements of Rule 15Ga-2 and section 15E(s)(4)(A) will not apply to an offering of
Exchange Act-ABS if: (1) the offering is not required to be, and is not, registered under the
Securities Act; (2) the issuer of the rated security is not a U.S. person (as defined under
Securities Act Rule 902(k)); 1423 and (3) the security issued by the issuer will be offered and sold
upon issuance, and that any underwriter or arranger linked to the security will effect transactions
of the security after issuance, only in transactions that occur outside the United States. 1424
Several commenters provided views on the proposed timeframe for furnishing Form
ABS-15G. One commenter noted that the proposed five business day timeframe parallels a
requirement in the proposed revisions to asset-backed securities regulations (“Regulation AB

See ABA Letter (indicating that the application of Rule 15Ga-2 to offshore transactions invokes the same

regulations); DBRS Letter.

when taking a rating action if the rated obligor or issuer of the rated security is not a U.S. person and if the
NRSRO has a reasonable basis to conclude that the security will be offered and sold upon issuance and that
any underwriter or arranger linked to the security will effect transactions in the security after issuance only
in transactions outside the United States. See paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17g-7. While one commenter
requested that the Commission adopt an exemption for foreign transactions in Rule 15Ga-2 similar to that
proposed in the credit risk retention rules, the Commission believes it is more appropriate for this
exemption to be aligned with the exemption in Rule 17g-7 so that there is a consistent approach to
determining when the Commission’s NRSRO rules apply to offshore transactions. See ABA Letter.

II rules, then a corresponding change under Rule 15Ga-2 should be made. 1426 This commenter
also suggested that Rule 15Ga-2 should not impose a deadline for furnishing Form ABS-15G in
an unregistered offering that differs from the time an NRSRO is required to publish its report
under Rule 17g-7. 1427 Another commenter stated that the proposed five business day delay prior
to the first sale in an offering under Regulation AB II would be unnecessarily long in many
circumstances. 1428 Another commenter, however, stated that the proposed five business day
timeframe prior to a first sale would not be sufficient time for an NRSRO to review most
issuances of asset-backed securities, 1429 while one commenter supported the proposed five
business day timeframe. 1430 After considering the comments, the Commission has decided to
adopt, as proposed, the requirement that an issuer or underwriter must furnish Form ABS-15G at
least five business days prior to the first sale in the offering. 1431 The Commission believes that
the proposed five business day time period strikes an appropriate balance between issuers’ and
underwriters’ timing concerns and allows users of credit ratings, including investors, NRSROs,

See paragraph (a) of Rule 15Ga-2. One commenter requested that the meaning of the term first sale in the
offering be clarified in the final rule. See ABA Letter. As with other regulations adopted by the
Commission, the date of first sale in the offering is the date at which the purchaser makes an investment
decision and commits to purchase the securities offered. See, e.g., Electronic Filing and Revision of Form
D, Securities Act Release No. 8891 (Feb. 6, 2008), 73 FR 10599 (Feb. 27, 2008). See also instruction to

and other market participants, in combination with the disclosure mandated by Rules 17g-7 and
17g-10, adequate time to evaluate the extent to which the rating process has incorporated the
findings and conclusions of third-party due diligence reports obtained and disclosed by the issuer
and underwriter. 1432 The Commission believes that adopting a deadline to furnish Form ABS15G that matches the deadlines for an NRSRO to publish its reports under Rule 17g-7 or Rule
17g-10 would not provide enough certainty about how far in advance of sale a user of a credit
rating could expect the information, because NRSROs are required to make this information
available when they take a rating action, which could vary among NRSROs and Exchange ActABS issuances. The Commission also believes that the timeframe for Rule 15Ga-2 should not be
tied to the timeframe under Regulation AB II, as they serve different purposes. 1433 Finally, for
the same reasons noted above, the Commission does not believe it is appropriate to differentiate
between registered and unregistered offerings under this rule, so the Commission is adopting the
five business-day requirement regardless of whether the transaction is registered or exempt.
The Commission is adopting, as proposed, the requirement that a Form ABS-15G
furnished by the issuer must be signed by the senior officer of the depositor in charge of
securitization, and a Form ABS-15G furnished by the underwriter must be signed by a duly
authorized officer of the underwriter. The Commission agrees with the commenter that

1432

As stated above, the findings and conclusions that are made public under Rule 15Ga-2 include all thirdparty due diligence reports that are obtained by the issuer or underwriter, which is more than what an
NRSRO may receive under Rule 17g-10 or may use and disclose under Rule 17g-7. Users of credit ratings
would have five business days before the first sale to compare the totality of third-party due diligence
information with what was provided to, and used by, an NRSRO, as disclosed under Rules 17g-7 and 17g10.

1433

As discussed in this section, the disclosure made under Rule 15Ga-2 is for the benefit of the users of credit
ratings including investors looking to make an investment decision. Accordingly, the timing of the
publication of third-party due diligence report findings and conclusions, which may be available far in
advance of the first sale in the offering, serves a different purpose than delivery of preliminary offering
materials under Regulation AB II.

372

suggested 1434 that a single Form ABS-15G may be furnished when the issuer and/or one or more
underwriters have obtained the same third-party due diligence report and has revised the final
rule to clarify this point. 1435 For example, if the issuer and an underwriter obtain the same thirdparty due diligence report related to a particular asset-backed security and the issuer timely
furnishes a Form ABS-15G for that report, the underwriter has no obligation to furnish a Form
ABS-15G for the same third-party due diligence report. Similarly, if a transaction has more than
one underwriter, and two or more of those underwriters obtain the same third-party due diligence
report related to a particular asset-backed security, only one of those underwriters must timely
furnish Form ABS-15G for that report. Commenters also requested clarification that a
requirement to provide the findings and conclusions of third-party due diligence reports would
apply only to the initial credit rating and not to any subsequent upgrades, downgrades, or other
rating actions. 1436 The Commission agrees that once the information has been disclosed in
connection with an initial credit rating, it does not need to be furnished again in connection with
any subsequent rating actions. Accordingly, as clarified in the instructions to the final rule, Form
ABS-15G does not need to be furnished for any subsequent updates to a credit rating issued by
an NRSRO.
While one commenter supported the Commission’s proposed approach of defining the
third-party due diligence reports covered by the rule, 1437 a number of other commenters wanted

See ABA Letter; DBRS Letter.

1437

See CFA/AFR Letter (stating that they “share the view, cited by the Commission, that the variation for
reviews of different types of offerings is likely to be significant and that this area therefore is better served
by principles-based standards than by prescriptive rules”). However, this commenter did object to the
Commission’s decision to withdraw the approach proposed in the October 2010 proposal, where issuers
and underwriters of registered Exchange Act-ABS would have been required to make third-party due
diligence disclosures in the prospectus. The commenter suggested that the revised approach is
unnecessarily complex and should be simplified.

373

the definitions of third-party due diligence report and due diligence services (defined in proposed
Rule 17g-10, 1438 which is the basis for the term third-party due diligence report in Rule 15Ga-2)
to be narrowed in a variety of ways. After considering these comments, the Commission is
adopting, as proposed, the definition of third-party due diligence report to mean any report
containing findings and conclusions of any due diligence services (as defined in Rule 17g-10)
performed by a third party. 1439 One commenter suggested that, in the definition of third-party
due diligence report, the phrase “final report” replace the phrase “any report.” 1440 The
Commission is not, however, replacing the phrase “any report” with the phrase “final report,” as
suggested by some commenters, in part because “any report” was specified by Congress in the
Dodd-Frank Act. Moreover, the Commission believes all third-party due diligence reports
obtained by the issuer or underwriter, including interim reports, related to an offering of assetbacked securities should be made publicly available in order for users of credit ratings to more
thoroughly evaluate the level of due diligence obtained by the issuer or underwriter as compared
to the due diligence services used by an NRSRO rating the Exchange Act-ABS. One commenter
requested that the Commission revise the phrase “containing the findings and conclusions” to
“containing a summary of the findings and conclusions,” noting that providing a summary is

A summary of comments addressing the definition of due diligence services is provided in section II.H.2.
of this release.

1439

See paragraph (d) of Rule 15Ga-2; see also paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17g-10 (defining the term due
diligence services). Although the Commission is not modifying the definition of third-party due diligence
report, it is making some changes to, and providing guidance on some aspects of, the definition of due
diligence services in Rule 17g-10. For example, as discussed below in section II.H.2. of this release, the
Commission is: (1) modifying the first prong of the definition of due diligence services by replacing the
phrase “quality and integrity” of the data with the word “accuracy;” (2) providing guidance that the
“catchall” provision of the definition of due diligence services relates to reviews of the assets underlying
the Exchange Act-ABS (as opposed to the reviews of the Exchange Act-ABS itself); and (3) providing
guidance that it would not object to the inclusion of the description of the requirements and limitations
resulting from relevant professional standards generally described within the reports being included in the
disclosure.

1440

See Clayton Letter.

374

more appropriate than providing the findings and conclusions themselves, and that there is no
reason why the summary would not be substantially similar in each context. 1441 The
Commission is not adopting this alternative for several reasons. First, the Commission notes that
Congress specified in the Dodd-Frank Act that “the findings and conclusions” must be made
publicly available, which the Commission believes would be most appropriately interpreted as
precluding a summary. Moreover, the Commission believes it is important for the third-party
due diligence provider’s findings and conclusions themselves to be made public rather than an
issuer or underwriter’s summary of those findings and conclusions because a summary runs the
risk of excluding information that could be important to a user of credit ratings. 1442 Specifically,
the Commission believes that disclosure of the findings and conclusions necessarily requires
disclosure of the criteria against which the loans were evaluated, and how the evaluated loans
compared to those criteria along with the basis for including any loans not meeting those
criteria. 1443 The Commission is also revising the rule to clarify that the term issuer is defined in
Rule 17g-10. 1444
Several commenters objected to the proposal that an issuer or underwriter would not be
required to furnish Form ABS-15G if it reasonably relies upon the representation from an
NRSRO rating the transaction that the NRSRO will publicly disclose the required information

1441

See ABA Letter.

1442

As noted above, the Commission believes users of credit ratings should be able to compare the totality of
third-party due diligence information with what was provided to, and used by, an NRSRO, as disclosed
under Rules 17g-7 and 17g-10.

1443

See instruction to paragraph (a) of Rule 15Ga-2. This is the same disclosure standard for findings and
conclusions that is required under Item 1111(a)(7)(ii) of Regulation AB. See Issuer Review of Assets in
Offerings of Asset-Backed Securities, 76 FR 4238.

1444

See paragraph (d) of Rule 15Ga-2 and paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g-10. As explained above, the proposing
release did not include a definition of issuer in Rule 15Ga-2 but indicated that the term would be
interpreted in a manner consistent with the definition in Rule 17g-10. For clarity and consistency, the
Commission has revised the rule text to expressly refer to the definition in Rule 17g-10.

five business days prior to the first sale in the offering. 1445 One commenter supported this part of
the proposal, noting that it could reduce duplicative disclosures. 1446 After considering these
comments, the Commission is not adopting this part of the proposal. While the Commission
would like to avoid duplicative disclosure wherever possible, it has determined that the
representation may be difficult to implement in practice. NRSROs generally opposed this
proposal, 1447 and a number of NRSROs, as well as a trade organization with NRSRO members,
noted that it is unlikely that any NRSRO would make such a representation, 1448 making it
unlikely that much duplicative disclosure would actually be avoided. One commenter thought
that there could be a potential for discrepancies in the representations made by NRSROs that
operate under the subscriber-pay business model and the issuer-pay model. This commenter
noted that these NRSROs could be in compliance with Rule 17g-7, as proposed to be amended,
without actually making the findings and conclusions of a third-party due diligence report
publicly available. 1449 As explained in the proposing release, an NRSRO that operates under the
subscriber-pay model (rather than the issuer-pay model) and only makes the third-party due

1447

See, e.g., Moody’s Letter (strongly opposing the exemption because the commenter believes: (1) it is
contrary to the express intent of Congress to promote greater transparency and accountability among
Exchange Act-ABS issuers; (2) it is contrary to the efforts of Congress, the Commission and others to
clarify the limited role of credit rating agencies in the financial markets; (3) it is unlikely to reduce the
potential for multiple, inconsistent disclosures about the due diligence services; and (4) it will create
incentives for issuers and underwriters to select NRSROs who are willing to make these representations).
See also S&P Letter (stating that issuers and underwriters should bear this obligation because NRSRO
disclosure of the required information could confuse investors regarding who is providing the required
information).

1448

See CRE Letter (suggesting that the rule allow NRSROs and underwriters to rely on disclosure made by
issuers); Morningstar Letter; S&P Letter.

1449

See ASF Letter. As discussed above in section II.G.1. of this release, Rule 17g-7, as proposed to be
amended, required, in part, that NRSROs must, when taking a rating action, publish and make available to
the same persons who can receive or access the credit rating that is the result or the subject of the rating
action, a form and any written certification received by the NRSRO from a provider of third-party due
diligence services under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act. The form would include, among other
things, a description of the findings or conclusions of any third-party due diligence services used by the
NRSRO.

376

diligence findings and conclusions available to its subscribers would not be able to make a
representation to an issuer or underwriter that it is making the required information publicly
available. 1450 Consequently, this may give issuer-paid NRSROs a competitive advantage over
subscriber-paid NRSROs. Further, the disclosure of the findings and conclusions in the thirdparty due diligence report made by an NRSRO would need to be as comprehensive as what is
required for issuers and underwriters under Rule 15Ga-2 in order to make such a representation.
Because Rule 17g-7 only requires that an NRSRO disclose a description of the findings and
conclusions, NRSROs, issuers, and underwriters would have to make judgments as to whether
the disclosure made in accordance with Rule 17g-7 meets the standard for disclosure of the
findings and conclusions under Rule 15Ga-2, as set forth in the instruction to paragraph (a) of
Rule 15Ga-2, before an NRSRO could make, or an issuer or underwriter could rely, on such a
representation. In addition, if issuers and underwriters were allowed to rely on such a
representation in order to not furnish Form ABS-15G, there would be no central location where
users of credit ratings could obtain the findings and conclusions of all third-party due diligence
reports on Exchange Act-ABS. Finally, allowing issuers and underwriters to rely on a
representation may have resulted in gaps in the information that is disclosed on Form ABS15G. 1451 These results would impair the intended benefits of the rule. Based on the totality of
comments and the implications of allowing issuers and underwriters to rely on a representation
from an NRSRO in lieu of furnishing Form ABS-15G, the Commission has determined that the
potential benefit of eliminating redundant disclosure by allowing the representation does not
justify the uncertainty and costs that it may create.

See, e.g., Moody’s Letter; S&P Letter.

377

As stated above, the Commission continues to believe that there is no need to separately
require that disclosure provided in connection with Rule 15Ga-2 about any third-party due
diligence report be provided in the prospectus for a registered offering. 1452 The Commission
considered one commenter’s suggestion that a separate database be created where all third-party
due diligence report findings and conclusions could be centralized. 1453 The Commission,
however, believes that the EDGAR system is the more appropriate place for issuers and
underwriters to make this information publicly available. When information is electronically
filed with the Commission on the EDGAR system, investors, market participants, and
Commission staff can access the information from a single, permanent, and centralized location.
Creating a new system may be duplicative and may result in additional costs for issuers and
underwriters beyond those that would be incurred by using the EDGAR system without
providing a significant improvement in making the information available to users of credit
ratings. The additional costs incurred by issuers and underwriters of registered Exchange ActABS offerings by having to furnish Form ABS-15G on the EDGAR system should be
incremental, 1454 as they are already required to file other forms and documents on EDGAR.
Issuers and underwriters of unregistered Exchange Act-ABS offerings, however, may incur
higher costs compared to those conducting registered offerings if they need to adjust their
systems or engage outside counsel to prepare and furnish Form ABS-15G on EDGAR. 1455

1452

Whether the findings and conclusions of a third-party are part of the Rule 193 review and, therefore,
included in the prospectus disclosure is dictated by the requirements of Rule 193 and Item 1111 of
Regulation AB. See 17 CFR 230.193; 17 CFR 229.1111.

1453

See CFA/AFR Letter.

1454

See section IV.D.10. of this release (discussing the PRA burden resulting from this requirement).

1455

The Commission notes, however, that issuers and underwriters of unregistered Exchange Act-ABS
offerings who already file Form ABS-15G on EDGAR in accordance with Rule 15Ga-1 should not incur
these additional costs.

378

Commenters noted that issuers of registered offerings may incorporate third-party
reviews into their registration statement disclosure in order to comply with the review of the
underlying assets required by Rule 193. One of these commenters suggested that when
disclosures under both Rule 193 and Rule 15Ga-2 might otherwise be required, the Rule 193
disclosures should suffice for both purposes. 1456 Another commenter encouraged the
Commission to enhance the efficiency of this new regulatory framework by including an
exception that where disclosures about third-party due diligence services comply with Rule 193,
those same services would not be subject to Rule 15Ga-2. 1457 After considering these comments,
the Commission has revised Rule 15Ga-2 to reflect that if the disclosure required by Rule 15Ga2 has been made in the prospectus (including an attribution to the third party that provided the
due diligence report), 1458 and the prospectus is publicly available at the time Form ABS-15G is
furnished by the issuer or underwriter, the issuer or underwriter may refer to that section of the
prospectus in Form ABS-15G rather than providing the findings and conclusions directly in
Form ABS-15G. 1459 This does not, however, exempt an issuer or underwriter from the
requirements of Rule 15Ga-2, including its duty to furnish Form ABS-15G. The Commission
continues to believe that, in addition to disclosures made by the NRSROs, Form ABS-15G is the

1456

See CRE Letter.

1457

See Deloitte Letter (noting that when issuers hire third parties to conduct the Rule 193 due diligence
review, the disclosures required under Rule 193 will be substantially similar to the disclosures made about
the same findings and conclusions in the context of the rules adopted under section 932).

1458

The Commission does not intend for all third parties from whom the issuer obtains a third-party due
diligence report, as defined in Rule 15Ga-2, to be named in the registration statement and consent to being
named as an expert solely because an issuer furnishes Form ABS-15G. If the issuer’s prospectus disclosure
attributes the findings and conclusions of the Rule 193 review to the third party from whom it obtains a
third-party due diligence report, however, the third-party would be required to be named in the registration
statement and consent to being named as an expert in accordance with Rule 436 under the Securities Act.

most appropriate place to find information about a particular type of report that is relevant to the
determination of a credit rating by an NRSRO.
Two comments submitted in response to the proposing release related to the impact on
municipal issuers and underwriters. One commenter cautioned the Commission against
imposing the new Exchange Act-ABS disclosure requirements on the municipal securities
market until the completion of the reports on municipal securities mandated by the Dodd-Frank
Act. 1460 The Commission notes that the reports required by sections 976 and 977 of the DoddFrank Act have been completed by the GAO and have not resulted in any legislative changes to
disclosure requirements applicable to municipal issuers at this time. 1461 This commenter
recommended that the Commission exempt municipal securities from the proposed disclosure
requirements to avoid creating confusion for investors and issuers in case different classes of
municipal securities are subject to different requirements in the future. 1462 Another commenter
supported the proposal to allow municipal securitizers or underwriters of municipal Exchange
Act-ABS to provide the required information on EMMA. 1463
The Commission also has considered the comments objecting to requiring municipal
issuers and underwriters to comply with Rule 15Ga-2, which were submitted in response to the
October 2010 proposal. 1464 A number of these commenters expressed the view that sections
15B(d)(1) and 15B(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, known collectively as the “Tower

Amendment,” 1465 expressly prohibit the Commission and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board (“MSRB”) from requiring an issuer of municipal securities to make any specific
disclosure filing with the Commission or MSRB prior to the sale of these securities to
investors. 1466 After considering these comments, the Commission has determined that issuers
and underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS should be excluded from the requirements of
Rule 15Ga-2. The Commission notes that, in reaching this determination, it does not find it
necessary to determine whether the Tower Amendment applies in this situation and no inference
should be drawn from this determination regarding the Commission’s analysis of the Tower
Amendment. In light of the fact that municipal issuers and underwriters will remain subject to
the statutory requirement in section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act to make the findings and
conclusions of any third-party due diligence reports publicly available, and given the
Commission’s historical approach of not requiring municipal issuers to file disclosures with the
Commission in connection with the issuance of securities, the Commission is persuaded that, as a
policy matter, it is unnecessary to apply Rule 15Ga-2 to municipal issuers and underwriters. 1467
Under the exclusion, the requirements of Rule 15Ga-2 will not apply to issuers and
underwriters of an offering of Exchange Act-ABS if: (1) the issuer of the rated security is a
municipal issuer; and (2) the offering is not required to be registered under the Securities Act. A

Municipal securitizers continue to be subject to Rule 15Ga-1. As the Commission noted at the time Rule
15Ga-1 was adopted, section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Act, pursuant to which Rule 15Ga-1 was adopted, is a
stand-alone statutory provision that does not expressly provide the Commission with authority to provide
exemptions for particular classes of securitizers, including municipal securitizers. See Disclosure for
Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, 76 FR at 4493.

municipal issuer is defined as an issuer (as that term is defined in paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g10) that is any State or Territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, any political
subdivision of any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or any public instrumentality of
one or more States, Territories, or the District of Columbia. The exclusion further provides, as
discussed below, that issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS remain subject
to the requirements of section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act. 1468
Although the Commission is excluding issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange
Act-ABS from the application of Rule 15Ga-2, the Commission continues to believe that section
15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act should be interpreted to apply to such entities. By its terms,
section 15E(s)(4)(A) applies to issuers and underwriters of “any asset-backed security,” and the
Commission believes the intended benefits of greater transparency with respect to the credit
rating process apply equally to credit ratings of municipal Exchange Act-ABS. 1469 The
Commission also notes that section 15E(s)(4)(A) requires issuers and underwriters to make the
specified information publicly available and does not mandate filing with the Commission,
which was the specific concern the Tower Amendment sought to address. Consequently,
although municipal issuers and underwriters will not be required to furnish Form ABS-15G
pursuant to Rule 15Ga-2, they are subject to the statutory requirement under section
15E(s)(4)(A) to make publicly available the findings and conclusions of any third-party due
diligence report they obtain. Municipal issuers and underwriters may make such information
available through any means reasonably accessible to the public, including, for example, by
posting the information on an issuer or underwriter sponsored Internet website, by voluntarily

See paragraph (f) of Rule 15Ga-2.

1469

As discussed above, the Commission believes that section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act should be
interpreted to apply to issuers and underwriters of both registered and unregistered offerings of Exchange
Act-ABS.

furnishing Form ABS-15G on EDGAR, or by voluntarily submitting a Form ABS-15G on
EMMA.
Since the Commission is excluding issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange ActABS from the application of Rule 15Ga-2, it is not adopting the proposed revisions to Rule 314,
which would have permitted municipal issuers of Exchange Act-ABS, or underwriters in the
offering, to provide the information required by Form ABS-15G on EMMA, as proposed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, as noted above, an issuer or underwriter of municipal Exchange
Act-ABS could choose to satisfy its obligation to make publicly available the findings and
conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter, as
required by section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act, by voluntarily submitting a Form ABS15G on EMMA. 1470

New Rule 17g-10

As stated above, section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act requires the issuer or
underwriter of any asset-backed security to make publicly available the findings and conclusions
of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter. 1471 Section
15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act requires that in any case in which third-party due diligence
services are employed by an NRSRO, issuer, or underwriter, the person providing the due
diligence services shall provide, to any NRSRO that produces a credit rating to which such
services relate, written certification, in a format as provided in section 15E(s)(4)(C). 1472 Section

The Commission adopted Rule 314 to permit municipal securitizers to satisfy the obligation to furnish the
information required by Rule 15Ga-1 by filing the information on EMMA. See Disclosure for AssetBacked Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, 76 FR 4489. Accordingly, EMMA will be prepared to accept Form ABS-15G in
connection with this requirement.

15E(s)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall establish the appropriate
format and content for the written certifications required under section 15E(s)(4)(B) to ensure
that providers of due diligence services have conducted a thorough review of data,
documentation, and other relevant information necessary for an NRSRO to provide an accurate
rating. 1473 The Commission proposed to implement these sections through Rule 17g-10
and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 1474 As proposed, Rule 17g-10 would require a provider of
third-party due diligence services to provide the written certification required by section
15E(s)(4)(B) of Exchange Act on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E.
The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-10 with modifications from the proposal in
response to comments. 1475 As discussed below, the modifications add a “safe harbor” for the
third-party due diligence provider in order to satisfy its obligations under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of
the Exchange Act, clarify the proposed definition of due diligence services, and make certain
technical modifications. 1476
As proposed, paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-10 provided that the written certification that a
person employed to provide third-party due diligence services is required to provide to an
NRSRO pursuant to section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act must be made on Form ABS Due
Diligence-15E. 1477 The Commission did not receive comments on paragraph (a) as proposed and
is adopting the paragraph with one technical modification. 1478 As adopted, the paragraph

services is required to provide to an NRSRO pursuant to section 15E(s)(4)(B) must be on Form

Paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed, provided that the written certification must be
signed by an individual who is duly authorized by the person providing the third-party due
diligence services to make such a certification. 1480 The proposed requirement was designed to
ensure that the person executing the certification on behalf of the provider of third-party due
diligence services has responsibilities that will make the person aware of the basis of the
information being provided in the form. 1481 The Commission did not receive comments on
paragraph (b) and is adopting the paragraph as proposed. 1482
As discussed above, the Commission did not receive comments specifically addressing
paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed. 1483 However, the Commission did receive
comments raising concerns about how a third-party due diligence provider can meet the
requirement in section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act, which – as discussed above – provides
that in any case in which third-party due diligence services are employed by an NRSRO, issuer,
or underwriter, the person providing the due diligence services shall provide, to any NRSRO that

produces a rating to which such services relate, written certification in a format as provided in
section 15E(s)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act. 1484
Commenters stated that the third-party due diligence provider or NRSRO may not know
the identities of the NRSROs producing credit ratings to which the due diligence services
relate. 1485 One of these commenters stated that the proposed requirements “unfairly place a
heavy burden on the third-party due diligence provider to determine which NRSRO is rating the
transaction” because this information “lies with the issuer.” 1486
The Commission anticipated this concern and, consequently, in the proposing release the
Commission asked a number of questions regarding how a third-party due diligence provider
could comply with section 15E(s)(4)(B) of Exchange Act and whether the Commission should
take steps to implement the statutory requirement. 1487 One of the potential approaches identified
by the Commission in the proposing release was to use the website referred to in paragraph
(a)(3)(iii) of Rule 17g-5 maintained by issuers, sponsors, or underwriters of structured finance
products (“Rule 17g-5 website”), as the mechanism for providing the written certification to all
NRSROs producing a credit rating to which the due diligence services relate. 1488

1488

See id. See also 17 CFR 240.17g-5(a)(3). Among other things, paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17g-5 requires an
NRSRO, among other things, to maintain on a password-protected Internet website a list of each structured
finance product for which it currently is in the process of determining an initial credit rating, and to provide
free and unlimited access to any NRSRO that, among other things, certifies it will access the website solely
for the purpose of determining and monitoring credit ratings. Paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of Rule 17g-5 requires
an NRSRO to obtain from the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the structured product a written
representation that can reasonably be relied upon that the arranger will, among other things, maintain on a
password-protected Internet website the information it provides to the NRSRO and will provide access to
the website to an NRSRO that, among other things, certifies it will access the website solely for the purpose
of determining and monitoring credit ratings.

386

Commenters responded that the Rule 17g-5 website would be an appropriate mechanism
to provide the certification to the NRSROs. 1489 One of these commenters stated that using the
Rule 17g-5 website would be “the most efficient way” to provide the certification and that it
would be a better approach than applying a “reasonableness test” in terms of assessing whether
the third-party due diligence provider submitted the certification to all NRSROs that are required
to receive the certification. 1490 Another commenter stated that the proposed requirements should
“accommodate situations” in which an NRSRO obtains the written certification indirectly from,
for example, a Rule 17g-5 website. 1491 An NRSRO stated that using the Rule 17g-5 websites as
a “delivery mechanism for the Rule 17g-10 certification” would ensure that “certifications are
supplied to all affected NRSROs at roughly the same time.” 1492
Another alternative suggested by the Commission was to establish a centralized database
administered by the Commission (such as the Commission’s EDGAR system) or by market
participants to be used for the purpose of providing the written certifications in accordance with
section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act. 1493 An NRSRO and another commenter stated that
creating a new centralized database or similar alternative for distributing the due diligence
certification would be costly. 1494

community to have the industry adopt a new system for distributing the Form ABS Due Diligence-15E
information nor do we believe it is cost-effective for such parties to have to utilize a for-profit centralized
database service for such purposes, especially in light of the amount of time and resources that have already
been directed to the development of the Rule 17g-5 system of distribution. And as we described above, the
Rule 17g-5 system more fairly allocates responsibility for dissemination of the information among the
issuer, underwriter and NRSRO.”); DBRS Letter (“Mandating the creation of a new centralized database or
any other costly alternative is not warranted under the circumstances.”).

387

Commenters suggested other alternatives. 1495 One commenter stated that the due
diligence provider should be required to deliver the certification “promptly upon receipt of a
written request from an NRSRO” for use by the NRSRO “in preparing its published report under
Rule 17g-7.” 1496 Another commenter stated that the party engaging the due diligence provider
should be required to obtain the certification from the service provider and that the service
provider should “be able to rely on the engaging party to transmit the form” to the required
NRSROs. 1497
In the proposing release, the Commission sought comment on how soon after it
completes its review the provider of third-party due diligence services should provide the written
certification to all NRSROs required to receive the certification, and the Commission provided
examples of potential timeframes (within twenty-four hours, two business days, or ten business
days). 1498 One commenter stated that the due diligence provider should be required to deliver the
certification “promptly upon receipt of a written request from an NRSRO.” 1499 Another
commenter suggested that the certification be provided five business days after the service
provider finishes reviewing the data in connection with its due diligence report. 1500 One NRSRO
stated that the certification should be provided “within two business days following completion
of the due diligence review” and added that “all required NRSROs should be in receipt of the

388

certification at the same time.” 1501 Another NRSRO stated that the certification should be
provided “within one business day after the service provider completes its review.” 1502
The Commission is persuaded that the final rule should provide a means for providers of
third-party due diligence services to be certain that they have met their obligation under section
15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act to provide Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to any NRSRO that
produces a credit rating to which the due diligence services relate. 1503 The Commission also is
persuaded that the most efficient means of providing certainty to the providers of third-party due
diligence services that they have met their obligations under section 15E(s)(4)(B) is to require
the third party to provide Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to any NRSRO that specifically
requests the form and to post the form on the Rule 17g-5 website maintained by the issuer,
sponsor, or underwriter of the Exchange Act-ABS. 1504
This will provide access to the form to an NRSRO that is producing a credit rating for the
Exchange Act-ABS but is unaware that the third party is conducting the due diligence services
because, for example, the NRSRO is using the Rule 17g-5 website to determine an unsolicited
credit rating. In addition, the third party will not be burdened with the task of trying to identify
every NRSRO that is producing a credit rating to which the due diligence services relate. For
these reasons, the Commission believes it is appropriate to modify Rule 17g-10 from the
proposal to add a “safe harbor” provision that incorporates the Rule 17g-5 websites.
1501

See S&P Letter.

1502

See DBRS Letter.

1503

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(s)(4)(B).

1504

See, e.g., DBRS Letter (“DBRS believes that the most efficient and cost-effective approach is to utilize
existing regulations as much as possible. As it stands today, issuers and underwriters who hire an NRSRO
to rate a structured finance product such as an Exchange Act-ABS are required to make available to other
NRSROs all information the issuer or underwriter ‘contracts with a third party to provide to’ the hired
NRSRO. Thus, if the issuer or underwriter contracts with a third-party service provider to supply a hired
NRSRO with a due diligence report, a copy of that report would already be made available to other
NRSROs pursuant to Rule 17g-5(a)(3).”).

389

Further, as discussed above, commenters suggested relatively short timeframes for
providing the written certification to the NRSROs producing a credit rating to which the due
diligence services relate. The Commission agrees that the written certification should be
provided soon after the provider of third-party due diligence services completes its review. As
discussed below, the certification will provide information that can be used by the NRSRO in
determining a credit rating for the Exchange Act-ABS. Consequently, the Commission believes
the certification should be provided to the appropriate NRSROs as soon as the third party
completes the review so that NRSROs can consider it in determining a credit rating for the
Exchange Act-ABS before the security is issued and purchased by investors. However,
prescribing a specific timeframe (such as within twenty-four hours or two days) may result in
situations – depending on the circumstances – where the certification could have been provided
sooner than required (for example, within minutes of it being finalized) or where practical issues
would prevent it from being submitted within the required timeframe. Therefore, the
Commission believes the “safe harbor” for the written certification should incorporate a
“promptly” standard.
For all the foregoing reasons, the Commission is establishing a “safe harbor” provision in
paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-10 pursuant to which a person employed to provide third-party due
diligence services will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of
the Exchange Act if the person promptly delivers an executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E
after completion of the due diligence services to: (1) an NRSRO that provided a written request
for the form prior to the completion of the due diligence services stating that the services relate
to a credit rating the NRSRO is producing; (2) an NRSRO that provides a written request for the
form after the completion of the due diligence services stating that the services relate to a credit

390

rating the NRSRO is producing; and (3) the issuer or underwriter of the asset-backed security for
which the due diligence services relate that maintains the Rule 17g-5 website with respect to the
asset-backed security. 1505 Consequently, the third-party provider of due diligence services can
fulfill its obligations under the statute by responding promptly to specific requests that Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E be delivered to a particular NRSRO and by promptly delivering the
form to the issuer or underwriter of the Exchange Act-ABS that maintains the Rule 17g-5
website. This establishes a process that can provide certainty to the third party that it has met its
obligation under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act.
The Commission is making a corresponding amendment to Rule 17g-5 that is designed to
provide for the prompt posting of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to the Rule 17g-5 website so
that other NRSROs can have access to it contemporaneously with an NRSRO that knew the third
party was performing due diligence and requested that the form be delivered upon completion of
the services. 1506 Specifically, the Commission is adding paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E) to Rule 17g-5 to
require that an NRSRO hired to rate a structured finance product must obtain an additional
representation that can reasonably be relied upon from the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the
product: namely, that the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter will post to the Rule 17g-5 website,
promptly after receipt, any executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E containing information about
the security delivered by a person employed to provide third-party due diligence services with
respect to the structured finance product. 1507

1505

See paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of Rule 17g-10.

1506

See, e.g., DBRS Letter (“By adding a note to paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) [of Rule 17g-5], the Commission
could confirm that where an issuer or underwriter contracts for the delivery of a due diligence report to the
hired NRSRO, the posted information must include the related Rule 17g-10 certification.”).

1507

See paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E) of Rule 17g-5. The Commission also is amending paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and
(a)(3)(iii)(A) of Rule 17g-5 to add references to new paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E).

391

Paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed, contained definitions of due diligence
services, issuer, originator, and securitizer for purposes of section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 17g-10. As proposed, paragraph (c)(1) defined the term due diligence services. 1508
Under the proposed definition, an entity would be deemed to have provided due diligence
services if it engaged in a review of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS for the purpose
of making findings with respect to any one of the five types of activities identified in proposed
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (v) of Rule 17g-10. 1509
Paragraph (c)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed, would identify the first category of due
diligence services as a review of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS for the purpose of
making findings with respect to the quality or integrity of the information or data about the assets
provided, directly or indirectly, by the securitizer or originator of the assets. 1510 Paragraph
(c)(1)(ii), as proposed, would identify the second category of due diligence services as a review
of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS for the purpose of making findings with respect
to whether the origination of the assets conformed to stated underwriting or credit extension
guidelines, standards, criteria, or other requirements. 1511 Paragraph (c)(1)(iii), as proposed,
would identify the third category of due diligence services as a review of the assets underlying an
Exchange Act-ABS for the purpose of making findings with respect to the value of collateral
securing such assets. 1512 Paragraph (c)(1)(iv), as proposed, would identify the fourth category of

due diligence services as a review of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS for the purpose
of making findings with respect to whether the originator of the assets complied with federal,
state, or local laws or regulations. 1513
Paragraph (c)(1)(v) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed, would identify the fifth category of due
diligence services – the catchall – as a review of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS for
the purpose of making findings with respect to any other factor or characteristic of such assets
that would be material to the likelihood that the issuer of the Exchange Act-ABS will pay interest
and principal according to its terms and conditions. 1514 The proposed catchall was intended to
apply to due diligence services used for pools of other asset classes (for example, commercial
loans, corporate loans, student loans, or credit card receivables) to the extent that providers of
third-party due diligence services currently provide or in the future begin providing due diligence
services with respect to other asset classes and those services, because of the different nature of
the assets, do not fall into one of the other four categories. 1515
Paragraph (c)(2), as proposed, defined the term issuer as including a sponsor, as defined
in 17 CFR 229.1011, or depositor, as defined in 17 CFR 229.1011, that participates in the
issuance of an Exchange Act-ABS. 1516 Paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4), as proposed, provided that

1516

See paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations,

to the depositor of an asset-backed security. See id. at 33467, n.532, 33473, n.594. This treatment is
consistent with the Commission’s historical regulatory approach to that term, including the Securities Act
and the rules promulgated under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. See, e.g., 17 CFR 230.191; 17
CFR 240.3b–19.

393

the terms originator and securitizer, respectively, have the same meanings as in section 15G of
the Exchange Act. 1517 Defining these two terms was intended to provide greater clarity as to the
proposed meaning of due diligence services. 1518
The definitions of due diligence services, issuer, originator, and securitizer in Rule 17g10, as adopted, are contained in paragraph (d) (rather than paragraph (c), as proposed) because of
the addition of the new “safe harbor” provision in paragraph (c) as discussed above. 1519 The
definitions are being adopted substantially as proposed with modifications, in part, in response to
comments. 1520
Commenters focused on the definition of due diligence services because the requirement
to provide the written certification under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act is triggered
when a third party is employed to provide these services with respect to an Exchange ActABS. 1521 A commenter that provides due diligence services recommended modifying the first
prong of the definition by replacing the phrase “quality and integrity” of the data with the word
“accuracy” because that would “more accurately reflects the role of the due diligence provider
1517

See paragraphs (c)(3) through (4) of Rule 17g-10, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33544. Section 15G(a)(4) of the Exchange Act defines the term originator to mean
“a person who—(A) through the extension of credit or otherwise, creates a financial asset that collateralizes
an asset-backed security; and (B) sells an asset directly or indirectly to a securitizer.” See 15 U.S.C. 78o9(a)(4). Section 15G(a)(3) of the Exchange Act defines the term securitizer to mean: “(A) an issuer of an
asset-backed security; or (B) a person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by
selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuer.” See
15 U.S.C. 78o-9(a)(3).

See paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of Rule 17g-10. In addition to the modifications discussed below, the
final rule is modified from the proposal in the following ways. First, the citation to the definition of assetbacked security in the Exchange Act is corrected in the prefatory text of paragraph (d) and in paragraphs
(d)(1) and (3). Second, the word “such” in third prong of the definition of due diligence services
(paragraph (d)(1)(iii)) has been replaced with the word “the”. Third, references in the definition of issuer in
paragraph (d)(2) have been corrected by replacing in two places the phrase “§ 229.1011” with the phrase “§
229.1101”. These modifications are not intended to substantively change the meaning of the terms as
compared to the proposed definitions.

and the nature of its objective review.” 1522 The Commission believes that this change will more
accurately describe the nature of the work undertaken by a provider of third-party due diligence
services, as suggested by the commenter. Consequently, the Commission is making the
modification. 1523
Commenters were concerned that the definition of due diligence services could be
interpreted to include services that have not traditionally been viewed as third-party due
diligence services. In this regard, several commenters focused on the fifth prong of the
definition: the catchall. 1524 As proposed, this prong included within the definition a review of
the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS for the purpose of making findings with respect to
any other factor or characteristic of such assets that would be material to the likelihood that the
issuer of the Exchange Act-ABS will pay interest and principal according to its terms and
conditions. 1525 Some commenters recommended eliminating this catchall provision. 1526 Two
commenters recommended it be narrowed. 1527 One of these commenters stated that the provision
should only include “factors or characteristics that were material to determining the credit
rating.” 1528 The other commenter stated that the provision should be limited to “factors that

1522

See Clayton Letter.

1523

See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-10. The commenter also recommended this modification be made to
Item 4 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, which used similar text to describe due diligence services. See
Clayton Letter. As discussed below in section II.H.3. of this release, the Commission is making a
corresponding modification to Item 4.

materially impact the likelihood that the assets themselves would pay interest and principal
according to their terms and conditions.” 1529
The Commission is not persuaded that the catchall provision should be eliminated. As
the Commission explained in the proposing release, the first four prongs of the definition were
based on the Commission’s understanding of the types of reviews undertaken with respect to the
pools of mortgage loans underlying issuances of RMBS because due diligence services
traditionally have been performed with respect to RMBS. 1530 The first four prongs also may
cover due diligence services performed with respect to other types of Exchange Act-ABS.
However, there also may be reviews now or in the future that are more tailored to the different
nature of the assets underlying these other types of Exchange Act-ABS. The proposed catchall
was designed to apply to due diligence services provided with respect to the assets (for example,
commercial loans, corporate loans, student loans, or credit card receivables) underlying other
types of Exchange Act-ABS to the extent not covered by the first four prongs of the definition.
For these reasons, the Commission believes it is appropriate to retain the catchall prong of the
definition and, therefore, is adopting it as proposed. 1531
One commenter stated that, if the catchall provision is not eliminated, “the final rule
should limit the provision’s application to other factors that materially impact the likelihood that
[the underlying] assets themselves would pay interest and principal according to their terms and
conditions” so that the “focus of the diligence services will be on the assets themselves, not the
issuer’s ability to pay as is set forth in the proposed definition.” 1532 The Commission agrees that

due diligence services typically focus on the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS. Indeed,
the prefatory text of paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17g-10 provides that the term due diligence
services means a review of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS for the purpose of
making findings with respect to certain matters. 1533 Moreover, the catchall provision includes
within the definition of due diligence services a review of any other factor or characteristic of the
assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS that would be material to the likelihood that the issuer
will pay interest and principal in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. 1534
Consequently, in response to the commenter, the Commission confirms that a review must be of
the assets underlying the Exchange Act-ABS in order to fall within the definition of due
diligence services. However, the performance of the underlying assets (for example, their ability
to pay principal and interest) ultimately will impact whether the Exchange Act-ABS itself will be
able to pay interest and principal because the payments received on the underlying assets are
passed through to the holders of the Exchange Act-ABS. Moreover, a review of the underlying
assets that is relevant to whether the Exchange Act-ABS will pay interest and principal according
to its terms is the type of information that would be useful to an NRSRO that is assessing the
creditworthiness of Exchange Act-ABS. The catchall provision is designed to account for such
reviews to the extent they are not addressed in the other prongs of the definition of due diligence
services. 1535

1533

See prefatory text of paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 17g-10.

1534

See paragraph (d)(1)(v) of Rule 17g-10.

1535

See id. One commenter suggested that the Commission clarify that the catchall definition of due diligence
services includes only the review of the assets in connection with the issuance of the asset-backed securities
as specifically requested by the issuer, underwriter, or NRSRO. See Clayton Letter. In response, the
Commission notes that the certification under Rule 17g-10 must be provided by the person who is
employed to provide third-party due diligence services. Accordingly, the catchall definition is not intended
to cover reviews that the third-party provider itself was not employed to perform by the issuer, underwriter,
or NRSRO.

397

While the catchall provision is not being eliminated, the definition of due diligence
services in Rule 17g-10 (including the catchall prong) is not intended to bring within the
definition’s scope activities that are performed today in connection with the issuance of an
Exchange Act-ABS that are not commonly understood as being third-party due diligence
services. Rather, it is designed to cover reviews of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS
that are commonly understood in the securitization market to be third-party due diligences
services. 1536 For example, it is not intended to cover every type of service that involves the
performance of diligence in the offering process. The catchall provision is designed to
incorporate within the definition reviews that are commonly understood in the securitization
market to be third-party due diligences services or analogous services that may develop in the
future but are not expressly covered by the first four prongs of the definition.
Several commenters argued that agreed-upon procedures engagements performed by
accounting firms should not be considered third-party due diligence services as contemplated by
section 15E(s)(4) of the Exchange Act. 1537 Some of these commenters suggested that the
proposed definition should apply only to reports that were prepared specifically with the intent to
provide those reports to an NRSRO or otherwise in connection with obtaining a credit rating. 1538

1536

Generally, third-party due diligence services have been performed with respect to RMBS. See Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33471. Generally, in the RMBS context, the
provider of third-party due diligence services is hired by the entity (for example, the underwriter, sponsor,
or depositor) purchasing the pool of mortgage loans for the purpose of securitizing them. In conducting a
review, the provider of third-party due diligence services analyzes a sample (for example, 25%) of the
loans in the pool for one or more of the following purposes: (1) to assess the quality of the loan-by-loan
data in the electronic file (“loan-tape”) that aggregates the information for the pool by comparing the
information on the loan tape for each loan in the sample with the information contained on the hard-copy
documents in the loan file; (2) to determine whether each loan in the sample adheres to the underwriting
guidelines of the loan originator; (3) to assess the validity of the appraised value of the property indicated
on the loan tape that collateralizes each loan in the sample; and (4) to determine whether the originator
complied with federal, state, and local laws in making each loan in the sample. Id.

398

Two of these commenters stated that accountants would be unlikely to perform any services that
could fall within the proposed definition. 1539 In support of the position to exclude agreed-upon
procedures engagements from the definition of due diligence services, commenters noted that
these engagements generally include one or more of the following: (1) comparing the loan tape
to the loan file; (2) recalculating projected future cash flows due to investors; and (3) performing
procedures that address other information included in the offering document. Commenters
argued that these procedures are performed primarily to assist issuers or underwriters in
verifying the accuracy of disclosures in registration statements and prospectuses.
The Commission agrees that the second and third examples performed as part of an
agreed-upon procedure engagement and for the purpose referenced are not commonly
understood as being due diligence services and should not trigger the requirements of section
15E(s)(4) of the Exchange Act. However, comparing the information on a loan tape with the
information contained on the hard-copy documents in a loan file is an activity that falls within
the definition of due diligence services in Rule 17g-10 because the work undertaken involves
reviewing of the accuracy of the information or data about the assets provided, directly or
indirectly, by the securitizer or originator of the assets. 1540 Consequently, the Commission is not
persuaded that it would be appropriate to exclude this type of review solely because it is being
performed in the context of an agreed-upon procedures engagement. As a result, comparing
information on a loan tape with information contained on the hard-copy documents in a loan file,

1539

See AICPA Letter; Ernst & Young Letter.

See paragraph (d)(1)(i) of Rule 17g-10. See also Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations,

contained on the hard-copy documents in the loan file…”).

even if performed under an agreed-upon procedure engagement, is a third-party due diligence
service under Rule 17g-10. 1541
The Commission understands there may be particular considerations that would need to
be taken into account under applicable professional standards that govern certain services
provided by the accounting profession. 1542 The requirements and limitations resulting from
relevant professional standards generally are described within the reports issued and, to the
extent such requirements or limitations are based upon professional standards, the Commission
would not object to the inclusion of the same description in the written certifications on Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E required under Rule 17g-10.
Commenters suggested that Form ABS Due Diligence-15E should be required to be
provided to NRSROs only at the time the Exchange Act-ABS is initially issued or rated. 1543 One
of these commenters stated that the due diligence provider’s obligations should “come to an end”
after providing the certification and suggested that for later rating actions, the NRSRO should be
permitted to “disclose that it is relying on” an earlier report. 1544 Another of these commenters
stated that the proposed requirements should be limited to services provided “prior to the
issuance of the ABS” and suggested that the certification be prepared on a “one-time basis per
report.” 1545 A third commenter stated that the certification should not “sunset” and instead
should be provided “for the life of the transaction/rated security.” 1546

The Commission recognizes that third-party due diligence services commonly are
performed prior to the issuance of an Exchange Act-ABS. Consequently, the Commission
expects most of the forms will be executed and provided at this time. However, if an NRSRO,
issuer, or underwriter employs a person to provide third-party due diligence services after the
issuance, the Commission believes that NRSROs monitoring the credit rating will benefit from
obtaining a Form ABS Due Diligence-15E relating to the due diligence services, as will investors
in the Exchange Act-ABS. Consequently, the Commission is not persuaded that it would be
appropriate to exempt post-issuance performance of due diligence services from the
requirements of section 15E(s)(4) of the Exchange Act.
One commenter recommended that the obligations of the third-party due diligence
provider should come to an end after the person provides the certification. 1547 As discussed
above, the Commission has added a “safe harbor” to Rule 17g-10 under which a provider of
third-party due diligence services can meet its obligations under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the
Exchange Act. 1548 In short, in order to be deemed to have satisfied those obligations, the
provider must promptly deliver an executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E after completion of
the due diligence services to each NRSRO that previously requested or that requests the form
and deliver the form to the issuer or underwriter that maintains the Rule 17g-5 website with
respect to the Exchange Act-ABS. At this point, the third party will have met its obligation
under section 15E(s)(4)(B) and Rule 17g-10. However, if the third party is employed by an
NRSRO, issuer, or underwriter to perform subsequent due diligence services with respect to the
Exchange Act-ABS, it will incur new obligations under section 15E(s)(4)(B) and Rule 17g-10.

See Deloitte Letter.

1548

See paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-10.

401

Commenters also sought clarification of the application of Rule 17g-10, as proposed, to
transactions or entities located outside the United States. 1549 After considering comments, as
discussed above in section II.G.1. of this release, the Commission has added an exemption in
paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 17g-7. The provision exempts an NRSRO from the disclosure
requirements upon taking a rating action, including the requirement that the NRSRO publish any
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E it receives or obtains from a Rule 17g-5 website, if the rating
action involves a rated obligor or issuer of the rated security that is not a U.S. person and if the
NRSRO has a reasonable basis to conclude that transactions in the securities issued by the
obligor or the issuer will be effected only outside the United States. 1550 Further, the Commission
has issued a temporary order exempting NRSROs from the Rule 17g-5 website requirements if
similar conditions are met. 1551 Consequently, if a person is employed by an NRSRO, issuer, or
underwriter to perform third-party due diligence services with respect to an Exchange Act-ABS
that is exempt from the Rule 17g-5 website provisions the person will not need to deliver an
executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to the issuer or underwriter of the Exchange Act-ABS to
meet the “safe harbor” requirement in paragraph (c)(3) of Rule 17g-10, as adopted. 1552 Instead,
the person only will need to promptly deliver an executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to any
NRSRO that requests it under paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2). 1553

New Form ABS Due Diligence-15E

Section 15E(s)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act provides that the Commission shall establish
the appropriate format and content for the written certifications required under section
15E(s)(4)(B), to ensure that providers of due diligence services have conducted a thorough
review of data, documentation, and other relevant information necessary for an NRSRO to
provide an accurate rating. 1554 The Commission proposed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to
implement section 15E(s)(4)(C). 1555 As proposed, the form contained five items and a signature
line with a corresponding representation. 1556
In the proposing release, the Commission sought comment on matters such as should
proposed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E be more prescriptive in terms of the steps a provider of
third-party due diligence services would need to take in performing the review. 1557 Commenters
stated that the proposed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E should not prescribe more requirements
regarding the due diligence review. 1558 Two NRSROs added that more prescriptive standards
may violate section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act, 1559 which prohibits the Commission from
regulating the substance of credit ratings. Another NRSRO stated that the proposed form should
“follow a more general approach” rather than prescribe minimum requirements for the thirdparty due diligence reviews. 1560

The Commission believes for now that the steps to be taken by a third party-due diligence
provider in reviewing the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS should be decided upon by
the party engaging the provider (most commonly the underwriter, sponsor, or depositor). As a
provider of third-party due diligence services noted in its comment letter, “[t]raditionally, our
services have been used by loan purchasers to make better decisions about how they price
portfolios and manage risk” and “[p]rospectively, we anticipate playing a valuable role by
independently validating the information used by market participants to make decisions relating
to loans being included in securitization transactions.” 1561 The Commission believes that the
parties engaging the services of third-party due diligence providers should have the flexibility to
prescribe the steps they believe are necessary to help them evaluate the assets underlying an
Exchange Act-ABS. Consequently, the form requires a provider of third-party due diligence
services to disclose information about its review of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS
but does not prescribe how the review must be conducted. For these reasons, the Commission,
as discussed below, is adopting Form ABS Due Diligence-15E substantially as proposed, with
modifications to the disclosure requirements in Items 3 and 4, a modification to the
representation requirement in the certification, and certain technical modifications. 1562 The
modifications do not substantively alter the form from the proposal.
As proposed, Item 1 of the form elicited the identity and address of the provider of thirdparty due diligence services. 1563 The Commission is adopting Item 1 as proposed. 1564 This Item
elicits the identity and address of the provider of third-party due diligence services.

404

As proposed, Item 2 of the form elicited the identity and address of the issuer,
underwriter, or NRSRO that employed the provider of third-party due diligence services. 1565
Those disclosures were intended to notify users of the certification of which third party
conducted the review described in the certification and which person employed the third party to
conduct the review, respectively. 1566
The Commission is adopting Item 2 with a technical, non-substantive modification from
the proposal. 1567 Commenters asked whether the form must be addressed to a specific
NRSRO. 1568 It does not. The form is a general certification. However, as discussed above in
section II.H.2. of this release, the provider of third-party due diligence services must deliver the
form promptly, to each NRSRO that requests it as well as to the issuer or underwriter that
maintains the Rule 17g-5 website with respect to the Exchange Act-ABS that is the subject of the
due diligence services, to be deemed to have met its obligation under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the
Exchange Act.
As proposed, Item 3 of the form provided that if the manner and scope of the due
diligence provided by the third party satisfied the criteria for due diligence published by an
NRSRO, the third party must identify the NRSRO and the title and date of the published criteria
in a table provided on the form. 1569 The proposed table and instructions would permit the
identification of more than one NRSRO, which would allow the third party to reflect in a single

1567

See Item 2 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. The modification adds the phrase “the third-party” before
the phrase “due diligence services.” As modified, Item 2 is consistent with Item 1, as proposed and

form that it conducted due diligence services in a manner that satisfied the due diligence
requirements of multiple NRSROs. 1570 The Commission is adopting Item 3 with one
modification to clarify the instruction for the Item in response to comments. 1571
Specifically, commenters raised concerns about what it would mean for the third party to
certify that it had satisfied the criteria for due diligence published by an NRSRO. 1572 For
example, one NRSRO stated that due diligence providers are “not in a position” to opine on
“whether the NRSRO’s criteria have been satisfied.” 1573 Another commenter stated that it
should be “up to the NRSRO to determine” whether the criteria were satisfied. 1574 A third
commenter stated that the disclosure should only be required where the due diligence provider is
expressly engaged to “comply with a particular set of NRSRO-published criteria.” 1575 A fourth
commenter – an NRSRO – stated that the disclosure requirement should be limited to criteria
published by the NRSRO involved in the engagement. 1576 Another NRSRO stated that it would
“continue to make its own assessment of whether its criteria are satisfied.” 1577
In response to the comments, the Commission notes that certain NRSROs, as part of the
rating criteria for RMBS, have specified the steps a person engaged to perform third-party due
diligence services must take in performing the services in order for them to rate the RMBS. 1578
For example, in the RMBS context, the provider of third-party due diligence services typically is

hired by the entity (for example, the underwriter, sponsor, or depositor) purchasing the pool of
mortgage loans for the purpose of securitizing them. In conducting a review, the provider of
third-party due diligence services typically analyzes a sample (for example, 25%) of the loans in
the pool for one or more of the following purposes: (1) to assess the quality of the loan-by-loan
data in the electronic file (“loan-tape”) that aggregates the information for the pool by comparing
the information on the loan tape for each loan in the sample with the information contained on
the hard-copy documents in the loan file; (2) to determine whether each loan in the sample
adheres to the underwriting guidelines of the loan originator; (3) to assess the validity of the
appraised value of the property indicated on the loan tape that collateralizes each loan in the
sample; and (4) to determine whether the originator complied with federal, state, and local laws
in making each loan in the sample. 1579 The NRSROs most active in rating RMBS have
incorporated requirements for the engagement of providers of third-party due diligence services
by the entities requesting such ratings (for example, the underwriter or sponsor of the RMBS)
into their procedures and methodologies for determining RMBS credit ratings. 1580 These
engagement requirements prescribe the minimum scope and manner of the review of the assets

See, e.g., Fitch, U.S. RMBS Originator Review and Third-Party Due Diligence Criteria (April 26, 2013)
(“Fitch expects third-party loan-level reviews to be performed on all residential mortgage pools where the
agency has been asked to assign ratings. The reviews should be conducted by independent due diligence
companies prior to the transaction closing.”); Moody’s, Moody’s Criteria for Evaluating Independent
Third-Party Loan Level Reviews for U.S. Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) (Sept. 22,
2009) (“Moody's will not rate a U.S. RMBS transaction unless there has been a [third-party loan level
review, (‘TPR’)] that at least meets our minimum sample size. If the minimum sample size is met, but the
sample size is still less than Moody's target sample size or if the TPR findings are poor, Moody's may
decide i) that more credit protection is needed to achieve a given rating level, ii) to assign a lower rating or
iii) to decline to rate the transaction…Moody's will not rate a transaction unless it has received a report
from the TPR firm as to the TPR scope, procedure and findings. The report must include a narrative
summary of the review and an initial TPR findings report before input from the TPR sponsor.”); S&P,

(“Standard & Poor's believes that using third-party due diligence results in its rating analysis will increase

underlying an RMBS that the provider of third-party due diligence services must conduct in
order for the NRSRO to determine a credit rating for the RMBS, including the minimum sample
size of the loans to be selected from the pool. 1581
Item 3 was designed to require the third party to record in the form that the third party
had endeavored to perform its due diligence in accordance with the due diligence criteria an
NRSRO had published. Further, by executing the form, the third party would certify that it had
performed the due diligence in accordance with the NRSRO’s criteria. 1582
The Commission acknowledges that certifying to having followed a given NRSRO’s due
diligence criteria does not establish that the third party in fact followed the criteria. However,
the objective of sections 15E(4)(B) and (C) of the Exchange Act is to require third-party due
diligence providers to provide a certification to NRSROs to “ensure” that the providers “have
conducted a thorough review of data, documentation, and other relevant information necessary
for [an NRSRO] to provide an accurate rating.” 1583 In the Commission’s view, if an NRSRO has
published criteria for performing due diligence reviews and the third party has sought to follow
the criteria, the form should provide a means for the third party to certify that it sought to follow
1581

For example, Fitch requires, at a minimum, a randomly selected minimum sample size to be the greater of
200 loans or 10% of the pool. See Fitch, U.S. RMBS Originator Review and Third-Party Due Diligence
Criteria. Moody’s defines its minimum sample size through statistical techniques. Specifically, Moody’s
requires that the sample size must not be less than that computed using a 95% confidence level, a 5%
precision level, and an assumed error rate equal to the higher of the historic error rate for the originator or a
Minimum Assumed Error Rate. See Moody’s, Moody’s Criteria for Evaluating Independent Third-Party
Loan Level Reviews for U.S. Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS). S&P requires a sample
that is the greater of either the number of loans needed for a statistically valid sample, or a 10% random
sample for subprime and 5% sample for prime. At a minimum, S&P states that the number of loans in the
sample should be 200 for subprime, and 100 for prime. S&P defines a statistically valid sample as the
number of loans based on a 5% one-tailed level of significance with a 2% level of precision. S&P expects
that the number of loans in the sample also will be a function of an estimate of an error rate. See S&P,
Incorporating Third-Party Due Diligence Results into the U.S. RMBS Rating Process.

the criteria. For these reasons, the Commission is adopting Item 3 to the form substantially as
proposed. However, in response to the comments, the Commission has modified the instruction
for Item 3 so that it contains the words “if the due diligence provided by the third party is
intended to satisfy” the criteria of an NRSRO. 1584
As proposed, Item 4 of the form required the provider of the third-party due diligence
services to describe the scope and manner of the due diligence services provided in connection
with the review of assets in sufficient detail to provide an understanding of the steps taken in
performing the review, including: (1) the type of assets that were reviewed; (2) the sample size
of the assets reviewed; (3) how the sample size was determined and, if applicable, computed; (4)
whether the quality or integrity of information or data about the assets provided, directly or
indirectly, by the securitizer or originator of the assets was reviewed and, if so, how the review
was conducted; (5) whether the origination of the assets conformed to, or deviated from, stated
underwriting or credit extension guidelines; (6) whether the value of collateral securing such
assets was reviewed and, if so, how the review was conducted; (7) whether the compliance of the
originator of the assets with federal, state, and local laws and regulations was reviewed and, if so,
how the review was conducted; and (8) any other type of review conducted with respect to the
assets. 1585 The proposed disclosure was intended to allow the NRSRO and users of credit ratings
to determine whether the provider of third-party due diligence services, based on its description,

See Item 3 to Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. As proposed, the instruction read, in pertinent part, “[i]f the
manner and scope of the due diligence provided by the third party satisfied” the criteria of an NRSRO. See

1585

See Item 4 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, as proposed; Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 76 FR at 33563. The proposed instructions would require the third party to provide this
description regardless of whether the third party represented in Item 3 of the form that its review satisfied
published criteria of an NRSRO. In other words, the third party would not be able to simply rely on a
cross-reference to the NRSRO’s published criteria to explain the work completed in performing the due
diligence.

Alternatively, if no criteria had been published for the type of Exchange Act-ABS or no claim to
satisfying criteria was made in Item 3, the proposed disclosure was intended to provide an
understanding of the due diligence performed. 1587 The instructions for Items 4, as proposed,
required the summary to be provided in an attachment to the Form, which would be considered
part of the form. 1588
The Commission is adopting Item 4 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E with
modifications, in part, in response to comments. 1589 Consistent with the modification to Item 3
discussed above, the Commission is modifying the last sentence of the instructions for the Item
to replace the phrase “satisfied the criteria for minimum due diligence” with the phrase “is
intended to satisfy the criteria for due diligence.” 1590 As adopted, Item 4 requires the third party
to provide a description of the scope and manner of the due diligence services provided in
connection with the review of assets that is sufficiently detailed to provide an understanding of
the steps taken in performing the review and to include in the description:
•

The type of assets that were reviewed;

•

The sample size of the assets reviewed;

•

How the sample size was determined and, if applicable, computed;

•

Whether the accuracy of information or data about the assets provided, directly or
indirectly, by the securitizer or originator of the assets was reviewed and, if so, how the
review was conducted; 1591

The Commission also removed the word “minimum” before the phrase “due diligence” in the last sentence
because it was unnecessary.

1591

As discussed above in section II.H.2. of this release, a commenter that provides due diligence services

•

Whether the conformity of the origination of the assets to stated underwriting or credit
extension guidelines, standards, criteria, or other requirements was reviewed and, if so,
how the review was conducted; 1592

•

Whether the value of collateral securing such assets was reviewed and, if so, how the
review was conducted;

•

Whether the compliance of the originator of the assets with federal, state, and local laws
and regulations was reviewed and, if so, how the review was conducted; and

•

Any other type of review that was part of the due diligence services conducted by the
person executing the Form. 1593
One commenter stated that the instruction that the description must be “sufficiently

detailed” to provide an understanding of the steps taken in performing the review should be
replaced with a standard that is not subjective. 1594 The Commission is not persuaded that this is
necessary. First, this instruction is consistent with the instructions for Exhibit 2 to Form
NRSRO, which has been in use since 2007. 1595 Second, by identifying the matters that must be

recommended modifying this description of due diligence services by replacing the phrase “quality and
integrity” of the data with the word “accuracy.” See Clayton Letter. The Commission believes that this
change will more accurately describe the nature of the work undertaken by a provider of third-party due
diligence services, as suggested by the commenter, and, therefore, has revised the instruction accordingly.
1592

As proposed, the phrase in the instruction stated “whether the origination of the assets conformed to stated
underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements was reviewed and, if
so, how the review was conducted.” See Item 4 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, as proposed; Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33472. The final instruction was modified to replace
the phrase “origination of the assets conformed” with the phrase “conformity of the origination of the
assets.” See Item 4 to Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. This modification is intended to provide a clearer
description of the category without substantively changing it.

1593

One commenter stated that the due diligence provider should only be required to describe “those of the
eight steps that relate to the services it actually performed” and suggested that the requirement to describe
“any other type of review conducted with respect to the assets” be omitted. See Deloitte Letter. The
instruction requires the third-party due diligence provider to describe only the reviews that the provider
conducted (that is, not reviews conducted by other service providers). The instruction has been modified to
clarify this point. Specifically, it now states “any other type of review that was part of the due diligence
services conducted by the person executing this Form” (emphasis added).

1594

See Clayton Letter.

1595

See instructions for Exhibit 2 to Form NRSRO (instructing, in pertinent part, that an applicant for
registration as an NRSRO or NRSRO submitting the form must provide in the Exhibit a general description
of the procedures and methodologies used by the applicant or NRSRO to determine credit ratings,
including unsolicited credit ratings within the classes of credit ratings for which the applicant or NRSRO is

411

included in the description, the instruction provides objective guidance on the topics that the
description must address. Another commenter suggested that examples of each of the categories
of information would be helpful. 1596 The discussion above provides some examples of the
matters that providers of third-party due diligence services review in the context of RMBS
issuances. As discussed above, Form ABS Due Diligence-15E is designed to account for due
diligence services provided with respect to other types of Exchange Act-ABS (in addition to
RMBS). Consequently, providing specific examples could create confusion if new types of
reviews tailored to non-RMBS Exchange Act-ABS develop in the future. The description of the
types of reviews in Item 4 provides detail on the matters that must be addressed in the form in a
way that is designed to provide guidance without narrowing the matters to the RMBS
context. 1597
As proposed, Item 5 of the form would require the provider of third-party due diligence
services to provide a summary of the findings and conclusions that resulted from the due
diligence services that is sufficiently detailed to provide an understanding of the findings and
conclusions that were conveyed to the person identified in Item 2 (that is, conveyed to the issuer,
underwriter, or NRSRO that employed the third party to perform due diligence services). 1598 As

seeking registration or is registered and that the description must be sufficiently detailed to provide users of
credit ratings with an understanding of the processes employed by the applicant or NRSRO in determining
credit ratings, including, as applicable, descriptions of a number of matters enumerated in the instructions)
(emphasis added).
1596

See Deloitte Letter.

1597

The descriptions in Item 4 correspond to the prongs of the definition of due diligence services in Rule 17g10. A provider of third-party due diligence services noted in its comment letter that the definition of due
diligence services in Rule 17g-10 (subject to certain modification suggested by the commenter) “captures
the scope of due diligence services provided to issuers or underwriters by third-party due diligence
providers in connection with the rating of an issuance of ABS…” See Clayton Letter. As discussed above
and in section II.H.2. of this release, this commenter suggested, among other things, that the phrase “quality
and integrity” of the data as used in the definition of due diligence services and in Item 4 should be
replaced with the word “accuracy.” Id.

Organizations, 76 FR at 33563.

412

with Item 4, the instructions for Items 5, as proposed, required the summary to be provided in an
attachment to the form, which would be considered part of the Form. 1599
The Commission is adopting Item 5 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E with a technical
non-substantive modification in response to comment. 1600 The Item provides that the person
providing due diligence services must provide a summary of the findings and conclusions that
resulted from the due diligence services that is sufficiently detailed to provide an understanding
of the findings and conclusions that were conveyed to the person that employed the third party to
perform the services. One commenter stated that the instruction regarding the summary be
“sufficiently detailed to provide an understanding of the findings and conclusions” should be
eliminated. 1601 The Commission is adopting the “sufficiently detailed” standard in this Item as it
is doing with respect to Item 4. 1602 As stated above, the standard is consistent with the
instructions for Exhibit 2 to Form NRSRO.
Finally, as proposed, the individual executing the form on behalf of a provider of thirdparty due diligence services would need to make two representations: (1) that he or she has
executed the form on behalf of, and on the authority of, the third party; and (2) that the third
party conducted a thorough review in performing the due diligence described in Item 4 and that
the information and statements contained in the form, including Items 4 and 5 attached to the
form, are accurate in all significant respects. 1603 The proposed representation was intended to

1599

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33563.

1600

See Item 5 of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. One commenter suggested that the word “description” in the
second sentence of the instruction be replaced with the word “summary.” See Clayton Letter. The
Commission agrees with this suggestion because Item 5 is titled “Summary of findings and conclusions of
review” and the first sentence of the instruction provides that the person executing the certification should
provide a “summary” of the findings and conclusions.

1601

See Clayton Letter.

implement section 15E(s)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act, which provides that the Commission shall
establish the appropriate format and content of the written certifications “to ensure that providers
of due diligence services have conducted a thorough review of data, documentation, and other
relevant information necessary for [an NRSRO] to provide an accurate rating.” 1604
The Commission is adopting the certification in Form ABS Due Diligence-15E with one
modification. Commenters stated that the certification should indicate that it is as of the date
signed. 1605 The Commission agrees. As adopted, the certification contains the representation
that the third-party due diligence provider conducted a thorough review in performing the due
diligence described in Item 4 of the form and that the information and statements contained in
the form, including Items 4 and 5 attached to the form, are accurate in all significant respects on
and as of the date hereof. 1606
One commenter stated that “professional standards as well as liability concerns would
prevent an accountant from stating that he or she has performed a ‘thorough review’ of
information because that term is undefined.” 1607 Another commenter stated that the words
“thorough review” should be replaced with “due care.” 1608 This commenter stated that, “[b]y
their very nature, due diligence procedures often relate to a sample, rather than the entire
population of assets, and in this sense the review may not be ‘thorough’ as to the scope of assets
reviewed and “the procedures themselves are limited in that choices were made to perform

certain procedures and not others.” 1609 This commenter also suggested that the phrase “accurate
in all significant respects” be omitted from the certification. 1610 Two commenters stated that the
phrase “accurate in all significant respects” should be changed to a “materiality” standard. 1611
One of these commenters also suggested that the certification should be “based on objective
standards that can be verified by the signer” and should state that the due diligence provider did
not conduct any reviews in addition to those expressly requested. 1612
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that, as stated in the proposing
release, including “thorough review” in the certification was designed to implement section
15E(s)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act, which provides that the Commission shall establish the
appropriate format and content of the written certifications “to ensure that providers of due
diligence services have conducted a thorough review of data, documentation, and other relevant
information necessary for [an NRSRO] to provide an accurate rating.” 1613 Further, this language
will provide some assurance to persons using the certification to evaluate the underlying assets
(including NRSROs determining credit ratings for the Exchange Act-ABS) that the third-party
due diligence provider undertook the review described in Item 4 in a thorough manner. Also, it
should create an incentive for a provider of third-party due diligence services to perform these
reviews in a competent manner because the third party must certify that the work was
thorough. 1614 In response to comment, the Commission notes that the provider of third-party due

As discussed above in section II.H.2. of this release, the Commission understands that in making the
certification there may be particular considerations that would need to be taken into account under
applicable professional standards that govern certain services provided by the accounting profession.

415

diligence services must certify that it “conducted a thorough review in performing the due
diligence described in Item 4 attached to [the] Form.” 1615 Consequently, the third party need
only certify that a “thorough review” was conducted with respect to the work actually performed
as specified in Item 4 of the form (for example, reviewing a sample of the assets). This limits the
scope of the certification to the matters reflected in Item 4. Consequently, in response to the
comment that the third-party due diligence provider should state that it did not conduct any
reviews in addition to those expressly requested, Item 4 will reflect the nature and scope of the
review work performed, which will be determined by the engagement.
Further, in response to comments, the Commission notes that the part of the certification
as to the accuracy of the information contained in the report is modeled on the certification
NRSROs must make on Form NRSRO. 1616 This has proven to be a workable attestation standard
as to the accuracy of information disclosed in a form since it was implemented in 2007. It also
provides an incentive for the person executing the form to take steps to verify that the
information contained in the form is accurate. In response to comments that the standard should
be changed to a materiality standard, the Commission notes that the “accurate in all significant
respects” is a standard that is intended to incorporate materiality. For all of these reasons, the
Commission is adopting the certification substantially as proposed.

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the specific amendments
and new rules related to disclosing information about third-party due diligence services. 1617 In

1616

See “Certification” on Form NRSRO.

1617

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may

416

particular, this section addresses the potential economic effects of Rule 15Ga-2 and Rule 17g-10
and the related amendments, including effects related to amended Form ABS-15G and new Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E, as well as effects of the amendments to Rule 17g-7 requiring that
NRSROs publish any written certifications received from third-party due diligence providers
when taking certain rating actions. 1618 The baseline that existed before today’s amendments and
new rules was one in which, under Rule 193, the issuer of any registered Exchange Act-ABS
offering was required to perform due diligence with respect to the assets underlying the
security. 1619 The issuer could conduct the review directly or engage one or more third-party
vendors to perform the review. Under Item 1111(a)(7) of Regulation AB, the nature as well as
the findings and conclusions of the review performed under Rule 193 was required to be
disclosed in the prospectus. 1620 These requirements applied whether or not the registered
Exchange Act-ABS would be rated by an NRSRO. Commission rules did not require that issuers
review assets or disclose to investors the nature, findings, and conclusions of any reviews in the
case of unregistered Exchange Act-ABS offerings, whether or not rated by an NRSRO.
Even in the case of registered offerings, information about the nature, findings, and
conclusions of all the third-party due diligence that was undertaken might not have been
disclosed under the existing rules. Rule 193 requires a review that provides reasonable assurance
that the disclosure in the prospectus regarding the assets is accurate in all material respects. The
rule requires that issuers disclose the nature of their review but does not require issuers to
disclose the specifics of each report where they have engaged third parties to perform multiple

derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today.
1618

The new requirements with respect to disclosing information about due diligence services are discussed in
sections II.G.5., II.H.1., II.H.2., and II.H.3. of this release.

1619

reviews and/or produce multiple reports, including interim reports, and does not require that the
issuer disclose the identity of the third party or third parties engaged to perform a review. Any
third party to which the findings and conclusions of the review disclosed in the prospectus are
attributed must be named as an expert in the prospectus, though the issuer is permitted to
attribute the findings and conclusions of the review to itself.
In the baseline, the issuer or underwriter of a rated Exchange Act-ABS, whether
registered or unregistered, typically provided some information about third-party due diligence
reports to any NRSROs they hired to rate the security. Further, some NRSROs, for certain asset
classes of Exchange Act-ABS, have adopted minimum standards for due diligence that are
required to be met in order for a security to be rated. For example, as discussed above, some
NRSROs, as a condition to rating an RMBS, require that a non-affiliated third party perform a
due diligence review of the assets underlying the RMBS. An NRSRO may also require that due
diligence reviews be performed in accordance with specified criteria, and/or that due diligence be
performed by one of a specified set of third-party due diligence providers that has been approved
by the NRSRO. Under the baseline requirements, any information about due diligence provided
by an issuer or underwriter to an NRSRO hired to rate an Exchange Act-ABS also was required
to be disclosed on a password-protected Rule 17g-5 website, which could be accessed by other
NRSROs that provided the required certification. 1621 However, the information transmitted by
issuers and underwriters to NRSROs was not subject to mandatory disclosure requirements, and
any disclosure may have involved editing or filtering by issuers or underwriters. 1622 In addition,

1621

See 17 CFR 240.17g-5.

http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=d5da9848-ea57475a-b6e9-93fc74b85abd (“Coffee Testimony II”) ( “An offering process for structured finance that was

issuers and underwriters who received multiple due diligence reports need not have provided
information about all of the reports to NRSROs. The Commission does not believe that
NRSROs typically hire third-party due diligence providers directly, but prior to the amendments
and new rules, information about third-party due diligence services employed directly by
NRSROs was not required to be disclosed to other NRSROs.
In addition to concerns about due diligence information potentially being withheld from
NRSROs, market participants, academics, and other observers have expressed concern about
decreased standards of due diligence in Exchange Act-ABS offerings. 1623 For example, it has
been reported that the percentage of loans in mortgage pools subject to review dropped from
30% to 5% from the year 2000 to 2005. 1624 Also, litigation in the wake of the financial crisis
alleged systemic abuses in due diligence practices with respect to asset-backed securities. 1625
Relative to the baseline, the amendments and new rules should benefit NRSROs, the
users of credit ratings, and investors and other Exchange Act-ABS market participants who may
or may not be users of credit ratings. NRSROs that are hired by the issuer or underwriter of any
Exchange Act-ABS to provide a credit rating, and any other NRSROs that are not hired but are
producing credit ratings related to the due diligence services, should benefit from receiving the
information in Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. Each Form ABS Due Diligence-15E will contain
important details about the third-party due diligence performed with respect to the Exchange
credible would look very different than the process we have recently observed. First, a key role would be
played by the due diligence firms, but their reports would not go only to the underwriter (who appears to
have at times ignored them). Instead, without editing or filtering, their reports would also go directly to the
credit rating agency.”).

Act-ABS to which the services relate, including a description of the scope and manner of the due
diligence services provided in connection with the review of the assets underlying the Exchange
Act-ABS and a summary of the findings and conclusions that resulted from the due diligence
services. The form will be signed by an individual who is duly authorized by the person
providing the third-party due diligence services to make such a certification, promoting
confidence in the accuracy of the content of the form. To the extent that there are any additional
due diligence reports obtained by an issuer or underwriter subject to Rule 15Ga-2 1626 that are not
related to credit ratings and therefore are not required to be disclosed to the NRSROs on Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E, NRSROs will also have access to the findings and conclusions of these
reports, via the Form ABS-15G required to be furnished at least five business days prior to the
first sale in the offering.
NRSROs may therefore receive information derived from additional reports of third-party
due diligence providers, and more detail about the third-party due diligence services, than they
would have obtained under the baseline requirements. Importantly, issuers and underwriters can
no longer select what part of this information to provide to NRSROs, reducing the possibility of
less favorable information being withheld from NRSROs. Having access to more complete data
may allow NRSROs to generate higher quality credit ratings, both in the case of solicited credit
ratings and in the case of unsolicited credit ratings by NRSROs. Non-hired NRSROs that choose
not to access the Rule 17g-5 websites because of the requirement to provide the annual
certification under paragraph (e) of the rule may benefit less from the amendments and new

1626

As discussed above, the Commission has excluded issuers and underwriters of municipal and certain
offshore offerings of Exchange Act-ABS from Rule 15Ga-2. Issuers and underwriters of municipal
Exchange Act-ABS remain subject to the statutory obligation under section 15E(s)(4)(A) to make publicly
available the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence reports they obtain, and could
choose to satisfy their obligation by voluntarily submitting Form ABS-15G on EMMA.

420

rules. 1627 Specifically, though these non-hired NRSROs can request Form ABS Due Diligence15E from the provider of third-party due diligence services, they will not be able to request this
form until they become aware of a given offering and which third-party has provided services
related to that offering, and so they may not have the required information to provide unsolicited
credit ratings in as timely a manner as NRSROs that do have access to these websites. However,
prior to today’s amendments and new rules, non-hired NRSROs that did not have access to the
Rule 17g-5 websites were already disadvantaged in providing unsolicited credit ratings given
that they likely lacked timely access to other information about the Exchange Act-ABS.
Users of credit ratings, as well as investors and other market participants who may or
may not be users of credit ratings, may also benefit from the Form ABS-15G and Form ABS Due
Diligence-15E disclosures, particularly in cases where information that was not previously
disclosed to these persons becomes available as a consequence of the amendments and new
rules. As noted above, the findings and conclusions of all third-party due diligence reports
obtained by issuers and underwriters of rated Exchange Act-ABS will be made public through
disclosures on Form ABS-15G, except in the case of municipal Exchange Act-ABS for which
the issuer or underwriter chooses to make such information publicly available through some
other means and in the case of certain offshore transactions. 1628 In the case of registered rated

1627

See 17 CFR 240.17g-5(e) (requiring, among other things, that the NRSRO certify that it will determine and
maintain credit ratings for at least 10% of the issued securities and money market instruments for which it
accesses information pursuant to the rule, if it accesses such information for ten or more issued securities or
money market instruments in the calendar year covered by the certification).

1628

As discussed above, in light of the practical and legal considerations raised by commenters, the
Commission adopted revisions to the proposal to provide that Rule 15Ga-2, as well as section 15E(s)(4)(A),
will not apply to certain offshore offerings of Exchange Act-ABS. The criteria for exemption include,
among other things, that the security issued will be offered and sold upon issuance, and that any
underwriter or arranger linked to the security will effect transactions of the security after issuance, only in
transactions that occur outside the United States. It is therefore possible that the rule may result in foreign
issuers seeking to avoid the disclosure requirement by limiting certain offerings of Exchange Act-ABS to
transactions outside the United States, thus potentially depriving U.S. investors of diversification and
related investment opportunities.

421

Exchange Act-ABS, the Form ABS-15G disclosures may include findings and conclusions of
reports (for example, interim reports) other than the report(s) supporting the results reported in
the prospectus under Rule 193 and Item 1111(a)(7) of Regulation AB. Consequently,
information that would not have been available to the public under the baseline requirements
may now be disclosed publicly. In the case of unregistered rated Exchange Act-ABS, because
Rule 193 and Item 1111(a)(7) of Regulation AB do not apply to such offerings, all of the
information about the findings and conclusions of third-party due diligence reports disclosed in
Forms ABS-15G should be information that may not have been available to potential investors,
and would not have been disclosed to the broader public, under the baseline requirements.
In addition, any disclosures on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E will be published by
NRSROs with their credit ratings when taking rating actions covered by Rule 17g-7 with respect
to the Exchange Act-ABS. The Forms ABS Due Diligence-15E will contain additional detailed
information about third-party due diligence with respect to an Exchange Act-ABS for which the
NRSRO is producing a credit rating beyond the findings and conclusions that must be disclosed
by issuers and underwriters, including a description of the scope and manner of the due diligence
services provided in connection with the review of the assets underlying an Exchange Act-ABS.
In the case of any review that is also discussed in the prospectus pursuant to Rule 193, the
description of such review disclosed in Form ABS Due Diligence-15E may include information
that is not already disclosed as part of the “nature of the review” discussed in the prospectus.
Also, Form ABS Due Diligence-15E information with respect to any due diligence services
employed by an NRSRO rating the security will also be published together with each NRSRO’s
credit rating, for credit rating actions subject to Rule 17g-7.

422

In particular, in the case of registered and certain unregistered Exchange Act-ABS with
issuer-paid credit ratings, any disclosures on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E will be made
publicly available by the issuer-paid NRSRO pursuant to Rule 17g-7, perhaps, for example, on
its corporate Internet website. However, if Exchange Act-ABS, whether registered or
unregistered, is rated only by subscriber-paid NRSROs, then the Form ABS Due Diligence-15E
information is only required by Rule 17g-7 to be made available to subscribers of these
NRSROs. Finally, a commenter indicated that in some unregistered offerings of Exchange ActABS, credit ratings are distributed only to potential investors in the offering. 1629 Because Rule
17g-7 requires that Forms ABS Due Diligence-15E are made available to the same persons who
can receive or access the credit rating, the information in these forms about the scope and
manner of the due diligence services provided in connection with the review of assets may then
only be made available to these potential investors.
In the above cases in which, relative to the baseline, new information becomes available
to users of credit ratings and investors and other market participants who may or may not be
users of credit ratings, many of these persons should benefit from the information. The
information on the findings and conclusions of reviews disclosed using Form ABS-15G may be
of particular use in understanding the quality of the asset pool underlying the Exchange ActABS, and possibly may represent a more balanced view of such quality than would have been
provided in the absence of the amendments and new rules, since the findings and conclusions of
all reviews obtained by issuers and underwriters must be reported. The information from Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E may be of particular use in determining the adequacy and the level of
due diligence services provided by the third parties. The information in both forms may be of

1629

See DBRS Letter.

423

use to users of credit ratings and investors and market participants who may or may not be users
of credit ratings in evaluating rated Exchange Act-ABS, both in isolation and in comparison to
other rated Exchange Act-ABS. The additional information available relative to the baseline –
because it provides insights into the quality of the asset pool and the due diligence procedures of
the parties involved – also may help these persons in evaluating the NRSROs, issuers and
underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS, third-party due diligence providers, and other parties
involved in the issuance process. Consequently, the additional information may be of use in
current and future investment decisions as well as other interactions among the various parties
involved. The benefits of this information may be constrained, however, by the fact that Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E disclosures for different securities which may be rated by different
NRSROs are not consolidated in a single location, potentially increasing the effort required to
collect and compare these disclosures.
Users of credit ratings and investors and other market participants who may or may not
be users of credit ratings may also benefit from other effects of the adopted rules. To the extent
that NRSROs obtain more complete information about Exchange Act-ABS that they rate, users
of credit ratings may benefit from the higher quality credit ratings that may result. The new
information available to investors and other market participants, together with these higher
quality credit ratings, may result in more informed investment decisions – potentially improving
individual portfolio efficiency as well as market efficiency – and may benefit capital formation
by encouraging more participation in the Exchange Act-ABS market. Also, the detailed
disclosures and the accompanying certification requirements may promote greater rigor and
discipline of due diligence procedures and thus benefit investors and other market participants
who may or may not be users of credit ratings. In particular, the detailed disclosures and the

424

identification of the third parties involved may enhance the ability of third-party due diligence
providers to form a market reputation for providing thorough and accurate due diligence reviews,
increasing the competition among these third parties on the basis of quality. In addition, the
increased comparability of the quality of due diligence across transactions may enhance
competition among issuers. 1630
Relative to the baseline, the amendments and new rules will result in compliance costs to
issuers and underwriters in offerings of Exchange Act-ABS, third-party due diligence providers,
and NRSROs. Rule 15Ga-2 will result in costs to issuers and underwriters in offerings of rated
Exchange Act-ABS, whether registered or unregistered (other than municipal Exchange ActABS and certain offshore Exchange Act-ABS). Although they are excluded from Rule 15Ga-2,
issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS will still incur costs to comply with
their statutory disclosure obligation under section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act, and the
Commission has estimated costs to these issuers and underwriters based on the assumption that
they will satisfy the disclosure obligation by furnishing Form ABS-15G on EMMA. 1631 The
Commission believes that the entities that will furnish Form ABS-15G pursuant to Rule 15Ga-2
and/or section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act generally will already have processes and
protocols in place to file Form ABS-15G in order to disclose repurchase activity as required by
Rule 15Ga-1. 1632 However, they will bear any costs of adapting their current processes and

1630

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

1631

To the extent that issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS use another means to make the
required information publicly available, such as through an Internet website, the compliance costs to these
parties could be greater or less than the Commission’s estimates, depending on the method chosen to
disclose the information.

1632

As discussed above, the Commission has revised the final rule to clarify that a single Form ABS-15G may
be furnished when the issuer and/or one or more underwriters have obtained the same third-party due
diligence report. The Commission thus expects that the securitizer responsible for filing Rule 15Ga-1
disclosures on Form ABS-15G will most likely also file the Rule 15Ga-2 disclosures.

425

protocols to provide the information required to comply with the new disclosure requirements,
including modifying their existing Form ABS-15G processes and protocols to accommodate
these requirements. They also will incur ongoing costs to prepare and furnish Form ABS-15G to
the Commission through EDGAR or, in the case of municipal Exchange Act-ABS, potentially
through EMMA. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that
Rule 15Ga-2 and the amendments to Form ABS-15G will result in total industry-wide one-time
costs to issuers and underwriters of approximately $9,509,000 and total industry-wide annual
costs to issuers and underwriters of approximately $202,000. 1633
Rule 17g-10 will result in one-time and recurring costs for providers of third-party due
diligence services. Initially, they will need to develop processes and protocols for preparing the
information required, certifying, and promptly delivering Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to
NRSROs and to issuers and underwriters maintaining Rule 17g-5 websites. They also may
engage outside counsel, and/or consult with in-house counsel, to advise them on how to comply
with the new requirements. Providers of third-party due diligence services also will bear
recurring costs. Each time they are employed by an issuer, underwriter, or NRSRO to perform
due diligence services, they will need to prepare and execute the Form. Based on analysis for
purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence15E will result in total industry-wide one-time costs to third-party due diligence providers of
approximately $1,405,000 and total industry-wide annual costs of approximately $67,000. 1634
Third-party due diligence providers and the individuals executing the forms on behalf of the third

parties may also bear the risk of future liability and associated costs due to the certification
requirements in the rule.
The amendments and new rules related to Form ABS Due Diligence-15E also will result
in one-time costs for NRSROs to amend their standard agreement forms with issuers and
underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS to include the new representation required under Rule 17g-5.
Further, the amendments and new rules will result in recurring costs for issuers and underwriters
to promptly post the form on their Rule 17g-5 websites. Based on analysis for purposes of the
PRA, the Commission estimates that these compliance efforts will result in total industry-wide
costs of approximately $1,902,000 in one-time costs to NRSROs and approximately $34,000 in
annual costs to issuers and underwriters. 1635 NRSRO compliance costs with respect to attaching
Forms ABS Due Diligence-15E to the forms that they must publish when taking certain credit
rating actions are addressed above in section II.G.6. of this release.
Rule 17g-10 and the associated amendments may also lead to other costs. One
commenter stated that it “remains possible that certain third-party due diligence providers may
refuse to provide these certifications” or “it may make it more difficult for certain relatively
smaller transactions to come to market, since third-party due diligence providers may only be
willing to provide these certifications for the largest of transactions, where fees are at levels high
enough to justify the associated costs and legal risks.” 1636 The Commission acknowledges that
the required certification by third-party due diligence providers may increase the litigation risk
and liability of these providers, particularly for those third party providers that do not already
bear expert liability under Rule 193. The required certification therefore may increase the fees
1635

See section V.J. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). These
costs are derived by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs identified in the PRA
analysis in section IV.D.5. of this release.

427

charged by these providers – which may be borne by issuers, underwriters, or investors – and
may diminish competition by reducing the number of providers who are willing to provide due
diligence in these offerings. These effects could impact capital formation, in that it may be more
costly or difficult to issue Exchange Act-ABS to the extent that the performance of third-party
due diligence services is necessary to bring these securities to market. Also, though the
Commission believes that NRSROs have not generally employed third-party due diligence
services, the disclosures related to any third-party due diligence services employed by NRSROs
may reduce any incentives NRSROs have to employ such services, given that the details about,
and the results of, such due diligence will be disclosed to competing NRSROs. 1637
Together, all of the adopted rules regarding third-party due diligence services may result
in additional costs. The required disclosures may be detrimental to capital formation by delaying
market access by issuers. 1638 There also may be other costs to investors and other market
participants. The disclosure requirements with respect to any third-party due diligence report
obtained may incentivize issuers and underwriters to decrease the number and scope of due
diligence reviews undertaken in order to decrease the likelihood that they reveal problems that
would have to be disclosed to market participants. If fewer or more limited reviews are
undertaken, the information available directly or indirectly (such as through credit ratings) to
investors and other market participants may ultimately be reduced. Alternatively, the required
disclosures with respect to third-party due diligence reports may cause issuers and underwriters
to undertake their own due diligence internally or via related subsidiaries, rather than by
employing third parties, in order to avoid making the required disclosure or because third-party

amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

1638

428

due diligence providers increase their fees or become unwilling to provide these services. These
potential changes in issuer and underwriter behavior could result in a reduced quality of due
diligence undertaken with respect to Exchange Act-ABS because of the lack of independent
reviews. The possibility of less comprehensive or less independent due diligence being
undertaken may be mitigated by market pressures because, as noted above, some NRSROs
require that due diligence be undertaken by an independent third party and that this due diligence
meet certain criteria before they will produce a credit rating for certain types of Exchange ActABS. Also, if no Form ABS-15G disclosure is made, investors will be put on notice that the
issuer or underwriter did not employ a provider of third-party due diligence services in
connection with the offering of an Exchange Act-ABS, and thus these investors may be less
likely to participate in the offering or may demand a lower offering price.
The Commission has considered the costs and benefits of reasonable alternatives relative
to the amendments and new rules, including certain alternatives that have been raised by
commenters and discussed above. As noted above, the Commission considered alternative
approaches to the required timing of the disclosures, namely a greater or fewer number of days
before the first sale in an offering by which Forms ABS-15G must be furnished or a more
explicit requirement than the “promptly” standard governing the provision of Form ABS Due
Diligence-15E. 1639 If Forms ABS-15G are furnished closer in time to the first sale in an offering,
the informational benefits of the disclosures may be reduced, because NRSROs and market
participants may not have enough time to thoroughly and accurately analyze the included
information before investment or credit rating decisions are made. However, the longer the
delay between the required furnishing of Forms ABS-15G and the first sale in the offering, the

1639

See sections II.H.1. and II.H.3. of this release.

429

more of an impediment the requirement may be to prompt market access by issuers and
underwriters. The Commission believes it has appropriately balanced these considerations in
requiring that Forms ABS-15G be furnished five business days prior to the first sale in the
offering. In the case of Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, it is possible that prescribing a required
timeframe for provision of the form could provide more assurance that NRSROs are able to
thoroughly review the information and incorporate it into their credit ratings. However, an
explicit timeframe does not seem appropriate given the variation and uncertainty in how quickly
the disclosures will be able to be provided in practice.
The Commission also considered whether, as suggested by a commenter, 1640 only
information about final due diligence reports should have to be disclosed on Form ABS-15G.
Limiting the disclosure requirement to final reports may reduce compliance costs to issuers and
underwriters. However, as discussed above, the Commission believes that NRSROs, users of
credit ratings, and investors and market participants who may or may not be users of credit
ratings should benefit from the information derived from interim as well as final due diligence
reports. 1641 In particular, requiring that all reports, including interim reports, received by issuers
or underwriters be disclosed further limits the possibility that issuers and underwriters can
prevent less favorable information from being revealed (for example, by requesting a change in
the due diligence methodology or hiring a different third party due diligence provider after
viewing a less favorable interim report).
Another alternative would be to require NRSROs to publish each Form ABS Due
Diligence-15E on EDGAR and allow them to incorporate the forms by reference when
publishing a related credit rating. This approach would, in some cases, increase the persons that
1640

See Clayton Letter.

1641

See section II.H.1. of this release.

430

have access to the information in the form. Also, it may increase the benefits of the disclosure
by including all third-party due diligence disclosures in a consolidated location, rather than a
combination of EDGAR (with respect to Form ABS-15G information) and each of the various
means by which each NRSRO publishes their ratings (with respect to Form ABS Due Diligence15E information). However, this approach would increase the total compliance costs borne by
NRSROs.

STANDARDS OF TRAINING, EXPERIENCE, AND COMPETENCE

Section 936 of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Commission shall issue rules that
are reasonably designed to ensure that any person employed by an NRSRO to perform credit
ratings: (1) meets standards of training, experience, and competence necessary to produce
accurate ratings for the categories of issuers whose securities the person rates; and (2) is tested
for knowledge of the credit rating process. 1642 The Commission proposed new Rule 17g-9 and
adding paragraph (b)(15) to Rule 17g-2 to implement section 936 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1643
1.

New Rule 17g-9

Rule 17g-9, as proposed, had three paragraphs: (a), (b) and (c). 1644 Paragraph (a), as
proposed, contained a requirement that an NRSRO design and administer standards of training,
experience, and competence. 1645 Paragraph (b), as proposed, identified factors an NRSRO would

1642

Public Law 111-203, 936. A related provision, section 939E of the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the GAO to
conduct a study on the feasibility and merits of creating an independent professional organization for rating
analysts employed by NRSROs that would be responsible for: (1) establishing independent standards for
governing the profession of rating analysts; (2) establishing a code of ethical conduct; and (3) overseeing
the profession of rating analysts. A report on the results of the study must be submitted to Congress not
later than one year after the publication of Commission rules pursuant to section 936 of the Dodd-Frank
Act. Public Law 111-203, 939E. In this regard, a commenter stated that it “looks forward to a robust
discussion on the merits and feasibility of creating an independent professional organization for ratings
analysts once the [GAO] issues its report on the matter.” See AFSCME Letter.

need to consider in designing the standards. 1646 Paragraph (c), as proposed, set forth two
requirements – one relating to periodic testing and the other relating to minimum experience –
that an NRSRO would need to incorporate into the standards. 1647 The Commission is adopting
Rule 17g-9 substantially as proposed but with modifications in response to comments. 1648
As discussed below, some commenters raised concerns that the proposed rule provided
too much flexibility to an NRSRO to design its standards of training, experience, and
competence. The Commission intended the proposed rule to provide flexibility because, among
other reasons, the NRSROs vary significantly in the size and the scope of their activities. The
Commission reiterates its view, as stated in the proposing release, that the standards established
by an NRSRO with more than a thousand credit analysts and that produces tens of thousands of
credit ratings across a wide range of asset classes may need to be different from the standards of
an NRSRO with fewer than ten credit analysts and that focuses on a particular class of credit
ratings. 1649 Moreover, the rating methodologies used by NRSROs and potential NRSRO
applicants to determine credit ratings may vary significantly. For these and other reasons, as
discussed below, Rule 17g-9, as adopted, provides flexibility to NRSROs to customize their
standards, provided they consider the factors in proposed paragraph (b) and incorporate the
standards required under proposed paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-9.
As proposed, paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-9 provided that an NRSRO must establish,
maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for the
individuals it employs to determine credit ratings that are reasonably designed to achieve the

432

objective that such individuals produce accurate credit ratings in the classes and subclasses of
credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 1650 Under the proposal, an NRSRO would be
permitted to design standards for its credit analysts that are customized to its size, business
model, and procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings, which vary widely
across NRSROs. 1651 At the same time, the proposed rule specified an objective for the standards
which was consistent with section 936 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1652 In particular, the standards
needed to be reasonably designed to achieve the objective that the individuals employed by the
NRSRO to determine credit ratings produce accurate credit ratings in the classes and subclasses
of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 1653
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-9 substantially as proposed but
with modifications in response to comments. 1654 As adopted, the paragraph provides that an
NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and
competence for the individuals it employs to participate in the determination of credit ratings that
are reasonably designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produces accurate credit
ratings in the classes of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 1655
Commenters addressed paragraph (a), as proposed. 1656 Several commenters stated that in
general it was not appropriate to permit NRSROs to design their own credit analyst training and

testing programs and that, for example, the Commission or a private certification program should
provide standards and requirements. 1657 One commenter stated that “the Commission should
provide a set of minimum standards” and that the standards “should include individual sector
experience, minimum education such as an MBA, and certifications such as a CFA, which
includes a strong ethics standard.” 1658 A second commenter stated that “[t]he standards must
include a system for periodically reviewing ratings for ‘accuracy,’ specifically for the purpose of
adjusting” the standards for credit analysts based on the results of such reviews. 1659 A third
commenter stated that the Commission should prescribe the minimum content for training, to
include topics such as ethics, conflicts of interest, and regulations on the ratings process, as well
as the proper development of methodologies. 1660
On the other hand, several NRSROs stated that it was appropriate that the rule provide
flexibility to NRSROs in designing the standards required under the proposed rule. 1661 One
NRSRO stated that credit rating agencies “come in many shapes and sizes and they determine
credit ratings in many different ways” and, therefore, “[i]mposing prescriptive analyst standards
on such a diverse group would diminish the value of the rule.” 1662
In response to comments that NRSROs should not have flexibility to design their own
standards and that the rule should prescribe specific requirements, the Commission believes at
this time, as discussed above, that the proposed approach achieves an appropriate balance
between prescribing objectives, factors that must be considered, and specific standards that must

be included and allowing NRSROs to tailor the standards to their business models, size, and
rating methodologies, which vary significantly across NRSROs and potential NRSRO applicants.
For example, prescribing minimum education requirements (such as an MBA) and certification
requirements (such as a CFA) – as suggested by one commenter – may not be appropriate for all
NRSROs because, for example, it could disqualify an analyst that has substantial experience in
conducting credit analysis but does not have the requisite degree or certification. 1663 Further,
this could burden smaller NRSROs to the extent they would need to hire new analysts to meet
the requirements or need to pay for their analysts to obtain the necessary degrees or
certifications.
An NRSRO stated that “as forward-looking statements of opinion, ratings should not be
categorized as ‘accurate’ or ‘inaccurate’” and that the Commission should instead focus on
whether the ratings have been derived in a manner consistent with the NRSRO’s policies and
procedures. 1664 In response, the Commission re-iterates that section 936 of the Dodd-Frank Act
requires the Commission to issue rules that are reasonably designed to ensure that any person
employed by an NRSRO to perform credit ratings meets standards of training, experience, and
competence necessary to produce “accurate” credit ratings for the categories of issuers whose
securities the person rates. 1665 Paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-9, as proposed and adopted,
implements this requirement by providing that the standards must be reasonably designed to
achieve the objective of producing accurate credit ratings. 1666 The Commission acknowledges
that there is no consensus as to whether or how credit ratings can be measured for accuracy. 1667

435

The Commission also recognizes that the credit rating assigned to an obligor or obligation today
may need to be revised in the future if circumstances change and that even the most creditworthy
obligors or obligations may default. Consequently, for the purposes of Rule 17g-9, as adopted,
an “accurate” credit rating does not mean a credit rating that once issued will never need to be
upgraded or downgraded or classified as a default. Instead, to be accurate under the rule, the
credit rating should be a credible assessment of the relative creditworthiness of an obligor or
obligation. 1668 To be a credible assessment at the time of issuance, the credit rating, among other
things, should be determined in accordance with the applicable rating methodology of the
NRSRO; take into account all relevant information as specified by the rating methodology; not
be influenced by conflicts of interest; be based solely upon the merits of the obligor, security, or
money market instrument being rated; and be an independent evaluation of the credit risk and
merits of the obligor, security, or money market instrument. 1669 Historical performance statistics
can play a role in evaluating whether an NRSRO’s credit ratings over time are providing credible
assessments of the relative creditworthiness of obligors and obligations.
An NRSRO suggested that NRSROs should not be required to comply with Rule 17g-9
“to the extent the NRSRO reasonably believes it is prohibited by applicable law or binding

1668

See id. at 14-21 (describing credit rating symbols and their definitions).

1669

See, e.g., section 15E(q)(2)(F) of the Exchange Act (providing that the Commission’s rules must require an
NRSRO to include an attestation with any credit rating it issues affirming that no part of the rating was
influenced by any other business activities, that the rating was based solely on the merits of the instruments
being rated, and that such rating was an independent evaluation of the risks and merits of the instrument).
As discussed above in section II.G.4. of this release, the Commission is implementing section 15E(q)(2)(F)
through paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7, as adopted. This paragraph, as adopted, provides that the
NRSRO must attach to the form accompanying a credit rating a signed statement by a person within the
NRSRO stating that the person has responsibility for the rating action and, to the best knowledge of the
person: (1) no part of the credit rating was influenced by any other business activities; (2) the credit rating
was based solely upon the merits of the obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated; and (3)
the credit rating was an independent evaluation of the credit risk of the obligor, security, or money market
instrument.

436

agreements in the relevant jurisdiction from doing so.” 1670 In response, the Commission notes
that the rule as adopted gives NRSROs the flexibility to design their standards of training and
testing for credit analysts. Consequently, an NRSRO can tailor its standards to accommodate
local laws. These standards, must, however, meet the requirements of Rule 17g-9. The
Commission does not believe a blanket exemption would be appropriate, but if laws or binding
agreements in certain jurisdictions prohibit the NRSRO from complying with certain provisions
of Rule 17g-9, the NRSRO can seek appropriate targeted relief.
Finally, one NRSRO suggested that the words “and subclasses” be removed from
paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 17g-9 because “NRSROs are registered only for various credit
rating classes; there is no subclass registration.” 1671 A second NRSRO stated that it determines
“credit ratings by committee and no one individual is responsible for any credit rating.” 1672
Another commenter stated that “[i]ndividuals do not ‘produce…credit ratings,’ accurate or
otherwise.” 1673
While the use of the term “subclasses” was designed to account for the different types of
obligors and obligations assigned credit ratings within a class of credit ratings, the Commission
agrees with the comment that the use of the term in paragraph (a) was potentially confusing
because NRSROs do not register in subclasses of credit ratings. 1674 Accordingly, the
Commission has modified proposed paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-9 to remove the reference to

1670

See Moody’s Letter (“[I]in some jurisdictions it might not be possible to require an existing employee to
meet new competence, experience, training, or testing requirements unless he or she agrees to such
requirements in an amended employment agreement or collective bargaining agreement. If the employee,
union or works council declines to sign the amended agreement, it might not be possible for the NRSRO to
modify unilaterally the employment relationship.”).

“subclasses,” and paragraph (a) as adopted refers only to “the classes of credit ratings” for which
the NRSRO is registered. 1675 In response to comments that individuals generally do not
“determine” credit ratings (the language in the proposed rule), 1676 paragraph (a) of Rule 17a-9
has been modified from the proposal to refer to credit analysts as individuals an NRSRO
employs “to participate in the determination of credit ratings” instead of individuals who
“produce” credit ratings, and the rule as adopted refers to the NRSRO as producing credit
ratings. 1677
As proposed, paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of Rule 17g-9 identified certain factors that
the NRSRO would need to consider when establishing standards of training, experience, and
competence. 1678 Specifically, the NRSRO would have been required to consider:
•

If the credit rating procedures and methodologies used by the individual involve
qualitative analysis, the knowledge necessary to effectively evaluate and process the data
relevant to the creditworthiness of the obligor being rated or the issuer of the securities or
money market instruments being rated; 1679

•

If the credit rating procedures and methodologies used by the individual involve
quantitative analysis, the technical expertise necessary to understand any models and
model inputs that are a part of the procedures and methodologies; 1680

•

The classes and subclasses of credit ratings for which the individual participates in
determining credit ratings and the factors relevant to such classes and subclasses,
including the geographic location, sector, industry, regulatory and legal framework, and

1675

See paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-9. However, paragraphs (b) and (c) of Rule 17g-9, as adopted, refer to
classes and subclasses of credit ratings. The references to “subclasses” are designed to account for the fact
that rating methodologies used within a class of credit ratings (for example, structured finance) may be
substantially different for certain subclasses (for example, a CDO as compared to an RMBS).

The complexity of the obligors, securities, or money market instruments being rated by
the individual. 1682

The proposed factors were intended to provide guidance to NRSROs about the Commission’s
expectations for the design of the standards of training, experience, and competence. 1683
The Commission is adopting paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-9 substantially as proposed but
with modifications in response to comments. 1684 As adopted, paragraph (b) requires an NRSRO
to consider the following factors when establishing the standards required under paragraph (a):
•

If the credit rating procedures and methodologies used by the individual involve
qualitative analysis, the knowledge necessary to effectively evaluate and process the data
relevant to the creditworthiness of the obligor being rated or the issuer of the securities or
money market instruments being rated; 1685

•

If the credit rating procedures and methodologies used by the individual involve
quantitative analysis, the technical expertise necessary to understand any models and
model inputs that are a part of the procedures and methodologies; 1686

•

The classes and subclasses of credit ratings for which the individual participates in
determining credit ratings and the factors relevant to such classes and subclasses,
including the geographic location, sector, industry, regulatory and legal framework, and
underlying assets, applicable to the obligors or issuers in the classes and subclasses; 1687
and

•

The complexity of the obligors, securities, or money market instruments for which the
individual participates in determining credit ratings. 1688

Commenters addressed paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-9, as proposed. 1689 One commenter
stated that “the Commission should set forth more specific expectations” and that, for example,
“the Commission should provide guidance regarding what kind of technical expertise in
quantitative analysis should be required, depending on how the person will be using quantitative
procedures and methodologies.” 1690 Another commenter stated that the factors listed in
paragraph (b) should include that certain types of securities (for example new or highly complex
securities) may require more training and specialized expertise. 1691 On the other hand, an
NRSRO stated that the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 17g-9 “sufficiently
capture the general issues an NRSRO should consider in designing its analyst training
program.” 1692 Another NRSRO stated that the factors were “reasonable.” 1693
In response to the comment that the rule should include more specific expectations, 1694
the Commission believes the factors strike an appropriate balance in terms of identifying critical
matters an NRSRO should take into consideration but with sufficient generality to have broad
application across NRSROs with different business models, sizes, and rating methodologies,
while identifying specific factors the Commission believes are important for an NRSRO to
consider when designing the standards. Further, as discussed below, the Commission is

adopting, in paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-9, specific items that an NRSRO must include in its
standards of training, experience, and competence. 1695
One commenter stated that the rule should recognize that certain types of securities (for
example new or highly complex securities) may require more training and specialized
expertise. 1696 The factor listed in paragraph (b)(4) of Rule 17g-9, as adopted, requires NRSROs
to consider the complexity of the obligors or securities rated by the analyst when establishing the
standards required under paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-9. The Commission believes that this
requirement achieves the commenter’s objective of having the standards take into account the
complexity of securities being rated by the analyst.
As proposed, paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of Rule 17g-9 provided that an NRSRO must
include the following in the standards, respectively:
•

A requirement for periodic testing of the individuals employed by the NRSRO to
determine credit ratings on their knowledge of the procedures and methodologies used by
the NRSRO to determine credit ratings in the classes and subclasses of credit ratings for
which the individual participates in determining credit ratings; 1697 and

•

A requirement that at least one individual with three years or more experience in
performing credit analysis participates in the determination of a credit rating. 1698
The Commission is adopting paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-9 substantially as proposed but

with modifications in response to comments. 1699 As adopted, paragraph (c)(1) provides that an
NRSRO must include in the standards required under paragraph (a) a requirement for periodic

paragraph (c)(1) from the proposal to replace the phrase “individuals employed by [the NRSRO] to

determination of credit ratings”. See paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-9.

testing of the individuals employed by the NRSRO to participate in the determination of credit
ratings on their knowledge of the procedures and methodologies used by the NRSRO to
determine credit ratings in the classes and subclasses of credit ratings for which the individual
participates in determining credit ratings. 1700
Commenters addressed paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-9, as proposed. 1701 Some
commenters stated that the Commission or another regulatory body or independent credentialing
organization should establish and administer NRSRO testing regimes or establish minimum
testing standards. 1702 One of these commenters stated that the testing requirement should be
more detailed, and should include requirements related to the “frequency of testing, basic
content, consequences of failure, and eligibility for retesting.” 1703 In contrast, three NRSROs
stated that an NRSRO should be able to design its own testing programs. 1704
In response to comments that the Commission or another independent entity should
establish and administer NRSRO credit analyst testing programs or that the testing requirement
should be more detailed, 1705 the Commission notes that section 936 of the Dodd-Frank Act
requires that NRSRO credit analysts be “tested for knowledge of the credit rating process.” 1706
As rating methodologies vary among the NRSROs, the Commission believes it is appropriate for
NRSROs to design their own testing programs, subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b),
and (c) of Rule 17g-9. In particular, the standards for testing must be reasonably designed to

achieve the objective that the NRSRO produces accurate credit ratings in the classes of credit
ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 1707
An NRSRO stated that the testing program should “apply only to the credit rating
procedures and methodologies that fall within the scope of the individual's primary area or areas
of analytical responsibility” and that credit analysts should be tested on the “principal
methodologies” used by the NRSRO to determine credit ratings. 1708 The Commission notes that
the question of whether an NRSRO’s standards for testing are reasonably designed to ensure that
credit analysts meet standards of training, experience, and competence necessary to produce
accurate ratings for categories of issuers whose securities the person rates and that they are tested
for knowledge of the credit rating process will depend on the NRSRO’s rating methodologies
and how the NRSRO requires its credit analysts to apply them. An individual’s primary area or
areas of responsibility certainly will be relevant to the designing testing standards that will apply
to the employee. For example, an NRSRO may need to tailor its training and testing program to
account for the different rating methodologies it uses to determine credit ratings across classes
and subclasses of credit ratings so that a given employee is trained and tested on the particular
rating methodology or methodologies the employee uses to determine credit ratings.
An NRSRO stated that analysts with certain qualifications and subject to professional
examinations and continuing education requirements should be exempt from the testing
requirement. 1709 In response, the Commission notes that section 936 of the Dodd-Frank Act
provides that the Commission shall issue rules that are reasonably designed to ensure that any
person employed by an NRSRO to perform credit ratings is tested for knowledge of the credit

rating process. 1710 Paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-9, as adopted, implements this section by
providing that an NRSRO must include in the standards required under paragraph (a) a
requirement for periodic testing of the individuals employed by the NRSRO to participate in the
determination of credit ratings on their knowledge of the procedures and methodologies used by
the NRSRO to determine credit ratings in the classes and subclasses of credit ratings for which
the individual participates in determining credit ratings. 1711 Consequently, the subject matter of
the training must be the NRSRO’s rating methodologies. This does not mean that the standards
of training established by the NRSRO cannot take into account qualifications, professional
examinations, and continuing education requirements. However, unless external professional
examinations and continuing education requirements address the NRSRO’s specific rating
methodologies, exemptions from the required testing and continuous education requirements
would not be appropriate.
One commenter stated that testing of credit analysts on their knowledge of the credit
rating process could be abused by managers. 1712 The Commission believes testing credit
analysts for knowledge of the credit rating process as mandated by section 936 and Rule 17g-9
will benefit the NRSRO, the analysts employed by the NRSRO, and investors and other users of
credit ratings by promoting the analysts’ adherence to, the proper application of, the NRSRO’s
rating methodologies. In response to the commenter’s concern, the Commission notes that
section 15E(j) of the Exchange Act requires the NRSRO to designate an individual responsible
for, among other things, ensuring compliance with the securities laws. 1713 This individual is

1710

responsible for, among other things, establishing procedures for the receipt, retention, and
treatment of confidential anonymous complaints by employees of the NRSRO. 1714 Thus,
employees have the recourse of submitting confidential and anonymous complaints if managers
seek to abuse the training program administered by the NRSRO. For all of these reasons, the
Commission does not believe it would be appropriate or necessary to refrain from implementing
the statute in response to the concern raised by the commenter.
The Commission is adopting paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-9 with a modification from the
proposal in response to comments. 1715 In particular, a number of commenters addressed the
proposed requirement that at least one individual with three or more years of experience in
performing credit analysis participate in the determination of a credit rating. 1716 Some
commenters stated that the three-year requirement was not sufficient, for example, with respect
to complex securities. 1717 For example, one of these commenters stated that “[g]iven the
enormous complexity of the ratings process, and the importance of ratings in our financial
markets, requiring the involvement of a person with only three years of experience in each rating
is woefully insufficient” and that “[s]ubstantially more seasoning is necessary to ensure that each
rating is properly supervised.” 1718 Similarly, an NRSRO stated that the proposed requirement
“sets such a low bar that it is almost meaningless.” 1719 Another NRSRO stated that “the
Commission should not establish a minimum number of years experience for participating in the

determination of a rating” and that “NRSROs should establish their own requirements.” 1720 In
contrast, one commenter stated that requiring that at least three years of credit rating committee
experience would be “sensible.” 1721
The Commission is persuaded that the rule should not solely require three years of
experience. For example, there may be types of obligors or obligations that – because of their
complexity – require an individual to participate in determining the credit rating who has more
than three years of experience. Consequently, as adopted, paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-9
provides that an NRSRO must include in the standards required under paragraph (a) a
requirement that at least one individual with an appropriate level of experience in performing
credit analysis, which may in some instances be more than, but cannot be less than, three years
participates in the determination of a credit rating. 1722 Thus, the rule requires that the level of
experience be commensurate with the type of obligor or obligation being rated and it sets a floor
of a minimum of three years of experience.
As proposed, paragraph (c)(2) provided that the experience must be in performing credit
analysis. 1723 In the proposing release, the Commission noted that performing credit analysis is
not synonymous with determining credit ratings and that many financial institutions have credit
risk departments staffed by individuals who analyze the creditworthiness of existing and future
counterparties and borrowers. 1724 The Commission stated in the proposing release that it

446

preliminarily intended that this type of work would qualify a credit analyst to meet the three-year
requirement in paragraph (c)(2) of proposed Rule 17g-9. 1725
One commenter stated that the experience should be in determining credit ratings and that
“other experiences in assessing credit should not serve to fulfill this requirement.” 1726 In
contrast, an NRSRO stated that the requisite experience should not be limited to having worked
for an NRSRO because such a requirement “could negatively impact smaller NRSROs and
possible new entrants, given the small number of entities in the industry.” 1727 The Commission
continues to believe that experience performing credit analysis whether in determining credit
ratings or in other contexts (for example, in the credit department of a financial institution) can
qualify an individual to meet the requirement in paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-9, as adopted. In
fact, the fresh perspective of a credit analyst who has been performing credit analysis for
purposes other than determining credit ratings could promote the quality of credit ratings and
innovation.
Finally, one commenter stated that that an experienced analyst also should be required to
certify approval of the rating in writing. 1728 At this time, due to other measures in place, the
Commission does not believe such a requirement is necessary. First, as discussed above, the
Commission is implementing section 15E(q)(2)(F) through paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of Rule 17g-7,
as adopted. This paragraph, as adopted, provides that the NRSRO must attach to the form
accompanying a credit rating a signed statement by a person within the NRSRO stating that the
person has responsibility for the rating action and, to the best knowledge of the person: (1) no

part of the credit rating was influenced by any other business activities; (2) the credit rating was
based solely upon the merits of the obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated;
and (3) the credit rating was an independent evaluation of the credit risk of the obligor, security,
or money market instrument. Second, paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-2 requires NRSROs to make
and retain records with respect to each current credit rating, including the identity of any credit
analyst that participated in determining the rating and the identity of any person that approved
the credit rating.
2.

Amendment to Rule 17g-2

The Commission proposed adding paragraph (b)(15) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the
standards of training, experience, and competence the NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce,
and document pursuant to proposed Rule 17g-9 as a record that must be retained. 1729 As a result,
the standards would have been subject to the record retention and production requirements in
paragraphs (c) through (f) of Rule 17g-2. 1730 The Commission stated that this record, along with
other records the proposal would have required NRSROs to make, should be subject to the same
recordkeeping requirements applicable to other records an NRSRO is required to retain pursuant
to Rule 17g-2. 1731
One commenter stated that “we strongly support the Commission proposal to make
training, testing, and experience policies subject to recordkeeping requirements” and that the
Commission “should make clear that this includes testing results.” 1732 Another commenter

1729

See section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, which requires an NRSRO to make and keep such records, and
make and disseminate such reports, as the Commission prescribes by rule as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C.

stated that “the documentation requirement should include documentation not only of the
standards, but also of the implementation, including records showing that analysts have been
tested, that ratings have been reviewed for accuracy to identify weaknesses in the training
regime, and that a seasoned analyst has participated in and approved of each credit rating.” 1733
The Commission does not believe for now that it is necessary to require the documentation
and/or retention of these specific types of records. The Commission notes that NRSROs may
need to be able to demonstrate compliance with Rule 17g-9 and that making and retaining
records showing that analysts have been tested and the experience level of persons participating
in credit ratings is one way to demonstrate compliance with the rule. Further, as noted above,
paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17g-2 requires NRSROs to make and retain records with respect to each
current credit rating, including the identities of any credit analyst that participated in determining
the rating and the identity of any person that approved the credit rating. 1734 Finally, using credit
rating performance statistics could be a useful input in evaluating the effectiveness of training
programs. 1735
The Commission is adding paragraph (b)(15) to Rule 17g-2 as proposed. 1736 This will
provide a means for the Commission to monitor the NRSROs’ compliance with Rule 17g-9. The
record must be retained until three years after the date the record is replaced with an updated

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the amendments and new
rule relating to the standards of training, experience, and competence. 1738 The baseline that
existed before today’s adoption of Rule 17g-9 and the amendment to Rule 17g-2 was one in
which an NRSRO was not required to establish, maintain, enforce, and document standards of
training, experience, and competence for its credit analysts that are reasonably designed to
achieve the objective that the NRSRO produces accurate credit ratings in the classes of credit
ratings for which the NRSRO is registered and that include a requirement to conduct periodic
testing of its credit analysts for knowledge of the NRSRO’s procedures and methodologies to
determine credit ratings and a requirement that at least one individual with an appropriate level
of experience in performing credit analysis, but not less than three years, participates in the
determination of a credit rating. Further, NRSROs were not required to retain a record
documenting the procedures and methodologies. However, NRSROs and applicants for
registration as NRSROs were required to disclose in Exhibit 8 to Form NRSRO a general
description of the minimum qualifications required of their credit analysts and credit analyst
supervisors, including education level and work experience.
Relative to this baseline, Rule 17g-9 and the amendment to Rule 17g-2 will likely
provide benefits. These new requirements should result in higher levels of competency among

1737

See paragraphs (b)(15) and (c) of Rule 17g-2.

1738

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may
derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today.

450

NRSRO credit analysts, which should result in higher quality credit ratings. The factors
enumerated in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-9 could serve an investor protection function by
providing benchmarks that could be used by the Commission and the NRSRO to evaluate
whether a given NRSRO’s standards are reasonably designed to meet the objective that the
NRSRO produce accurate credit ratings in the classes of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is
registered. In particular, the first two factors should help the Commission and the NRSRO
evaluate the degree to which knowledge and technical expertise with respect to data and models
is emphasized in the standards of an NRSRO. The latter two factors should help the
Commission and the NRSRO evaluate the degree to which expertise in factors relevant to credit
ratings and the complexity of obligors, securities, or money market instruments are emphasized
in the NRSRO’s standards of training for its credit analysts.
The requirement in paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 17g-9 that at least one individual with an
appropriate level of experience in performing credit analysis, but not less than three years,
participates in the determination of a credit rating should help achieve the objective that an
NRSRO produces accurate credit ratings. The requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 17g-9 for
periodic testing of an NRSRO’s credit analysts on their knowledge of the NRSRO’s procedures
and methodologies to determine credit ratings in the classes and subclasses of credit ratings for
which the individual participates in determining credit ratings should also enhance integrity and
quality of the credit ratings. Higher quality credit ratings should benefit those who use credit
ratings in making investment and credit-based decisions. The requirement to document the
standards will also help the NRSRO to adhere to the standards.
The record the NRSROs must retain under the amendment to Rule 17g-2 will be used by
Commission examiners to evaluate whether a given NRSRO’s policies and procedures are

451

reasonably designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produces accurate credit ratings in
the classes of credit ratings for which it is registered and whether the NRSRO is complying with
the policies and procedures.
Relative to the baseline, the amendments and new rule will result in costs for NRSROs.
NRSROs will incur one-time costs when establishing and documenting the standards of training,
experience, and competence for NRSRO credit analysts and ongoing costs to update these
standards and conduct periodic testing. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the
Commission estimates that Rule 17g-9 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs to
NRSROs of approximately $7,834,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of
approximately $1,629,000. 1739 Further, NRSROs will incur costs in conducting periodic testing
for knowledge of the credit rating process. The cost of this testing will likely vary significantly
across NRSROs and depend on their size, the different types of credit ratings they issue, and the
complexity of their methodologies. However, based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the
Commission estimates that Rule 17g-9 will result in additional total industry-wide annual costs
for NRSROs to conduct periodic testing of their credit analysts of approximately $5,990,000. 1740
Relative to the baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-2 prescribing retention
requirements for the documentation of the standards will result in costs to NRSROs. NRSROs
already have recordkeeping systems in place to comply with the recordkeeping requirements in
Rule 17g-2 before today’s amendments. Therefore, the recordkeeping costs of this rule will be
incremental to the costs associated with these existing requirements. Specifically, the
1739

See section V.K. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs
identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.8. of this release.

1740

See section V.K. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs identified in the
PRA analysis in section IV.D.8. of this release.

452

incremental costs will consist largely of updating their record retention policies and procedures
and retaining and producing the additional record. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA,
the Commission estimates that paragraph (b)(15) of Rule 17g-2 and the amendment to paragraph
(c) of Rule 17g-2 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs to NRSROs of approximately
$12,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of approximately $3,000. 1741
A possible additional cost is that the requirements could distort the labor market for
individuals with at least three years of experience in performing credit analysis. For example,
NRSROs may need to pay a premium to retain such individuals, which may inhibit them from
moving to productive activity in other industries. The magnitude of this cost is infeasible to
estimate as the degree to which these salaries may increase is unknown.
The amendments and new rule should have a number of effects related to efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 1742 First, they could improve the quality of credit ratings.
As a result, users of credit ratings could make more efficient investment decisions based on this
higher-quality information. Market efficiency could also improve if this information is reflected
in asset prices. Consequently, capital formation could also improve as capital could flow to
more efficient uses with the benefit of this enhanced information. These amendments also will
result in costs, which may have a component that is fixed in magnitude across NRSROs and does
not depend on the size of an NRSRO. Therefore, the operating costs per credit rating of smaller
NRSROs may increase relative to that of larger NRSROs, creating adverse effects on
competition. As a result of these amendments, the barriers to entry for credit rating agencies to

1741

one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

453

register as an NRSRO might be higher for credit rating agencies, while some NRSROs,
particularly smaller firms, may decide to withdraw from registration as an NRSRO. These costs
also will depend on the complexity of operations within the NRSRO.
There are reasonable alternatives to the requirements in the amendments and new rule.
First, the Commission or an independent entity could provide standards for training and testing
programs or administer these programs as suggested by commenters. 1743 As discussed earlier,
the Commission believes at this time that allowing NRSROs the flexibility to design their own
standards achieves an appropriate balance between prescribing standards and allowing NRSROs
to tailor the standards to their business models, size, and rating methodologies, which vary
significantly across NRSROs and potential NRSRO applicants.
Another alternative is that the Commission could make the requirements of paragraph
(c)(2) of Rule 17g-9 less restrictive. For example, one commenter suggested that the
Commission not require a minimum number of years of experience for individuals participating
in the determination of credit ratings and that NRSROs should establish their own
requirements. 1744 However, if NRSROs established a lower requirement, this alternative could
decrease the quality of credit ratings by decreasing the level of expertise brought to
determinations of credit ratings. However, it could also decrease costs if it eliminates the
potential distortions to the labor market for analysts with at least three years of experience
discussed earlier.

UNIVERSAL RATING SYMBOLS

Section 938(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Commission shall require, by
rule, each NRSRO to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that: (1)

assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will default, fail to
make timely payments, or otherwise not make payments to investors in accordance with the
terms of the security or money market instrument; 1745 (2) clearly define and disclose the meaning
of any symbol used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating; 1746 and (3) apply any symbol
described in item (2) in a manner that is consistent for all types of securities and money market
instruments for which the symbol is used. 1747 Section 938(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides
that nothing in section 938 shall prohibit an NRSRO from using distinct sets of symbols to
denote credit ratings for different types of securities or money market instruments. 1748
Further, section 939(h)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Commission shall
undertake a study on the feasibility and desirability of:
•

standardizing credit rating terminology, so that all credit rating agencies issue credit
ratings using identical terms;

•

standardizing the market stress conditions under which ratings are evaluated;

•

requiring a quantitative correspondence between credit ratings and a range of default
probabilities and loss expectations under standardized conditions of economic stress; and

•

standardizing credit rating terminology across asset classes, so that named ratings
correspond to a standard range of default probabilities and expected losses independent of
asset class and issuing entity. 1749

Section 939(h)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Commission shall submit to Congress
a report containing the findings of the study and the recommendations, if any, of the Commission

with respect to the study. 1750 The Commission submitted the staff report to Congress in
September 2012. 1751
Finally, section 15E(c)(2) of the Exchange Act provides, in pertinent part, that the
Commission may not regulate the substance of credit ratings or the procedures and
methodologies by which any NRSRO determines credit ratings. 1752
The Commission proposed to implement section 938(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act by
proposing paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 and by adding paragraph (b)(14) to Rule 17g-2. 1753
1.

Paragraph (b) of New Rule 17g-8

Section 938(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act prescribes the policies and procedures the
Commission shall require, by rule, of each NRSRO. 1754 Consequently, paragraph (b) of Rule
17g-8, as proposed, was modeled on the statutory text. 1755
As proposed, the prefatory text of paragraph (b) provided that an NRSRO must establish,
maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve
three objectives identified in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3). 1756 The prefatory text of paragraph
(b), as proposed, mirrored the prefatory text of section 938(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, except that
the proposed rule text included the word “document” so that the rule, as proposed, would require

the NRSRO to document the policies and procedures it establishes, maintains, and enforces. 1757
The requirement was added so that an NRSRO would need to set forth its policies and
procedures in writing. 1758 This requirement, coupled with the Commission’s proposed
amendment to Rule 17g-2, was designed, among other things, to make the policies and
procedures more readily available to Commission examiners. 1759 Documenting the policies and
procedures in writing also will promote the NRSRO’s compliance with them. For all these
reasons, the Commission is adopting the prefatory text as proposed. 1760
Paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would require the NRSRO to have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to assess the probability that an issuer of a security or
money market instrument will default, fail to make timely payments, or otherwise not make
payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the security or money market
instrument. 1761 The text of this provision mirrored the text of section 938(a)(1) of the DoddFrank Act. 1762 One commenter stated that the paragraph, as proposed, was “sufficiently
explicit.” 1763 The Commission is adopting paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17g-8 as proposed. 1764
The Commission noted in the proposing release that section 15E(s)(3)(B)(ii) of the
Exchange Act provides that the Commission’s rule requiring an NRSRO to generate a form to
disclose information with the publication of a credit rating requires disclosure of information on
the content of the credit rating, including: (1) the historical performance of the credit rating; and

(2) the expected probability of default and the expected loss in the event of default. 1765 As
discussed above in section II.G.3. of this release, the Commission has implemented this
requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(L) of Rule 17g-7, as adopted. 1766 The Commission continues
to believe that paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted, will work in conjunction with the
requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(L) of Rule 17g-7, as adopted, in that the policies and
procedures required under paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17g-8 will assist the NRSRO in generating
the information required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(L) of Rule 17g-7. The
information produced by an NRSRO’s policies and procedures under paragraph (b)(1) is
expected to be relevant to the credit analyses performed by the NRSRO.
Paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would require the NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to clearly define
each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating
category and notches within a category for each class and subclass of credit ratings for which the
NRSRO is registered and to include such definitions in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. 1767 This
proposed provision would implement section 938(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1768 One
commenter stated that the paragraph, as proposed, was “sufficiently explicit.” 1769
The Commission is adopting paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-8 substantially as
proposed. 1770 As adopted, the paragraph provides that an NRSRO must establish, maintain,

event of default).

enforce, and document policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to clearly define
each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating
category and notches within a category for each class of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is
registered (including subclasses within each class) and to include such definitions in Exhibit 1 to
Form NRSRO. 1771
In the proposing release, the Commission stated that paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-8
would work in conjunction with the requirements to disclose definitions of symbols, numbers, or
scores that denote credit rating categories and notches within categories in Exhibit 1 to Form
NRSRO. 1772 As discussed above in section II.E.1. of this release, Exhibit 1 requires, among
other things, that an NRSRO clearly define, after the presentation of all applicable
Transition/Default Matrices, each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the
NRSRO to denote a credit rating category and notches within a category for each class and
subclass of credit ratings in any Transition/Default Matrix presented in the Exhibit. 1773
Consequently, taken together, paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted, and the instructions
for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO require an NRSRO to have policies and procedures that clearly
define the meaning of each symbol, number, or score used by the NRSRO to denote a credit
rating and to disclose those meanings in Exhibit 1 where investors and other users of credit
ratings can find them.

1771

See id. The text of paragraph (b)(2), as proposed, referred to “each class and subclass of credit ratings” for
which the NRSRO is registered. As discussed above in section II.I.1. of this release, the Commission has
modified paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-9 to, among other things, remove a reference to an NRSRO being
registered in a subclass of credit ratings. Consistent with this modification, the Commission is modifying
paragraph (b)(2) from the proposal to remove the reference to being registered in a subclass of credit
ratings. However, the Commission added a parenthetical to the rule text to include a reference to
“subclasses” of credit ratings.

Paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 17g-8, as proposed, would require the NRSRO to have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to apply any symbol, number, or score defined pursuant to
paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 17g-8 in a manner that is consistent for all types of obligors, securities,
and money market instruments for which the symbol, number, or score is used. 1774 This
provision mirrored the text of section 938(a)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act, except that the proposed
rule text added the term “obligors.” 1775 The Commission proposed this addition in order to apply
the provisions of paragraph (b)(3), as proposed, to credit ratings of obligors as entities in addition
to credit ratings of securities and money market instruments. 1776 One commenter stated that the
paragraph, as proposed, was “sufficiently explicit.” 1777 The Commission is adopting paragraph
(b)(3) of Rule 17g-8 as proposed. 1778
The Commission received comments regarding paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 17g-8. 1779
One NRSRO stated that it supported the proposal and that it “is generally consistent” with what
the NRSRO “does today.” 1780 Another NRSRO stated, as noted above, that the rule text was
“sufficiently explicit” and also stated that it did not support the addition of further detail
regarding the objectives of the rule, and that additional requirements with respect to the rule may
“interfere with the analytical independence of NRSROs in violation of Section 15E(c)(2) of the
Exchange Act.” 1781

Several commenters were critical of the proposal. 1782 One commenter stated that
paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 17g-8 did not achieve the objective of section 938 of the DoddFrank Act. 1783 This commenter raised concerns about how municipalities are assigned credit
ratings as compared to other types of obligors and recommended that the Commission “adopt
language that would clearly require NRSROs to apply symbols consistently across classes and
subclasses of credit ratings.” 1784 Similarly, another commenter stated that because the proposed
rule does not “require that rating symbols would have to be designed to clearly reflect the
potential degree of default,” the rule will not “correct the discrepancy between what AAA means
in the municipal or corporate debt context and what it means in the structured product
context.” 1785 One commenter stated that the Commission should re-propose the rule and, in
doing so, require NRSROs “to specify an acceptable range of default probabilities and
corresponding loss expectations for each asset class and rating symbol.” 1786 The commenter also
provided its analysis of NRSROs’ credit rating performance statistics as disclosed in Exhibit 1 to
Form NRSRO through 2012, which the commenter stated shows that “performance across asset
classes has not been comparable.” 1787
The Commission shares the concerns raised by these commenters that the historical
performance of credit ratings at the same notch in a global rating scale of some NRSROs has

been significantly different for certain classes of credit ratings, particularly the historical
performance of credit ratings of structured finance products. The Commission staff noted this
inconsistency of performance in its 2012 report on credit rating standardization, which was
submitted to Congress as required by section 939(h)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1788
In drafting paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8, the Commission has sought to address this
concern in a manner that strikes an appropriate balance between adopting a measure designed to
address inconsistencies in the performance of credit ratings in different classes to which an
NRSRO applies the same rating scale and definitions with the prohibition in section 15E(c)(2) of
the Exchange Act under which the Commission may not regulate the substance of credit ratings
or the procedures and methodologies by which any NRSRO determines credit ratings. 1789 In
seeking to strike this balance, the Commission modeled the rule closely on the text of section
938(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1790 This section provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission
shall require, by rule, each NRSRO to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures to, among other things, apply any defined credit rating symbol in a manner that is
consistent for all types of securities and money market instruments for which the symbol is
used. 1791 The Commission also considered the fact that section 939(h)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act
required the Commission to study certain matters relating to credit rating standardization (as
opposed to mandating rulemaking), including the feasibility and desirability of standardizing
credit rating terminology across asset classes, so that named ratings correspond to a standard
range of default probabilities and expected losses independent of asset class and issuing

entity. 1792 Comments received in response to the study argued that that the Commission does not
have the authority to require credit rating standardization because, by statute, the Commission
may not regulate the methodologies NRSROs use to determine credit ratings. 1793 Moreover, as
required under section 939(h)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission was required to report
its findings to Congress upon completion of the study. 1794 The Commission submitted a staff
report to Congress in 2012 and the findings in the report have not resulted in any legislative
changes relating to credit rating standardization at this time. 1795
The Commission believes at this time that paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8, as adopted,
implements section 938(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act in a manner that appropriately balances
relevant concerns. The rule requires NRSROs to have policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to apply the definition of any credit symbol, number, or score in a manner
that is consistent for all types of obligors, securities, and money market instruments for which
the symbol, number, or score is used. 1796 An NRSRO – in establishing, maintaining, and
enforcing these policies and procedures – will need to take into consideration how it applies its
rating scales and definitions to classes of credit ratings and the rating methodologies it uses to
determine credit ratings in those classes. Moreover, the prefatory text of the rule requires that
the policies and procedures must be reasonably designed. 1797 Consequently, Rule 17g-8, as
adopted, requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the

objective of consistency without specifically mandating how an NRSRO’s credit ratings and
rating methodologies must be designed to achieve this consistency.
Commenters raised concerns about how the Commission would enforce Rule 17g-8, as
proposed. 1798 One commenter stated that “the Commission fails to make clear how it will
enforce the requirement that ratings be based on an assessment of the likelihood of default and
applied consistently across different rating categories.” 1799 In particular, the commenter asked
what standards the Commission will use to determine whether ratings are being applied
consistently across categories of ratings and what steps will NRSROs be required to take if their
performance statistics reveal discrepancies in the performance of ratings across different rating
categories. 1800 The commenter that suggested that the Commission re-propose the rule stated
that, if ratings of certain asset classes diverge significantly from the expected norms, the
Commission should require the NRSRO to identify the source of the error that led to the
divergence and what it is doing to remedy the problem and “where the divergence in ratings
performance across asset classes persists, the Commission should require the NRSRO to adjust
its methodology – which in turn could affect its outstanding and prospective ratings – to correct
the problem.” 1801 The commenter further stated that a different system of symbols should be
used for certain asset classes “where comparability cannot be achieved.” 1802 In addition, the
commenter stated that the Commission should hold NRSROs accountable if they fail to achieve a
high degree of ratings comparability between asset classes by, for example, seeking fines or the
disgorgement of profits or suspending or revoking the NRSRO’s registration for the affected

asset class. 1803 In contrast, an NRSRO stated that “because credit ratings reflect forward-looking
opinions, we would be concerned about any attempt to judge an NRSRO’s adherence to this
proposed rule based on an analysis of its ratings performance over any defined period of time”
and that “an NRSRO’s compliance with this rule should be measured by whether the NRSRO
has policies and procedures in place to promote comparability of ratings across the asset classes
it rates and has adhered to such policies and procedures.” 1804
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8,
as adopted, sets forth an objective: that the definition of any credit rating symbol, number, or
score is applied in a manner that is consistent for all types of obligors, securities, and money
market instruments for which the symbol, number, or score is used. 1805 Further, the rule
provides that an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve this objective. 1806 Consequently, in enforcing
the rule, the Commission will consider whether the NRSRO is achieving the objective through
the use of established procedures and methodologies that are reasonably designed. In response
to the commenters, the Commission agrees that the performance of credit ratings (transition and
default statistics) in each class of credit ratings for which the NRSRO applies the same rating
scale and definitions will be relevant to considering whether the objective of consistency is being
met. 1807 If the Commission staff believes the objective of consistency is not being met, the staff
will need to consider whether the NRSRO has established, maintained, enforced, and
documented policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve this objective before

making a recommendation to the Commission that the Commission institute an enforcement
action. The staff may also bring a potential violation to the attention of the NRSRO. In response
to the commenters, the Commission notes that if appropriate the Commission can take
enforcement action for such a violation. 1808 Finally, an NRSRO that has not complied with
paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 may take steps to adjust its rating methodology or use different
rating scales and definitions for different classes of credit ratings, as suggested by one of the
commenters, to the extent doing so is necessary and appropriate to address the failure. 1809
2.

Amendment to Rule 17g-2

The Commission proposed adding paragraph (b)(14) of Rule 17g-2 to identify the
policies and procedures an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to
paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 as a record that must be retained. 1810 As a result, the policies and
procedures would be subject to the record retention and production requirements in paragraphs
(c) through (f) of Rule 17g-2. One NRSRO stated that it “supports” the amendment to Rule 17g2. 1811 The Commission is adding paragraph (b)(14) to Rule 17g-2 as proposed. 1812 This will
provide a means for the Commission to monitor the NRSROs’ compliance with paragraph (b) of
Rule 17g-8 as a record. The record must be retained until three years after the date the record is

See CFA II Letter. As discussed above in section II.D. of this release, the Exchange Act provides the
Commission with authority to impose a wide range of fines, penalties, and other sanctions on NRSROs for
violations of any section of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78o7(d); 15 U.S.C. 78u; 15 U.S.C. 78u; 15 U.S.C. 78u-2; 15 U.S.C. 78u-3; 15 U.S.C. 78ff.

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the amendments and new
rule regarding NRSRO credit rating symbols, numbers, or scores. 1814 The economic baseline
that existed before today’s new rules was one in which an NRSRO was not required to establish,
maintain, enforce, document, and retain records of policies and procedures reasonably designed
to: assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will default, fail
to make timely payments, or otherwise not make payments to investors in accordance with the
terms of the security or money market instrument; clearly define each symbol, number, or score
in the NRSRO’s rating scale for each class of credit ratings (including subclasses within each
class) for which the NRSRO is registered; or to apply any such symbol, number, or score in a
manner that is consistent for all types of obligors, securities, and money market instruments for
which the symbol, number, or score is used. However, the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form
NRSRO required an NRSRO or a credit rating agency applying for registration as an NRSRO to
“define the credit rating categories, notches, grades, and rankings used” by the NRSRO or
applicant. 1815

1813

See paragraphs (b)(14) and (c) of Rule 17g-2.

1814

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may
derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today.

1815

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 required an NRSRO to make Form NRSRO and
Exhibits 1 through 9 publicly available on its website “or through another comparable, readily accessible
means.”

467

One academic study finds that performance within comparable rating categories has been
inconsistent across asset classes from 1980 until 2010. 1816 In addition, it has been reported that
five-year default rates for CDOs at the lowest investment-grade rating as determined by a large
NRSRO were roughly ten times higher from 1993 to 2005 than for corporate bonds at the same
rating for the same NRSRO from 1983 to 2005. 1817 Another academic study concludes that
having new structured products rated similarly to corporate bonds created the illusion of
comparability with existing “single-name” securities and provided access to a large pool of
potential buyers in the years prior to the financial crisis. 1818 This academic study also finds
evidence suggesting that differences in observed default rates between structured products and
comparable corporate bonds may be explained by differences in the types of risk to which these
instruments are exposed. 1819
Relative to this baseline, paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 should provide benefits. In
particular, it should promote greater consistency by NRSROs in terms of assigning credit ratings
across different classes of credit ratings and, thereby, promote the information value of credit
ratings as assessments of relative creditworthiness for the benefit of users of credit ratings. The
requirement that an NRSRO have policies and procedures reasonably designed to assess the
probability that an issuer will default, fail to make timely payments, or otherwise not make
payments to investors should facilitate this outcome. Specifically, this assessment may provide
additional inputs in terms of the relative creditworthiness of obligors and issuers, which may be

used to inform credit ratings if deemed appropriate by the NRSRO, and thereby improve the
quality of credit ratings as assessments of relative creditworthiness. The requirement that an
NRSRO have policies and procedures to disclose the meaning of credit rating symbols, numbers,
and scores could benefit users of credit ratings by promoting a better understanding of credit
rating terminology and allowing these parties to better compare the various credit ratings issued
by a single NRSRO and credit ratings across NRSROs.
The records the NRSRO must retain under the amendments to Rule 17g-2 will be used by
Commission examiners to evaluate whether a given NRSRO’s policies and procedures are
reasonably designed and the NRSRO is adhering to them. Setting forth the policies and
procedures in writing also will promote adherence to them by the NRSRO.
Relative to the baseline, paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 will result in costs for NRSROs.
NRSROs will need to expend resources to develop the policies and procedures required by the
rule, to document, comply with, and enforce them, and to update them periodically as
appropriate. Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that
paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs to NRSROs of
approximately $566,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of approximately
$142,000. 1820
NRSROs may also incur costs expending resources to modify credit rating symbols,
numbers, scores, and their definitions in order to conform to the requirement that these symbols,
numbers, and scores be applied consistently across applicable asset classes. For example, one
NRSRO claimed that the new rule would require some NRSROs to change their rating symbol

1820

one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs
identified in the PRA analysis in section IV.D.3. of this release.

469

systems or how they apply their symbols to certain categories of obligors or obligations. 1821
However, another NRSRO stated that the new rule “is generally consistent” with what it “does
today.” 1822 This cost will likely vary significantly across NRSROs and depend on the number of
asset classes rated and the degree to which their current symbols, numbers, and scores are
applied consistently.
Relative to the baseline, the amendments to Rule 17g-2 prescribing retention
requirements for the documentation of the policies and procedures will result in costs to
NRSROs. NRSROs already have recordkeeping systems in place to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements in Rule 17g-2 before today’s amendments. Therefore, the
recordkeeping costs of this rule will be incremental to the costs associated with these existing
requirements. Specifically, the incremental costs will consist largely of updating their record
retention policies and procedures and retaining and producing the additional record. Based on
analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that paragraph (b)(14) of Rule 17g2 and the amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 will result in total industry-wide one-time
costs to NRSROs of approximately $12,000 and total industry-wide annual costs to NRSROs of
approximately $3,000. 1823
As an additional possible cost, the final rule has the potential to decrease the quality of
credit ratings in circumstances where the subjective judgment of participants in the rating
process could improve the quality of ratings. In order to ensure that rating symbols, numbers,
and scores are applied consistently across applicable ratings in compliance with these

requirements, an NRSRO may establish credit rating procedures and methodologies that
diminish the ability of participants in the rating process to exercise subjective judgment. The
credit ratings may not therefore benefit fully from the expertise of the participants in the rating
process. These amendments may also increase costs associated with understanding the definition
of rating symbols, numbers, and scores. In order to ensure that rating symbols, numbers, and
scores are applied consistently across applicable ratings in compliance with these requirements,
an NRSRO may create different rating symbols, numbers, and scores for different asset classes.
As a result, users of credit ratings may need to expend more effort in understanding a greater
number of definitions.
The amendments and new rule should have a number of effects related to efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 1824 First, they could improve the quality and consistency of
credit ratings as well as increasing the information available to users of credit ratings regarding
the meaning of rating symbols, numbers, and scores. As a result, users of credit ratings could
make more efficient investment decisions based on this higher-quality information. Market
efficiency could also improve if this information is reflected in asset prices. Consequently,
capital formation also could improve as capital could flow to more efficient uses with the benefit
of this enhanced information. Alternatively, the quality of credit ratings may decrease in certain
circumstances if an NRSRO establishes credit rating procedures and methodologies that diminish
the ability of participants in the rating process to exercise subjective judgment. In this case, the
quality of credit ratings may decrease, which could decrease the efficiency of investment
decisions made by users of credit ratings. Market efficiency and capital formation also may be
adversely impacted if lower quality information is reflected in asset prices, which may impede

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

471

the flow of capital to efficient uses. These amendments will result in costs, some of which may
have a component that is fixed in magnitude across NRSROs, and does not vary with the size of
the NRSRO. Therefore, the operating costs per credit rating of smaller NRSROs may increase
relative to that of larger NRSROs, creating adverse effects on competition. As a result of these
amendments, the barriers to entry for credit rating agencies to register as an NRSRO might be
higher for credit rating agencies, while some NRSROs, particularly smaller firms, may decide to
withdraw from registration as an NRSRO.

ANNUAL REPORT OF DESIGNATED COMPLIANCE OFFICER

Section 932(a)(5) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 15E(j) of the Exchange Act to
re-designate paragraph (j) as paragraph (j)(1) and to add paragraphs (j)(2) through (j)(5). 1825
Section 15E(j)(1) of the Exchange Act contains a self-executing provision that requires that an
NRSRO designate an individual (the “designated compliance officer”) responsible for
administering the policies and procedures that are required to be established pursuant to sections
15E(g) and (h) of the Exchange Act, 1826 and for compliance with the securities laws and the rules
and regulations under the securities laws, including those promulgated by the Commission under
section 15E of the Exchange Act. 1827 Sections 15E(j)(2) through (4) of the Exchange Act
contain self-executing requirements with respect to, among other things, the activities, duties,
and compensation of the designated compliance officer. 1828
Section 15E(j)(5)(A) of the Exchange Act contains a self-executing requirement that the
designated compliance officer must submit to the NRSRO an annual report on the compliance of

policies of the NRSRO; and (2) a certification that the report is accurate and complete. 1829
Section 15E(j)(5)(B) of the Exchange Act contains a self-executing requirement that the NRSRO
shall file the report required under section 15E(j)(5)(A) together with the financial report that is
required to be submitted to the Commission under section 15E of the Exchange Act. 1830
Section 15E(k) of the Exchange Act provides that each NRSRO shall, on a confidential
basis, file with the Commission, at intervals determined by the Commission, such financial
statements, certified (if required by the rules or regulations of the Commission) by an
independent public accountant, and information concerning its financial condition, as the
Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. 1831 The Commission implemented section 15E(k) by adopting Rule 17g3. 1832 Therefore, under the self-executing requirement in section 15E(j)(5)(B) of the Exchange
Act, an NRSRO must file the report of the designated compliance officer with the reports
required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3. 1833

five or, in some cases, six separate reports within ninety days after the end of the NRSRO’s

fiscal year and identified the reports that must be furnished. 1834 The first report – on the
NRSRO’s financial statements – must be audited; the remaining reports may be unaudited.
1.

Amendment to Rule 17g-3

The Commission proposed adding paragraph (a)(8) to Rule 17g-3 to identify the report
on the compliance of the NRSRO with the securities laws and the policies and procedures of the
NRSRO required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to section 15E(j)(5)(B) of the
Exchange Act as a report that must be filed with the other reports required under Rule 17g-3. 1835
Paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17g-3 would provide that the report would be “unaudited.” 1836 As
stated above, section 15E(j)(5)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act provides that the designated
compliance officer must certify that the report is accurate and complete.
Commenters addressed this proposal. 1837 One commenter supported the Commission’s
proposal to include the report as one of the annual financial reports an NRSRO is required to file
with the Commission, 1838 and another stated that the proposed requirement would facilitate
effective NRSRO oversight by the Commission. 1839 This commenter stated that the requirement
could be strengthened, however, by requiring the annual report be subjected to a third-party
audit. 1840 Two commenters stated that the rule should not prescribe how the report must be
certified because another section of the Exchange Act already provides that the designated
1834

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33481-33482. As discussed above in
section II.A.3. of this release, an NRSRO must file an additional internal controls report and, as discussed
below, an NRSRO must file the report of the designated compliance officer. See paragraphs (a)(7) and
(a)(8) of Rule 17g-3. Consequently, an NRSRO must now file seven or, in some cases, eight reports.

compliance officer must certify that the report is accurate and complete. 1841 Specifically, one
commenter stated that this requirement would be “unnecessarily duplicative.” 1842 The other
commenter stated that the certification already required by section 15E(j)(5)(A)(ii) of the
Exchange Act is sufficient. 1843
The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(8) to Rule 17g-3 as proposed. In response to
the comment suggesting that the Commission require that the report be subject to a third-party
audit, 1844 the Commission is not persuaded that such a requirement is necessary at this time,
given the cost of requiring a third-party audit. Section 15E(j)(5)(A) of the Exchange Act
provides that the report shall be filed with “together with the financial report that is required to
be submitted to the Commission under” section 15E. 1845 Section 15E(k) provides, in pertinent
part, that the financial reports shall be filed on a confidential basis. 1846 Consequently, the report
of the designated compliance officer is not a public document that will be relied upon by
investors and other users of credit ratings. The report is a non-public report that will be used by
Commission examiners, who can consider the accuracy of the report in the context of their
annual examinations of NRSROs. 1847 Finally, the Commission agrees with the commenters that
it is not necessary to prescribe how the report must be certified because section 15E(j)(5)(A)(ii)

The report also will be used as governance tool by the NRSRO to evaluate its compliance with the

is accurate and complete. 1848
2.

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the amendment
regarding the annual report of the designated compliance officer. 1849 The economic baseline
which existed before today’s amendments was one in which section 15E(j)(5)(A) of the
Exchange Act requires that the designated compliance officer of an NRSRO submit to the
NRSRO an annual report on the NRSRO’s compliance with its policies and procedures and the
securities laws, that includes a description of any material changes to the NRSRO’s code of
ethics and conflicts of interest policies and a certification that the report is accurate and
complete. In addition, section 15E(j)(B) of the Exchange Act requires the NRSRO to file the
report with the financial report that is required to be submitted to the Commission under section
15E of the Exchange Act. The Commission is adding paragraph (a)(8) to Rule 17g-3 to reflect
the baseline requirement that the report must be filed with the other reports filed pursuant to Rule
17g-3. The amendment is not expected to result in benefits or costs relative to the economic
baseline and is not expected to affect efficiency, competition, or capital formation.
One reasonable alternative to the amendment, as adopted, is to establish a requirement
that the report be audited by a third party, as suggested by one commenter. 1850 This alternative
would increase the cost of compliance with the rule, as NRSROs would be required to pay a third
party to conduct the audit. However, an audit by a third party may improve the accuracy,

reliability, and thoroughness of the report. As a result, this alternative could enhance
Commission oversight of NRSROs as well as improve an NRSRO’s internal compliance
controls, which could improve the integrity and quality of an NRSRO’s credit ratings.
As discussed above, the Commission is not persuaded that such a requirement is
necessary at this time, given the cost of requiring a third-party audit and how the audit would be
used. 1851 The report of the designated compliance officer is not a public document that will be
relied upon by investors and other users of credit ratings. Instead, it will be used by Commission
examiners, who can consider the accuracy of the report in the context of their annual
examinations of NRSROs.

ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF FORM NRSRO AND THE RULE 17g-3
ANNUAL REPORTS

Amendments to Rule 17g-1, Form NRSRO, Rule 17g-3, and Regulation
S-T

Before today’s amendments, applicants for registration as an NRSRO and NRSROs
submitted Form NRSRO to the Commission in paper form. 1852 In addition, NRSROs submitted
their annual reports under Rule 17g-3 in paper form. 1853 The Commission proposed amending
Rule 17g-1, the instructions to Form NRSRO, Rule 17g-3, and Regulation S-T 1854 to implement
a program for filing Forms NRSRO (other than in the case of a registration application) and the
annual reports electronically. 1855 Under the proposals, an NRSRO would be required to use the
Commission’s EDGAR system to: (1) electronically file or furnish, as applicable, Form NRSRO

and the information and documents contained in the exhibits required to be submitted with Form
NRSRO if the submission is made pursuant to paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of Rule 17g-1 (an update
of registration, an annual certification, or a withdrawal from registration, respectively); 1856 and
(2) electronically file or furnish, as applicable, the annual reports required by Rule 17g-3. 1857 In
the proposing release, the Commission stated that it intended that Form NRSRO would be an
electronic, fillable, form and that the exhibits would be submitted with the Form. 1858
Under the proposal, an applicant or NRSRO would continue to submit in paper format
Forms NRSRO pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Rule 17g-1 (initial applications for
registration, applications to register for an additional class of credit ratings, supplements to an
initial application or application to register for an additional class of credit ratings, and
withdrawals of initial applications or applications to register for an additional class of credit
ratings, respectively). The Commission stated in the proposing release that these materials are
appropriately received in paper form because of the iterative nature of the NRSRO registration
application process. 1859 For example, an applicant often will have a number of phone
conferences and meetings with the Commission staff during the application process to clarify the
1856

See id. at 33538. Under the proposal, the electronic submissions of Form NRSRO and the exhibits required
to be submitted with Form NRSRO would be made available to the public on EDGAR immediately upon
filing. The amendments to paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-1 referred to a Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through
9 as the submissions that would be required to be made electronically. The proposed amendments to
paragraph (e) of Rule 17g-1also referred to a Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9. However, Exhibit 1
(performance statistics) should not have been included with respect to the proposed amendments to
paragraph (e) because section 15E(b)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that NRSROs are not required to
update performance statistics if they becomes materially inaccurate, but that NRSROs must file updated
performance statistics with the annual certification. Accordingly, as adopted, the amendments to paragraph
(e) of Rule 17g-1 refer to Exhibits 2 through 9 to Form NRSRO. The proposed amendments to paragraph
(g) of Rule 17g-1 did not refer to exhibits to Form NRSRO because an NRSRO is not required to include
exhibits to Form NRSRO with a notice of withdrawal from registration under this paragraph.

1857

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33539. Under the proposal, the
electronic submission of the annual reports required under Rule 17g-3 would not be available to the public.
The information submitted under Rule 17g-3 is, and would continue to be, kept confidential to the extent
permitted by law.

information submitted in the application. These interactions may result in applicants informally
providing additional information relating to the application and informally amending or
augmenting information provided in the form and its exhibits. The Commission continues to
believe paper submissions facilitate this type of iterative process.
The Commission also proposed amending Items A.8 and A.9 of the instructions to Form
NRSRO to distinguish between Form NRSRO submissions under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of
Rule 17g-1 and submissions under paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of Rule 17g-1. 1860 Before today’s
amendments, Item A.8 provided the address of Commission headquarters as the address where a
Form NRSRO submitted under paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of Rule 17g-1 must be
submitted. 1861 The Commission proposed amending Item A.8 to add above the address a
sentence that would instruct an applicant to submit to the Commission at the address indicated
two paper copies of a Form NRSRO submitted pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of Rule
17g-1 and adding a sentence below the address providing that after registration, an NRSRO must
submit Form NRSRO electronically to the Commission in the format required by the EDGAR
Filer Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T, if the submission is made pursuant to
paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of Rule 17g-1. 1862
Before today’s amendments, Item A.9 of the Instructions to Form NRSRO provided that
a Form NRSRO will be considered furnished to the Commission on the date the Commission
receives a complete and properly executed Form NRSRO that follows all applicable instructions
for the Form. 1863 The Commission proposed amending the instruction to provide that a Form

the Commission receives a complete and properly executed Form NRSRO that follows all
applicable instructions for the Form, including the instructions in Item A.8 with respect to how a
Form NRSRO must be filed with or furnished to the Commission.1864
The Commission proposed amending Rule 17g-3 to add paragraphs (d) and (e). 1865
Proposed paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-3 would provide that the reports required by the rule must be
submitted electronically with the Commission in the format required by the EDGAR Filer
Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. 1866 In addition, because the Rule 17g-3 annual
reports are not required to be made public, the Commission proposed adding paragraph (e) to
Rule 17g-3, which would provide that information submitted on a confidential basis and for
which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to applicable Commission rules will be
accorded confidential treatment to the extent permitted by law and that confidential treatment
may be requested by marking each page “Confidential Treatment Requested” and by complying
with Commission rules governing confidential treatment. 1867
Electronic submissions using the EDGAR system are subject to Regulation S-T and the
EDGAR Filer Manual. 1868 The EDGAR Filer Manual contains detailed technical specifications
concerning EDGAR submissions and provides technical guidance concerning how to begin
making submissions on EDGAR.

One technical specification the EDGAR Filer Manual includes is the electronic
“submission type” for each submission made through the EDGAR system, and under the
proposal, the EDGAR Filer Manual and the EDGARLink software would provide for two
EDGAR electronic submission types: one for the submission of Form NRSRO and one for the
submission of the annual reports under Rule 17g-3. 1869
The Commission proposed amending Rule 101 of Regulation S-T 1870 by adding
paragraph (a)(1)(xiv). 1871 Proposed paragraph (a)(1)(xiv) would identify the Forms NRSRO and
the information and documents submitted in Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form NRSRO submitted to
the Commission under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 and the annual reports
submitted under Rule 17g-3 as submissions to the Commission that must be made in electronic
format. 1872
The Commission also proposed an amendment to Rule 201 of Regulation S-T. 1873 Rules
201 and 202 1874 of Regulation S-T address hardship exemptions from EDGAR filing
requirements, and paragraph (b) of Rule 13 of Regulation S-T 1875 addresses the related issue of
filing date adjustments. Under Rule 201, if an electronic filer experiences unanticipated
technical difficulties that prevent the timely preparation and submission of an electronic filing,

the filed paper document within six business days of the filing of the paper document. 1878
In addition, an electronic filer may apply for a continuing hardship exemption under Rule
202 of Regulation S-T if it cannot file all or part of a filing without undue burden or expense. 1879
The application must be made at least ten business days before the due date of the filing. In
contrast to the self-executing temporary hardship exemption process, a filer can obtain a
continuing hardship exemption only by submitting a written application, upon which the
Commission, or the Commission staff pursuant to delegated authority, must then act. Under
paragraph (b) of Rule 13 of Regulation S-T, if an electronic filer in good faith attempts to file a
document, but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the filer’s control, the
filer may request that the Commission grant an adjustment of the filing date.
The Commission proposed making the temporary hardship exemption in Rule 201
unavailable for the submissions of Form NRSRO and the information and documents submitted
in Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form NRSRO under paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of Rule 17g-1 and the
annual reports required under Rule 17g-3 by amending the introductory text of paragraph (a) of
Rule 201 of Regulation S-T to add this group of submissions to the list of submissions for which
the temporary hardship exemption is unavailable. 1880 An NRSRO would continue to have the
ability to apply for a continuing hardship exemption under Rule 202 if it could not submit all or

part of an application without undue burden or expense or for an adjustment of the due date
under paragraph (b) of Rule 13 if there were technical difficulties beyond the NRSRO’s control.
The Commission received three comments that addressed these proposals. 1881 One
commenter stated that it supported the proposal, and that having information available
immediately and in one location would benefit users of credit ratings by making it easier to
access information about NRSROs and to compare the information provided by different
NRSROs. 1882 An NRSRO stated that it would have no objection to the proposal, that providing
the information as PDF documents would be “the preferred and simplest” way to provide the
information, and that providing the information in XBRL or XML format would not provide
additional analytical benefit and could make it more difficult for users to access Form
NRSRO. 1883 This commenter also stated, however, that the temporary hardship exemption
should be available for electronic filings of Form NRSRO.
One NRSRO objected to the proposal, stating that the Commission “vastly overstated the
benefits and understated the costs” of the proposal. 1884 The commenter stated that having the
public information available immediately and in one place would not be useful to users of credit
ratings, as the information is not time-sensitive and it is relatively easy to retrieve the
information from the NRSROs’ websites. This commenter also stated that the Commission did
not estimate “the expense an NRSRO would incur in compiling Form NRSRO, its exhibits, and
the annual reports into an EDGAR-acceptable format” and that the Commission underestimated
the costs of becoming familiar with Regulation S-T and the EDGAR Filer Manual and other

1881

“start-up tasks” as well as ongoing expenses. In addition, the commenter stated that requiring
that the documents be submitted in XBRL format would increase costs without conferring
benefits. The commenter suggested, alternatively, that NRSROs be required to make the
submissions as PDF documents via electronic mail to a designated Commission e-mail address,
with confidential information encrypted before transmission.
The Commission is adopting the amendments to Rule 17g-1, Form NRSRO, Rule 17g-3,
and Regulation S-T substantially as proposed, with modifications, in response to comment. 1885
The amendments specify that the information that is required to be submitted to the Commission
electronically on EDGAR be submitted as PDF documents and, in contrast to the proposal, make
the temporary hardship exemption in Rule 201 of Regulation S-T available for these
submissions.
In response to the comment objecting to the proposal, stating that the Commission
underestimated the costs and overstated the benefits of the proposal, and stating that the
Commission should instead require that NRSROs e-mail the submissions as PDF documents to
the Commission,1886 the final amendments provide that the submissions must be made as PDF
documents, which another NRSRO described as “the most preferred and simplest” way to
provide the information. 1887 However, in response to this comment, as explained below in the
economic analysis, the Commission has increased its estimate of the cost of the proposal. In
addition, as explained below in the economic analysis, the Commission agrees with another

1887

See S&P Letter.

484

commenter that the amendments will benefit users of credit ratings 1888 and also that the
amendments will benefit NRSROs and Commission staff.
Accordingly, the amendments to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1, as adopted,
provide that a Form NRSRO and the information and documents in the exhibits required to be
submitted with the form must be filed electronically with the Commission on EDGAR as a PDF
document in the format required by the EDGAR Filer Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of
Regulation S-T. 1889 Similarly, amended Item A.8 to the Instructions for Form NRSRO has been
modified from the proposal to provide that an NRSRO must make these submissions
“electronically on EDGAR as a PDF document in the format required by the EDGAR Filer
Manual as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T.” 1890 The amendments to Instruction A.9 to
Form NRSRO, to include a reference to the instructions in Item A.8, are adopted as proposed. 1891
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-3 has similarly been modified from the proposal to provide
that the reports must be filed with or furnished to, as applicable, the Commission electronically
on EDGAR as PDF documents in the format required by the EDGAR Filer Manual, as defined in
Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. 1892 Paragraph (e) of Rule 17g-3 is adopted as proposed. 1893
Rule 104 of Regulation S-T 1894 provides for “unofficial PDF copies” that are included in
electronic submissions through EDGAR. Under the amendments, however, the electronic
submissions will be “official” filings with the Commission. Accordingly, as adopted, paragraph
(xiv) of Regulation S-T adds Form NRSRO and the information and documents in Exhibits 1

paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 and the annual reports filed with or furnished to, as
applicable, the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3 as documents that must be filed
electronically with the Commission; that the documents must be filed or furnished on EDGAR as
PDF documents in the format required by the EDGAR Filer Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of
Regulation S-T; and that notwithstanding Rule 104 of Regulation S-T , the PDF documents filed
or furnished pursuant to this paragraph will be considered as officially filed with or furnished to,
as applicable, the Commission. 1895
Finally, the Commission is modifying the proposal in response to comment, 1896 to make
the temporary hardship exemption in Rule 201 available for the submissions of Form NRSRO
and the information and documents submitted in the exhibits that must be filed with the form
under paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of Rule 17g-1 and the annual reports required under Rule 17g-3.
Accordingly, if an NRSRO has unanticipated technical difficulties beyond its control, such as a
power outage or equipment failure, that prevent the timely preparation and submission of an
electronic submission, the NRSRO may make the submission in paper form under the temporary
hardship exemption under cover of Form TH no later than one business day after the submission
was to be made. The NRSRO must submit an electronic copy within six business days of the
submission of the paper document. This should mitigate the burden for an NRSRO that
experiences a technical problem.
2.

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the specific amendments
1895

See paragraph (a)(1)(xiv) of Rule 101 of Regulation S-T.

1896

See S&P Letter.

486

relating to the requirement that NRSROs make certain submissions to the Commission
electronically. 1897 The baseline that existed before today’s amendments was one in which, as
discussed above, applicants for registration as an NRSRO and NRSROs were required to submit
Form NRSRO to the Commission in paper form. 1898 In addition, NRSROs were required to
submit their annual reports under Rule 17g-3 in paper form. 1899 NRSROs were also required
under paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 to make the public portions of their most recent Forms
NRSRO publicly available within ten business days after submission to the Commission (or, in
the case of an application for registration as an NRSRO or for an additional class of credit
ratings, within ten business days after a Commission order granting such an application), and did
so by posting electronic copies of their current Forms NRSRO and Exhibits 1 to 9 to these forms
on their public websites. Investors interested in comparing the content of these forms across all
NRSROs could visit each of the individual NRSRO websites to locate the forms, or use direct
hyperlinks to the relevant web pages published on the Commission’s website. 1900
Relative to the baseline, the amendments may provide benefits to users of credit ratings.
In the proposing release, the Commission preliminarily identified potential benefits resulting
from the proposed amendments. 1901 As discussed above, one commenter stated that having the
information available immediately and in one location would benefit users of credit ratings by
making it easier to access information about NRSROs and to compare the information provided

by different NRSROs. 1902 However, an NRSRO commented that the Commission “vastly
overstated” the benefits of the proposal. 1903 In response, the Commission more specifically
identifies the sources of expected benefits in this release.
The electronic submission of Form NRSRO will allow the Commission to make the
public portions of the Form NRSRO of each NRSRO publicly available on EDGAR immediately
upon submission. Moreover, past submissions of Form NRSRO on the EDGAR system will
remain available even after updated versions are submitted, benefitting users of credit ratings
relative to the baseline by maintaining the availability of historical data that they may find useful
in evaluating and comparing NRSROs. 1904 The Commission believes that the availability of
these forms on EDGAR may also marginally benefit users of credit ratings by reducing the time
and effort required to retrieve Forms NRSRO, since they will be consolidated in a single location
rather than located on separate websites, and potentially reducing (by up to ten days, given the
time allowed for NRSROs to post these forms on their websites) the delay before the forms are
made publicly available. One NRSRO commented that users of credit ratings would be “far
more likely” to continue to access Forms NRSRO from NRSRO websites instead of EDGAR,
given that they may use these websites to access other useful information. 1905 In response, the
Commission notes that Forms NRSRO are likely to be a helpful starting point for evaluating and
comparing NRSROs.
The Commission believes that the electronic submission of the Forms NRSRO and the
Rule 17g-3 annual reports may marginally benefit NRSROs because they will avoid the

See section II.E.4. of this release (discussing the limitations of interpreting performance statistics computed
using the single cohort approach using only the most current Forms NRSRO, since these forms would only

488

uncertainties, delay, and expense related to the physical delivery of multiple paper copies of the
submissions.
The Commission believes that the requirement that Forms NRSRO and the Rule 17g-3
annual reports be submitted through the EDGAR system may promote efficiency. As stated
above, the availability of the public portions of Forms NRSRO on EDGAR will provide a
centralized location for users of credit ratings to access these disclosures. The electronic
submission of Forms NRSRO, including the confidential portions of these forms, and the annual
reports, which will not be made public, will also assist the Commission staff in storing and
accessing these records in furtherance of the Commission’s NRSRO oversight function. To the
extent that the ready access to the public portions of the current and, in the future, previous
Forms NRSRO on EDGAR improves the ability of users of credit ratings to evaluate and
compare NRSROs, the electronic submission requirement may also indirectly enhance
competition. 1906
These amendments will result in compliance costs to NRSROs, including costs to gain
access to and become familiar with the EDGAR system. In the proposing release, the
Commission stated that it believed that the initial costs to become familiar with the EDGAR
system and adopt processes for using the system would be minimal and that the annual costs
would be no greater than the costs attributable to paper submissions. 1907 One NRSRO
commented that the Commission understated the initial costs of the proposal as “an NRSRO will
have to familiarize itself with the roughly 35 Rules of Regulation S-T as well as the first two
volumes of the EDGAR Filer Manual (which currently total more than 600 pages) and related

See section I.B.3. of this release (providing a broader discussion of the potential impacts of the
amendments and new rules on efficiency, competition, and capital formation).

489

EDGAR technical guidance.” 1908 However, the commenter did not provide a different estimate
of the cost associated with the proposal. 1909 In response to this comment, the Commission notes
that not all of Regulation S-T or the EDGAR Filer Manual applies to NRSRO submissions. In
addition, the Commission has published on its website staff guidance for EDGAR filers and staff
answers to frequently asked questions that may reduce the time required for NRSROs to
familiarize themselves with the EDGAR system. Nonetheless, as discussed in section IV.D.1. of
this release, the Commission has revised its estimate of the time required for an NRSRO to
become familiar with the EDGAR system. The same commenter also stated that the
Commission failed to consider the significant annual costs of monitoring changes in EDGAR
filing requirements, but the commenter did not provide an estimate of these costs. 1910 In
response, the Commission has added an estimated annual burden attributable to monitoring
changes in EDGAR filing requirements. 1911

The Commission’s estimates of these costs are

provided below.
As discussed above, the Commission has also modified the requirement to submit certain
Forms NRSRO and annual reports under Rule 17g-3 to the Commission electronically. One
NRSRO described documents in PDF format as “the most preferred and simplest” way to
provide the information. 1912 Another NRSRO commented that submission formats other than
PDF would require “very expensive” reformatting and, because NRSROs post PDF versions of
Form NRSRO on their websites, would result in costs of “producing two sets of these documents

490

in two different electronic formats on an ongoing basis.” 1913 In response to these comments, the
Commission has modified the proposed amendments to require that the electronic submissions
be made on EDGAR as PDF documents.
Based on analysis for purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that the
amendments to Rule 17g-1, Form NRSRO, Rule 17g-3, and Regulation S-T regarding electronic
submission of certain Forms NRSRO and NRSRO annual reports under Rule 17g-3 will result in
total industry-wide one-time costs to NRSROs of approximately $46,000 and total industry-wide
annual costs to NRSROs of approximately $6,000. 1914
As discussed above, the Commission has modified the proposal to make the temporary
hardship exemption available to NRSROs. Because the temporary hardship exemption process
is self-executing, the Commission expects that any costs borne by NRSROs when availing of the
temporary hardship exemption, including the cost to make the submission in paper form under
the cover of Form TH, will be de minimis. Also, given that the Commission has simplified the
technical requirements for the submissions by requiring PDF rather than XML or XBRL
documents, and that the temporary hardship exemption will be available if an NRSRO
nonetheless experiences unanticipated technical difficulties that prevent the timely preparation
and submission of an electronic filing, the Commission does not expect NRSROs to apply for
continuing hardship exemptions.
As discussed above, one reasonable alternative to the Commission’s approach would be
to require that the electronic submissions be made in XBRL or XML format. Two NRSROs
stated that such formats would not provide incremental benefits, while one of these commenters

See section V.N. of this release (discussing implementation and annual compliance considerations). The
one-time and annual costs are determined by monetizing internal hour burdens and adding external costs

491

stated that requiring such formats “would substantially increase an NRSRO’s costs” and the
other noted that “a detailed technical analysis would need to be performed to determine the impact
and any associated costs.” 1915 However, one commenter suggested that requiring Exhibit 1 to Form
NRSRO in particular to be submitted in XML or XBRL format would benefit investors, regulators,
and other market participants. 1916 While the Commission agrees that submissions in these formats
may benefit certain users of credit ratings by facilitating the comparative analysis of the quantitative
data in the forms over time and across NRSROs, the Commission is sensitive to the concerns raised
by NRSROs and has determined not to impose at this time a requirement that the submissions be
made in XML or XBRL formats, in part to limit the additional compliance costs that would be borne
by NRSROs. One NRSRO suggested that PDF copies of the required submissions should be

transmitted via e-mail, with the confidential submissions being encrypted before
transmission. 1917 While such an approach may reduce the compliance costs associated with
electronic submission, the Commission believes that the costs of using the EDGAR system are
balanced by the benefits discussed above of using this system not only for delivery of electronic
submissions to the Commission, but also for the dissemination and storage of these submissions.
M.

OTHER AMENDMENTS

The Commission proposed additional amendments to several NRSRO rules in response
to amendments the Dodd-Frank Act made to sections of the Exchange Act that authorize or
otherwise are relevant to these rules and to clarify certain provisions of the NRSRO rules. 1918
The Commission is adopting these amendments as proposed. 1919

The Commission is also making a technical amendment to paragraphs (e) and (f) of Rule 17g-1 to replace

492

1.

Changing “Furnish” to “File”

Before the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Exchange Act contained provisions
requiring NRSROs to “furnish” certain items to the Commission. For example, section 15E(k)
of the Exchange Act required NRSROs to “furnish” financial information to the Commission. 1920
Section 932(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended several Exchange Act provisions relating to
NRSROs to replace the word “furnish” with the word “file” in section 15E(b) (which addresses
NRSRO submission of updates of registration and annual certifications to the Commission);
section 15E(d) (which addresses Commission sanctions on NRSROs); section 15E(k) (which
addresses NRSRO submission of financial information to the Commission); and section 15E(l)
(which provides that registration under section 15E of the Exchange Act is the sole method of
registration as an NRSRO). 1921 For example, section 15E(b)(2), as amended, provides that an
NRSRO shall “file” its annual certification with the Commission. In accordance with the DoddFrank Act amendment to section 15E(b) of the Exchange Act, the Commission proposed
amending paragraphs (e) and (f) of Rule 17g-1, which address the submission of updates of
registration and annual certifications, respectively, to require that the Forms NRSRO submitted
to the Commission under those provisions be filed with, rather than furnished to, the
Commission.1922 Similarly, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act amendment to section
15E(k) of the Exchange Act, the Commission proposed amending paragraphs (a)(1) through
the phrase “Exhibits…of Form NRSRO” to the phrase “Exhibits…to Form NRSRO” for consistency with
paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 and a technical amendment to paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 to replace the word
“paragraphs” with the word “paragraph.”
1920

See Pub. L. No. 109-291, 4(a) (adding section 15E to the Exchange Act).

1921

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, 932(a); 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(b), (d), (k), and (l). Among other things, an application,
report, or document “filed” with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act or rules under the
Exchange Act is subject to the provisions of section 18 of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7r. As
explained below, however, the Dodd-Frank Act did not replace all references in Exchange Act provisions
relating to NRSROs from “furnish” to “file.”

493

(a)(5) of Rule 17g-3 to require that the reports submitted to the Commission under those
provisions be filed with, rather than furnished to, the Commission.1923
The Dodd-Frank Act, however, did not replace the word “furnish” with the word “file” in
sections 15E(a) and 15E(e) of the Exchange Act (which address the submission of initial
applications for registration as an NRSRO and the submission of voluntary withdrawals from
registration, respectively), or in section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act (which provides the
Commission with authority to, among other things, require NRSROs to furnish reports to the
Commission).1924
The Commission stated in the proposing release that it preliminarily believed that the
failure to replace the word “furnish” with the word “file” in section 15E(a) of the Exchange Act
was an inadvertent omission. 1925 For example, section 15E(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, refers to information “required to be filed” under section
15E(a)(1)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act (emphasis added). 1926 Similarly, section 15E(d)(1)(B) of
the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, refers to “the date on which an
application for registration is filed with the Commission” (emphasis added). 1927 In addition, the
legislative history of section 932(a) states that “[Title IX, Subtitle C, of the Dodd-Frank Act]
requires all references to ‘furnish’ be replaced with the word ‘file’ in existing law.” 1928
Consequently, the Commission proposed amending paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Rule 17g-1

1923

See id. at 33539. The Commission adopted paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of Rule 17g-3 under section
15E(k). See Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating

(which address initial applications for registration as an NRSRO, applications to register for an
additional class of credit ratings, and supplementing an application, respectively) to substitute the
words “file with the Commission two paper copies of” in place of the words “furnish the
Commission with.” 1929
The Commission did not propose replacing the word “furnish” with the word “file” in
paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-1 (which addresses the withdrawal of an application for registration)
or in paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-1 (which addresses the submission of voluntary withdrawals
from registration). 1930 Consequently, as proposed, when referencing the submission of Form
NRSRO to the Commission, paragraphs (h) and (i) of Rule 17g-1 (which include provisions
relating to when a Form NRSRO will be considered filed with or furnished to the Commission
and the public availability of Form NRSRO, respectively) would use phrases such as “filing with
or furnishing to, as applicable.” 1931
The Commission also did not propose to amend paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17g-3 to treat
the report identified in that paragraph (an unaudited report of the number of credit rating actions
taken during the fiscal year) as a filing. That paragraph was adopted under section 17(a)(1) of
the Exchange Act. 1932 Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that any report an NRSRO
“is required by Commission rules under this paragraph to make and disseminate to the
Commission shall be deemed furnished to the Commission.” 1933 As stated above, the DoddFrank Act did not amend this provision.

The Commission proposed amending Form NRSRO and the instructions to Form
NRSRO to conform the form and its instructions to the proposed amendments discussed
above. 1934 Under the proposed amendments, Form NRSRO and the Instructions to Form
NRSRO would use the word “file” instead of the word “furnish” when referring to a Form
NRSRO submitted under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e), and (f) of Rule 17g-1. In addition, in some
cases, the Commission proposed using the term “submit” when referring to a Form NRSRO that
may have been submitted prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act when the submission would
have been “furnished to” as opposed to “filed with” the Commission. The Commission intended
the word “submit” as used in this context to mean the submission was either “furnished” or
“filed” depending on the applicable securities laws in effect at the time of the submission.
The Commission did not receive comments on the proposals to amend Rule 17g-1, Rule
17g-3, Form NRSRO, and the instructions to Form NRSRO to replace the word “furnish” with
the word “file” and is adopting the amendments as proposed.

Amended Definition of NRSRO

The first prong of the definition of nationally recognized statistical rating organization in
section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act, prior to being amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provided
that the entity “has been in business as a credit rating agency for at least the 3 consecutive years
immediately preceding the date of its application for registration under section 15E.” 1935 Section
932(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act deleted this prong of the definition. 1936 Instruction F.4 to Form
NRSRO contained a definition of nationally recognized statistical rating organization that

incorporated the section 3(a)(62) definition as originally enacted. 1937 The Commission proposed
amending this definition to conform it to the section 3(a)(62) definition as amended by the DoddFrank Act. 1938
Two NRSROs supported this amendment, 1939 and the Commission is adopting it as
proposed.

Definition of Asset-Backed Security

Prior to today’s amendments, several of the Commission’s NRSRO rules had
requirements that were specific to credit ratings for structured finance products by providing that
the rules apply to credit ratings with respect to “a security or money market instrument issued by
an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities transaction.” 1940 This
text mirrors the text of section 15E(i) of the Exchange Act, which provides the Commission with
authority to prohibit an NRSRO from the practice of “lowering or threatening to lower a credit
rating on, or refusing to rate, securities or money market instruments issued by an asset pool or
as part of any asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities transaction, unless a portion of the
assets within such pool or part of such transaction, as applicable, also is rated by the
[NRSRO].” 1941 The Commission has provided the following interpretation with respect to this
text in its rules:
The term “structured finance product” as used throughout this release refers broadly to
any security or money market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset1937

This instruction, “Explanation of Terms,” was numbered as “Instruction F” before today’s amendments. It
should have been numbered as “Instruction I.”

backed or mortgage-backed securities transaction. This broad category of financial
instrument includes, but is not limited to, asset-backed securities such as residential
mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and to other types of structured debt instruments
such as collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), including synthetic and hybrid CDOs,
or collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). 1942
Section 941(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended section 3 of the Exchange Act to add
paragraph (a)(79), which defines the term asset-backed security. 1943 The Exchange Act
definition of asset-backed security includes a “collateralized mortgage obligation.” 1944
Consequently, the Commission stated in the proposing release that the current identification of
structured finance products in the Commission’s rules (namely, “a security or money market
instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities
transaction”) may have redundant terms because the new definition of asset-backed security in
section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act as an “asset-backed securities transaction” would include a
“mortgage-backed securities transaction.” 1945 Consequently, the Commission stated in the
proposing release that it preliminarily believed that the inclusion of the term “mortgage-backed
securities transactions” in certain of the Commission’s NRSRO rules may be redundant. 1946 The
Commission therefore proposed deleting the term “or mortgage-backed” from the identification
of structured finance products in these rules. 1947 One NRSRO supported the proposal, 1948 and

Other Amendments to Form NRSRO

The Commission proposed clarifying amendments to Form NRSRO to better ensure that
disclosures on Form NRSRO are consistent across applicants and NRSROs. 1950
a.

Clarification with Respect to Items 6 and 7

Items 6 and 7 of Form NRSRO elicit information concerning the number of credit ratings
an applicant or NRSRO has outstanding in each class of credit ratings for which the applicant is
applying to be registered or for which the NRSRO is registered, respectively. 1951 Item 6 applies
to initial applications for registration as an NRSRO, application supplements, and applications to
add a class of credit ratings. Item 7 applies for updates of registration, annual certifications,
withdrawals from registration, and applications to add a class of credit ratings. The classes of
credit ratings for which an NRSRO can be registered are: (1) financial institutions, brokers, or
dealers; 1952 (2) insurance companies; 1953 (3) corporate issuers; 1954 (4) issuers of asset-backed
securities (as that term is defined in section 1101(c) of part 229 of Title 17, Code of Federal
Regulations, “as in effect on the date of enactment of this paragraph”); 1955 and (5) issuers of
government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign government. 1956

NRSROs have raised questions about how they should count the number of credit ratings
outstanding in a given class of credit ratings for the purposes of Form NRSRO. 1957 For example,
the GAO has found that some NRSROs counted the number of issuers rated but not the number
of securities or money market instruments rated, some NRSROs counted the number of securities
or money market instruments rated and excluded the number of rated obligors in the total, and
some NRSROs counted the number of obligors, securities, and money market instruments
rated. 1958
The Commission’s intent in Items 6 and 7 is to elicit the total number of obligors,
securities, and money market instruments in a given class of credit ratings for which the
applicant or NRSRO has assigned a credit rating that was outstanding as of the applicable date
(the date of the application in the case of Item 6 and the date of the most recent calendar yearend in the case of Item 7). Consequently, the Commission proposed amending Items 6.A and
7.A of Form NRSRO to specify that an applicant or NRSRO must provide the “approximate
number of obligors, securities, and money market instruments” for each class of credit ratings for
which the applicant or NRSRO has an outstanding credit rating. 1959
In addition, the Commission proposed amending Instruction H to Form NRSRO (as it
relates to Items 6.A and 7.A) in four ways. 1960 First, in conformity with the proposed
amendments to the text of Items 6.A and 7.A in the Form, the instructions would be amended to
provide that the applicant or NRSRO must, for each class of credit ratings, provide in the
appropriate box the approximate number of obligors, securities, and money market instruments

in that class for which the applicant or NRSRO presently has a credit rating outstanding as of the
date of the application (Item 6.A) or had a credit rating outstanding as of the most recently ended
calendar year (Item 7.A).
Second, Instruction H was proposed to be amended to provide that the applicant or
NRSRO must treat as a separately rated security or money market instrument each individually
rated security and money market instrument that, for example, is assigned a distinct CUSIP or
other unique identifier, has distinct credit enhancement features as compared with other
securities or money market instruments of the same issuer, or has a different maturity date as
compared with other securities or money market instruments of the same issuer. 1961 This
proposed instruction was designed to clarify that each security or money market instrument of an
issuer must be included in the count if it is assigned a credit rating by the applicant or NRSRO.
For example, if the issuer is in the structured finance class, each tranche of the structured finance
product that is assigned a credit rating must be included in the count. In addition, if an issuer
issues securities or money market instruments that have different maturities, the applicant or
NRSRO must include each such security in the count if the NRSRO assigns a credit rating to the
security or money market instrument.
Third, Instruction H was proposed to be amended to provide that the applicant or NRSRO
must not include an obligor, security, or money market instrument in more than one class of
credit rating. 1962 In other words, the applicant or NRSRO cannot double count an obligor,
security, or money market instrument by including it in the totals for two or more classes of
credit ratings. For example, some securities have characteristics that could cause an applicant or

1961

See id.

1962

See id.

501

NRSRO to classify them as municipal securities or structured finance products. 1963 Nonetheless,
under the proposed amendment, the applicant or NRSRO would need to select the most
appropriate class for the security or money market instrument and include it in the count for that
class.
Fourth, Instruction H was proposed to be amended to provide that the applicant or
NRSRO must include in the class of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv) of the
Exchange Act (issuers of asset-backed securities), to the extent not described in section
3(a)(62)(B)(iv), any rated security or money market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part
of any asset-backed securities transaction. 1964 Section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv) contains a narrower
definition of asset-backed security than the Commission uses for the purposes of its NRSRO
rules. 1965 In fact, the definition is narrower than the new definition of asset-backed security in
section 3(a)(79) of the Exchange Act. 1966 The Commission intends an applicant and an NRSRO
to use the broader definition that captures all structured finance products when providing the
number of credit ratings outstanding in this class. The proposed amendments to Instruction H to
Form NRSRO were designed to make this intention more clear.
Two NRSROs supported the proposed amendments to Items 6 and 7 of Form NRSRO
and the related Instructions to Form NRSRO. 1967 The Commission is adopting them as
proposed.

1963

For example, tax exempt housing bonds share characteristics of both municipal securities and structured
finance products.

502

Because some obligors, securities, and money market instruments have characteristics
that could cause them to be assigned to more than one class of credit rating, the Commission
sought comment on which class would be the most appropriate for these types of obligors,
securities, and money market instruments. For example, the Commission requested comment on
how tax-exempt housing bonds should be classified for purposes of Items 6 and 7 of Form
NRSRO. 1968 Several NRSROs provided comment in response to this request. 1969 One NRSRO
stated that the Commission should create a new subclass of credit ratings under the insurance
company class to distinguish traditional insurance companies from the special-purpose vehicles
set up solely to provide reinsurance to insurance carriers. 1970 Two NRSROs stated that taxexempt housing bonds should be classified in the category for issuers of government securities;
supra-national issuers should be classified in the category for issuers of government securities;
and covered bonds should be classified in the category for financial institutions. 1971 One
NRSRO stated that if a municipality issues securities on behalf of a for-profit healthcare
company, the securities should be classified as government securities, and that securitizations of
healthcare receivables and insurance-linked securities are both typically classified in the assetbacked security category. 1972 Another NRSRO stated that covered bonds that are effectively
“repackaged” should be classified as issuers of asset-backed securities; that healthcare revenue
bonds or industrial revenue bonds should be classified as corporate securities; that insurancelinked securities should be classified as insurance companies; that energy prepay transactions

should be classified as a corporate issuer; and that Airline Enhanced Equipment Trust
Certificates should be classified as corporate debt. 1973
Given the complexity of trying to classify every type of obligor, security, or money
market instrument that potentially could straddle two or more classes of credit ratings, the
Commission is deferring making specific classifications for purposes of Items 6 and 7 of Form
NRSRO. Instead, an NRSRO should make reasonable and consistent judgments about the
classification of these types of obligors, securities, and money instruments.
b.

Clarification with Respect to Exhibit 8

The Commission proposed amending Instruction H to Form NRSRO as it relates to
Exhibit 8. 1974 Exhibit 8 requires an applicant or NRSRO to provide the number of credit analysts
it employs and the number of its credit analyst supervisors. The Commission proposed two
amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 8. The first amendment would delete a parenthesis
that instructs the applicant or NRSRO to “see definition below” of the term credit analyst
because that term is not defined in the Form. The second amendment would clarify that the
applicant or NRSRO, in providing the number of its credit analysts, should include the number
of its credit analyst supervisors. This was designed to ensure that the disclosures in Form
NRSRO are consistent across applicants and NRSROs. 1975
One NRSRO stated that it supported the proposal to amend Instruction H as it relates to
Exhibit 8 to Form NRSRO, 1976 and the Commission is adopting it as proposed.

c.

Clarification with Respect to Exhibits 10 through 13

Before today’s amendments, paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 required an NRSRO to make its
current Form NRSRO and information and documents submitted in Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form
NRSRO publicly available on its Internet website, or through another comparable, readily
accessible means within ten business days after the date of the Commission order granting an
initial application for registration or an application to register for an additional class of credit
ratings and within ten business days after submitting a Form NRSRO under paragraph (e), (f), or
(g) of Rule 17g-1 (an update of registration, an annual certification, or a withdrawal from
registration). 1977 An NRSRO is not required to make Exhibits 10 through 13 to Form NRSRO
publicly available or update them after registration. Instead, an NRSRO must provide similar
information in the annual reports required to be filed with the Commission under Rule 17g-3. 1978
In the past, some NRSROs have submitted the annual reports required by Rule 17g-3 in the form
of Exhibits 10 through 13, on a confidential basis, as part of the annual certification.
Consequently, the Commission proposed amending Instruction H as it relates to Exhibits 10
through 13 to add a “Note” instructing that after registration, Exhibits 10 through 13 should not
be updated with the filing of the annual certification, but that similar information must be filed
with the Commission not more than ninety days after the end of each fiscal year under Rule 17g3. 1979
One NRSRO supported the proposal to amend Instruction H as it relates to Exhibits 10
through 13 to Form NRSRO, 1980 and the Commission is adopting it as proposed.

Economic Analysis

This section builds on the economic analysis in section I.B. of this release by presenting a
focused analysis of the potential economic effects that may derive from the additional
amendments to several NRSRO rules made in response to amendments the Dodd-Frank Act
made to sections of the Exchange Act that authorize or otherwise are relevant to these rules and
to clarify certain provisions of the NRSRO rules. 1981 Many of these amendments clarify what is
required of NRSROs by making terms in Commission rules applicable to NRSROs consistent
with the amendments that the Dodd-Frank Act made to terms in section 15E of the Exchange
Act. These clarifying amendments – including the replacement of “furnish” with “file” with
respect to updates of registration and annual certifications and the amended definitions of
nationally recognized statistical rating organization and asset-backed security – should result in
no incremental costs and may benefit NRSROs by removing the potential ambiguity caused by
inconsistent terms.
As discussed above, beyond these clarifying amendments made for consistency with
section 15E of the Exchange Act, the Commission has adopted amendments to replace the word
“furnish” with the word “file” in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Rule 17g-1 (which address initial
applications for registration as an NRSRO, applications to register for an additional class of
credit ratings, and supplementing an application, respectively) based on its belief, as stated in the
proposing release, that the failure to make this replacement in section 15E(a) of the Exchange
Act was an inadvertent omission and that the legislative history of the Dodd-Frank Act states that
the statute requires all references to “furnish” to be replaced with “file.” 1982 These replacements

1981

The economic analysis in section I.B. of this release discusses the primary economic impacts that may
derive from the amendments and new rules being adopted today.

506

of “furnish” with “file” may cause applicants for registration as an NRSRO and NRSROs
applying to register for an additional class of credit ratings to take the same care in composing
these applications as they would in any updates of registration and annual certifications (which
are required to be “filed” under the baseline), given that section 18 of the Exchange Act imposes
liability for material misstatements or omissions contained in reports and other information filed
with the Commission, which may result in marginal incremental costs to these applicants.
The amendments discussed in section II.M.4. of this release regarding clarifications to the
instructions to Form NRSRO should benefit users of credit ratings. The use by NRSROs of
different approaches to computing the numbers of outstanding credit ratings, credit rating
analysts, and credit rating analyst supervisors reported in Form NRSRO – without disclosing the
method employed – has made it difficult to interpret and compare these numbers in the past. 1983
The amendments therefore will improve the ability of users of credit ratings to interpret this
information regarding the breadth of NRSRO coverage and NRSRO staffing and compare the
information across NRSROs. Also, the amendments will allow the Commission to develop a
clearer picture of the NRSROs and their activities and thus facilitate the Commission’s oversight,
which may indirectly lead to enhancements in the quality of credit ratings to the benefit of users
of credit ratings. The amendments may impose one-time costs on NRSROs because they may
need to adjust their calculations of their numbers of outstanding credit ratings, credit rating
analysts, and credit rating analyst supervisors. However, the Commission believes these costs
will be de minimis.

1983

See, e.g., GAO Report 10-782, p. 46-47. In its review of the disclosure of outstanding credit ratings, the
GAO concluded that “[b]ecause of the inconsistencies in how the NRSROs count their total outstanding
ratings, users cannot rely on the disclosures to assess how broad an NRSRO’s coverage is within a
particular class of credit ratings.” The GAO also found that NRSROs did not disclose the methodologies
applied to count credit ratings, “so users have no way of knowing that these differences exist.”

507

III.

EFFECTIVE DATES
As discussed below, the Commission is establishing effective dates for the amendments

to existing rules and new rules that are intended to take into account the period of time NRSROs,
issuers, underwriters, and providers of third-party due diligence services will need in order to
establish new, or adapt existing, policies, procedures, controls, systems, standards, and practices
to comply with the new requirements. If any provision of these amendments or new rules, or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not
affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances that
can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
A.

AMENDMENTS EFFECTIVE SIXTY DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION IN
THE FEDERAL REGISTER

The following amendments to existing rules are effective sixty days after this release is
published in the Federal Register: the amendment to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T; the
amendments to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1; and new paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-3.
These amendments require Form NRSRO and applicable exhibits (in the case of an update of
registration, an annual certification, or a withdrawal from registration) and the annual reports
under Rule 17g-3 to be submitted to the Commission electronically as PDF documents using the
Commission’s EDGAR system. However, these Forms NRSRO (and applicable exhibits) and
the annual reports should continue to be submitted to the Commission in paper form until the
Commission provides notice that the EDGAR system is ready to receive the forms and reports
and specifies a date on or after which the forms and reports must be submitted through the
EDGAR system.
Also effective sixty days after publication in the Federal Register are: (1) the
amendments to paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e), and (f) of Rule 17g-1 and paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2),
508

(a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of Rule 17g-3 replacing the word “furnish” with the word “file;” (2) the
amendments to paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Rule 17g-1 requiring two paper copies of
submissions; the amendment to paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 requiring NRSROs to make Form
NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 freely available on an easily accessible portion of their
corporate Internet websites and to provide a paper copy of Exhibit 1 to individuals who request a
paper copy; (3) the amendments to paragraphs (a)(2)(iii), (a)(7), and (b)(9) of Rule 17g-2, the
note to paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17g-3, paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(9) of Rule 17g-5, and
paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17g-6, which delete the term “or mortgage-backed” from the
identification of structured finance products; (4) new paragraph (b)(12) of Rule 17g-2, which
identifies the internal control structure an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and
document under section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act as a record that must be retained; (5)
the amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2, which identifies each record an NRSRO must
retain until three years after it is replaced with an updated record; (6) the amendment to
paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-2, which repeals paragraph (d)(2) (the 10% Rule); (7) new paragraph
(a)(8) of Rule 17g-3, which identifies the annual report of the designated compliance officer as
one of the unaudited reports that must be filed with the Commission under that rule; (8) new
paragraph (e) of Rule 17g-3, which relates to information submitted on a confidential basis and
for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to applicable Commission rules; (9)
new paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5, which provides that upon written application by an NRSRO,
the Commission may exempt, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, the
NRSRO from paragraph (c)(8) if the Commission finds that due to the small size of the NRSRO
it is not appropriate to require the separation of the production of credit ratings from sales and
marketing activities and the exemption is in the public interest; (10) new paragraph (g) of Rule

509

17g-5, which provides for penalties the Commission may impose on an NRSRO in a proceeding
in which the Commission finds that the NRSRO has violated rules under section 15E(h) of the
Exchange Act and the violation affected a credit rating; and (11) the amendments to paragraphs
(h) and (i) of Rule 17g-1, paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(11) of Rule 17g-2, paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2),
(a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (b)(1) of Rule 17g-3 and the heading thereof, and paragraphs
(a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii), (a)(3)(iii)(A), (a)(3)(iii)(B), (a)(3)(iii)(C), (a)(3)(iii)(D), and (e) of Rule 17g5, which are minor amendments such as wording changes. The Commission did not receive
comments specifically addressing the effective date for these amendments and does not believe
that additional time is needed in order to prepare for the changes that will result from these
amendments.
B.

AMENDMENTS EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015

The Commission is delaying the effective date for new paragraphs (a)(7) and (b)(2) of
Rule 17g-3 and the amendments to Form NRSRO until January 1, 2015. The Commission
intends that the practical effect of having these amendments become effective on January 1, 2015
is that the first internal controls report required to be submitted by an NRSRO will cover the
fiscal year that ends on or after January 1, 2015, and the first annual certification on Form
NRSRO that follows the amended instructions for Exhibit 1 relating to performance statistics and
the amended instructions to Item 7.A relating to the number of credit ratings outstanding will be
required for the annual certifications filed after the end of the 2015 calendar year.
Paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 requires an NRSRO to include an additional report – a
report on the NRSRO’s internal control structure established under section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the
Exchange Act – with its annual submission of reports to the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3,
and paragraph (b)(2) requires the NRSRO’s CEO or, if the firm does not have a CEO, an

510

individual performing similar functions to provide a signed statement that must be attached to the
report.
One NRSRO stated that the Commission should not require the internal controls report to
be submitted until “the Commission publishes its guidance and provides a reasonable time for
the implementation of this guidance to be completed and timely exam feedback is provided.” 1984
The Commission notes that, in addition to the guidance provided above in section II.A.3. of this
release, the final amendment provides more specificity than the proposed rule as to the
information that must be included in the internal controls report in terms of assessing the
effectiveness of the NRSRO’s internal control structure. Moreover, the final amendment
specifies when the NRSRO is not permitted to conclude that its internal control structure is
effective and includes a description of when a material weakness exists, which will provide
greater certainty to NRSROs in terms of how to assess the effectiveness of the internal control
structure. The delayed effective date will provide NRSROs with time to prepare processes to
obtain the evidentiary matter necessary to make the assessments necessary to support the
information that must be provided in the report. Consequently, an NRSRO must begin filing
with the Commission an annual internal controls report no later than ninety calendar days after
the end of the NRSRO’s fiscal year that ends on or after January 1, 2015. 1985

Based on the most recent submissions of Form NRSRO, eight of the NRSROs have December 31 fiscal
year ends. Consequently, for these firms, the first internal controls report of the NRSRO must be filed no
later than ninety days after December 31, 2015. One NRSRO has a fiscal year end of November 30 and,
consequently, the first internal controls report for this firm must be filed no later than ninety days after
November 30, 2015. Another NRSRO has a fiscal year end of March 31 and, consequently, the first
internal controls report for this firm must be filed no later than ninety days after March 31, 2015. If an
NRSRO’s fiscal year ends in 2015 before December 31, the NRSRO may submit an internal controls report
for that fiscal year that covers the period beginning on January 1, 2015 through the end of the NRSRO’s
then-current fiscal year. Alternatively, the NRSRO may instead elect to have the report cover its entire
fiscal year. See Frequently Asked Questions Concerning the July 30, 2013 Amendments to the BrokerDealer Financial Reporting Rule (Apr. 4, 2014), available at

The amendments to Form NRSRO include the following: (1) the amendment to the
instructions for Form NRSRO adding new Instruction A.10, which provides notice to credit
rating agencies applying for registration as NRSROs, and NRSROs, that an NRSRO is subject to
the fine and penalty provisions and other available sanctions in sections 15E, 21, 21A, 21B, 21C,
and 32 of the Exchange Act for violations of the securities laws; (2) the amendment to the
instructions for Form NRSRO requiring that Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form
NRSRO, as applicable, under paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of Rule 17g-1 (an update of registration,
an annual certification, or a withdrawal from registration, respectively) be submitted to the
Commission electronically as PDF documents using the Commission’s EDGAR system; 1986 (3)
the clarifying amendments with respect to Items 6 and 7 of Form NRSRO, which elicit
information concerning the number of credit ratings an applicant or NRSRO has outstanding in
each class of credit ratings for which the applicant is applying to be registered or for which the
NRSRO is registered; 1987 (4) the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO,
which requires standardized “Transition/Default Matrices” and prescribes the method of
calculating transition and default rates; 1988 and (5) the amendments to Form NRSRO not
discussed above, including technical amendments.

guidance to broker-dealers with respect to the transition period for a similar reporting requirement).
1986

As discussed above, NRSROs should continue to submit Forms NRSRO and applicable exhibits to the
Commission in paper form until the Commission provides notice that the EDGAR system is ready to
receive the forms and specifies a date on and after which the forms and reports must be submitted through
the EDGAR system.

1987

The Commission notes that although the amendments to the instructions for Item 7.A of Form NRSRO will
not be effective on December 31, 2014, an NRSRO may elect to use the instructions for Item 7.A that are in
effect on that date for purposes of submitting an annual certification covering calendar year 2014.

1988

The Commission notes that although the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO will
not be effective on December 31, 2014, an NRSRO may elect to use the instructions for Exhibit 1 that are
in effect on that date for purposes of submitting an annual certification covering calendar year 2014.

512

The Commission is delaying the effective date for new paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(13),
(b)(14), and (b)(15) of Rule 17g-2, new paragraphs (a)(3)(iii)(E) and (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5, the
amendments to paragraphs (c)(6) and (c)(7) of Rule 17g-5, the amendments to paragraphs (a)
and (b) of Rule 17g-7, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of new Rule 17g-8, new Rule 17g-9, new
Rule 17g-10, new Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, new Rule 15Ga-2, and the amendment to
Form ABS-15G until nine months after this release is published in the Federal Register. This
delayed effective date is intended to provide time for NRSROs, issuers, underwriters, and
providers of third-party due diligence services to prepare for the changes that will result from
these new requirements.
Paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 prohibits an NRSRO from issuing or maintaining a credit
rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in determining or monitoring the
credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or methodologies used for determining the
credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative models, also: (1) participates in sales or
marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a product or service of an affiliate of the
NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or marketing considerations. The amendments to
paragraphs (c)(6) and (c)(7) of Rule 17g-5 remove an “or” after paragraph (c)(6) and add an “or”
after paragraph (c)(7) because of the addition of paragraph (c)(8) to the rule.
The amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 require NRSROs, when taking certain
rating actions, to publish a form containing information about the credit rating resulting from or
subject to the rating action and any certification of a provider of third-party due diligence
services received by the NRSRO that relates to the credit rating.
One NRSRO urged the Commission to provide “sufficient lead time” of “at least one
year” for complying with the proposed amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 to enable

513

NRSROs to “employ a rigorous process for developing and testing the changes to software and
systems needed to implement the requirement,” stating that several processes and technological
systems would need to be updated and implemented. 1989 Another NRSRO stated that it would
take at least 270 days to achieve compliance with the requirements of the proposed rule. 1990 The
Commission agrees that NRSROs may need several months to establish new, or adapt existing,
policies, procedures, controls, systems, and practices to comply with the new requirements
related to the form and certifications to accompany credit ratings. Accordingly, the Commission
is delaying the effective date for the amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 until nine
months after this release is published in the Federal Register.
The amendments to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 recodify requirements formerly
prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 and substantially enhance the requirements,
requiring NRSROs to disclose rating history information in XBRL format for free on an easily
accessible portion of their websites, add more rating histories to the disclosure, provide more
information about each rating action, and not remove a rating history from the disclosure until
fifteen years after the NRSRO withdraws the rating.
One NRSRO stated that implementing the changes required in proposed paragraph (b) of
Rule 17g-7 would generally require “significant lead time,” 1991 and another NRSRO stated that it
would take at least 270 days to achieve compliance with the proposed rule. 1992 A third NRSRO
requested that the Commission provide more time to comply with the proposed new
requirements to NRSROs offering subscription-based services which include frequent

surveillance. 1993 The Commission agrees that NRSROs may need several months to establish
new, or adapt existing, policies, procedures, controls, systems, and practices to comply with the
new requirements relating to rating histories disclosures. Accordingly, the Commission is
delaying the effective date for the amendments to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 until nine months
after this release is published in the Federal Register. The Commission believes that this delayed
effective date provides a sufficient amount of time for all NRSROs, including those with a
subscription-based business model, to comply with the new requirements.
Paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies the NRSRO
uses to determine credit ratings, and new paragraph (b)(13) of Rule 17g-2 identifies the policies
and procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies used to determine credit
ratings that an NRSRO must document pursuant to paragraph (a) of new Rule 17g-8 as a record
that must be retained.
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document policies and procedures with respect to the symbols, numbers, or scores it uses to
denote credit ratings, and new paragraph (b)(14) of Rule 17g-2 identifies the policies and
procedures with respect to credit rating symbols, numbers, or scores that an NRSRO must
document under paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 as a record that must be retained.
One NRSRO stated that proposed paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 could require some
NRSROs to change their rating symbol systems for certain categories of obligors or obligations
and requested a compliance deadline of at least twenty-four months for any such change. 1994 The
Commission does not believe that all NRSROs will need to change their rating symbol systems
1993

See Morningstar Letter.

1994

See Moody’s Letter.

515

in order to comply with new requirements relating to universal rating symbols. If an NRSRO
must make such change, however, the Commission believes that the delayed effective date of
nine months after this release is published in the Federal Register provides sufficient time for
such NRSRO to comply with the new requirements in paragraph (b) of new Rule 17g-8 and new
paragraph (b)(14) of Rule 17g-2.
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 requires that the policies and procedures an NRSRO is
required to establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange
Act with respect to look-back reviews must address instances in which a look-back review
determines that a conflict of interest influenced a credit rating by including, at a minimum,
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO takes certain steps reasonably
designed to ensure the credit rating is no longer influenced by the conflict and that the existence
and an explanation of the conflict is disclosed. New paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 17g-2 identifies the
policies and procedures of an NRSRO with respect to look-back reviews as a record that must be
made and retained.
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to consider certain prescribed factors
when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal structure
governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for
determining credit ratings pursuant to section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act.
Rule 17g-9 requires NRSROs to establish, maintain, enforce, and document standards of
training, experience, and competence for their credit analysts that are reasonably designed to
achieve the objective that the NRSROs produce accurate credit ratings in the classes of credit
ratings for which they are registered. The rule identifies four factors the NRSRO must consider
when designing the standards and provides that the standards must include a requirement for

516

periodic testing and a requirement that at least one individual with an appropriate level of
experience in performing credit analysis, but not less than three years, must participate in the
determination of a credit rating. New paragraph (b)(15) of Rule 17g-2 requires that NRSROs
retain a record of the standards required to be documented under Rule 17g-9.
One NRSRO stated that the compliance date for proposed Rule 17g-9 should take into
account that it will take a significant amount of time to develop, test, and implement the
standards. 1995 The Commission agrees that it may take several months for NRSROs to establish
new, or adapt existing, policies, procedures, controls, systems, and practices to comply with the
requirements relating to the standards of training, experience, and competence for credit analysts.
Accordingly, the Commission is delaying the effective date for Rule 17g-9 and paragraph (b)(15)
of Rule 17g-2 until nine months after this release is published in the Federal Register.
Rule 17g-10 requires that the written certification a provider of third-party due diligence
services must provide to an NRSRO be made on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. New paragraph
(a)(3)(iii)(E) of Rule 17g-5 requires an NRSRO to obtain an additional representation from the
issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of an asset-backed security that the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter
will post on the Rule 17g-5 website, promptly after receipt, any executed Form ABS Due
Diligence-15E delivered by a person employed to provide third-party due diligence services with
respect to the security or money market instrument.
One commenter suggested that proposed Rule 17g-10 should have at least a nine-month
transition period because implementation “will require coordination among market
participants…as well as the development of industry standards.” 1996 Another commenter stated
that a “reasonable transition period” should be provided to allow adequate time “to assess the
1995

See S&P Letter.

1996

See ABA Letter.

517

applicability of the new requirements…and to implement appropriate processes and
procedures.” 1997 A third commenter stated a compliance date of at least 180 days following
publication in the Federal Register would be required “in order to get necessary systems and
procedures in place.” 1998 The Commission agrees that market participants may need several
months to establish new, or adapt existing, policies, procedures, controls, systems, and practices
to comply with the new requirements related to third-party due diligence for asset-backed
securities. Accordingly, the Commission is delaying the effective date for the requirements
relating to Rule 17g-10 and new Form ABS Due Diligence-15E until nine months after this
release is published in the Federal Register.
Finally, new Rule 15Ga-2 generally requires an issuer or underwriter of any Exchange
Act-ABS that is to be rated by an NRSRO to furnish a Form ABS-15G on the EDGAR system
containing the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the
issuer or underwriter at least five business days prior to the first sale in the offering. 1999
One commenter suggested that Rule 15Ga-2 should have at least a nine-month transition
period because implementation “will require coordination among market participants…as well as
the development of industry standards.” 2000 Another commenter stated that a “reasonable
1997

See Deloitte Letter.

1998

See ASF Letter (“We also note that a 180-day period will minimize the possibility that a TPDDS Provider
might issue a report prior to the publication date of the final rules, which would later be subject to the
requirement for a TPDDS Provider Certification because it was provided to and used by an NRSRO in
connection with a rating.”).

1999

The Commission today is providing no-action relief for municipal issuers and underwriters with regard to
the required disclosures under the provisions of section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act for any
municipal Exchange Act-ABS issued prior to the effective date of Rule 15Ga-2. Municipal issuers and
underwriters are excluded from the application of Rule 15Ga-2, but will have to comply with the statutory
requirement in section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act to make the findings and conclusions of any
third-party due diligence reports publicly available commencing with the effective date of Rule 15Ga2. The Commission believes it is appropriate to provide such no-action relief because it proposed to
include municipal issuers and underwriters within the scope of Rule 15Ga-2, but has determined not to do
so.

2000

See ABA Letter.

518

transition period” should be provided to allow adequate time “to assess the applicability of the
new requirements…and to implement appropriate processes and procedures.” 2001 A third
commenter stated there should be a single compliance date of not less than 180 days following
publication in the Federal Register. 2002 The Commission agrees that market participants may
need several months to establish new, or adapt existing, policies, procedures, controls, systems,
and practices to comply with the new requirements related to third-party due diligence for assetbacked securities. Accordingly, the Commission is delaying the effective date for Rule 15Ga-2
and the amendments to Form ABS-15G until nine months after this release is published in the
Federal Register.
IV.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Certain provisions of the rule amendments and new rules contain new “collection of

information” requirements within the meaning of the PRA. 2003 The Commission solicited
comment on the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection of information
requirements in the proposing release. 2004 The Commission submitted the proposed collection of
information requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in
accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11.
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to comply with, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The titles and
OMB control numbers for the collections of information are:

systems and procedures in place, especially in light of other regulatory changes in the securitization
markets coming into effect in the near term. In the event that the Commission does not use a single
compliance date, we note that the compliance date for Rule 15Ga-2 must be no earlier than the compliance
date for Rules 17g-7 and 17g-10.”).

associated with the collection of information requirements within the meaning of the PRA.
These comments are addressed below. In part in response to these comments, the Commission
has modified the amendments and new rules being adopted today from the proposals. The
impact on the Commission’s burden estimates of these modifications, as well as adjustments to
reflect updated information used to make the estimates, are also discussed below.
A.

SUMMARY OF THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
REQUIREMENTS

The Commission is adopting amendments to existing rules and new rules that apply to
NRSROs, providers of third-party due diligence services for Exchange Act-ABS, and issuers and
underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS. The following rule amendments and new rules contain
collections of information within the meaning of the PRA.
1.

Amendments to Rule 17g-1

The Commission is amending Rule 17g-1. First, the Commission is amending paragraph
(i) of Rule 17g-1. 2006 The amendments require an NRSRO to make Form NRSRO and Exhibits
1 through 9 to the form publicly and freely available on an easily accessible portion of its
corporate Internet website (eliminating an option to make the form and exhibits available
“through another comparable, readily accessible means”) and to make its most recent Exhibit 1
freely available in writing to any individual who requests a copy of the exhibit.
Second, the Commission is amending paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 to require
NRSROs to use the Commission’s EDGAR system to electronically submit Forms NRSRO and
required exhibits to the form to the Commission as PDF documents in the format required by the
EDGAR Filer Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. 2007

2.

Amendments to Instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO

The Commission is amending the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. 2008 The
amendments standardize the production and presentation of the 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year
transition and default statistics that an NRSRO must disclose in the exhibit. The performance
statistics must be presented in a format specified in the instructions, which include a sample
“Transition/Default Matrix.” The amendments also enhance the information to be disclosed by,
for example, requiring statistics to be produced and presented for subclasses of structured finance
products and for credit ratings where the obligation was paid off or the credit rating was
withdrawn for reasons other than a default or the obligation was paid off.
3.

Amendments to Rule 17g-2

The Commission is amending Rule 17g-2. First, the Commission is adding paragraph
(a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the policies and procedures with respect to look-back reviews an
NRSRO is required to establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the
Exchange Act and paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 as a record that must be made and retained. 2009
Second, the Commission is adding paragraph (b)(12) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the internal
control structure an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to section
15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act as a record that must be retained. 2010 Third, the Commission
is adding paragraph (b)(13) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the policies and procedures with respect to
the procedures and methodologies used to determine credit ratings an NRSRO is required to
establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 as a record

that must be retained. 2011 Fourth, the Commission is adding paragraph (b)(14) to Rule 17g-2 to
identify the policies and procedures with respect to credit rating symbols, numbers, or scores an
NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g8 as a record that must be retained. 2012 Fifth, the Commission is adding paragraph (b)(15) to
Rule 17g-2 to identify the standards of training, experience, and competence for credit analysts
an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to Rule 17g-9 as a record
that must be retained. 2013 In addition, the Commission is amending paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2
to provide that records identified in paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(14), and (b)(15) of
Rule 17g-2 must be retained until three years after the date the record is replaced with an updated
record, instead of three years after the record is made or received, which is the retention period
for other records identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-2. 2014 The Commission also
repealed paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g-2 (the 10% Rule) and has re-codified (with significant
amendments) the requirements in paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 (the 100% Rule) in paragraph
(b) of Rule 17g-7. 2015
4.

Amendments to Rule 17g-3

The Commission is amending Rule 17g-3. First, the Commission is amending
paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-3. 2016 The amendment to paragraph (a) adds paragraph (a)(7)
to require an NRSRO to include an unaudited report – a report on the NRSRO’s internal control

structure – with its annual submission of reports to the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3. 2017
The amendment to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3 requires that the NRSRO’s CEO or, if the firm
does not have a CEO, an individual performing similar functions, must provide a signed
statement attesting to information in the internal controls report that must be attached to the
report. 2018
Second, the Commission is adding paragraph (d) to Rule 17g-3 to require that the annual
reports required to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3 be submitted
electronically through the Commission’s EDGAR system as PDF documents. 2019
Third, the Commission is adding paragraph (a)(8) to Rule 17g-3 to identify the report of
the NRSRO’s designated compliance officer that an NRSRO is required to file with the
Commission pursuant to section 15E(j)(5)(B) of the Exchange Act as a report that must be filed
with the other annual reports. 2020 This requirement will not result in a collection of information
because the statute requires the NRSRO to file the report with the Commission and to file the
report with the other annual reports. 2021 Consequently, paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 17g-3 standing
alone does not impose a burden. Moreover, the Commission is not adding any additional
requirements with respect to the filing other than the requirement that this report and the other
annual reports be submitted through the EDGAR system and the burden for filing the reports
through the EDGAR system is being allocated to Rule 17g-1. 2022

Amendments to Rule 17g-5

The Commission is amending Rule 17g-5. First, the Commission is adding paragraph
(a)(3)(iii)(E) to Rule 17g-5 to require an NRSRO to obtain a representation from the issuer,
sponsor, or underwriter of an asset-backed security that the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter will
post on the Rule 17g-5 website, promptly after receipt, any executed Form ABS Due Diligence15E delivered by a person employed to provide third-party due diligence services with respect to
the security or money market instrument. 2023
Second, the Commission is adding paragraph (c)(8) to Rule 17g-5 to prohibit an NRSRO
from issuing or maintaining a credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in
determining or monitoring the credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or
methodologies used for determining the credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative
models, also: (1) participates in sales or marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a
product or service of an affiliate of the NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or marketing
considerations. 2024
Third, the Commission is adding paragraph (f) to Rule 17g-5, which provides that upon
written application by an NRSRO the Commission may exempt, either conditionally or
unconditionally, the NRSRO from paragraph (c)(8) if the Commission finds that due to the small
size of the NRSRO it is not appropriate to require the separation within the NRSRO of the
production of credit ratings from sales and marketing activities and such exemption is in the
public interest. 2025

Amendments to Rule 17g-7

The Commission is amending Rule 17g-7. First, the Commission is incorporating the
disclosure requirement in Rule 17g-7 regarding representations, warranties, and enforcement
mechanisms available to investors in asset-backed securities that existed before today’s
amendments into paragraph (a) of the rule and is adding significant disclosure provisions to
paragraph (a) of the rule that require an NRSRO, when taking certain rating actions, to publish a
form containing information about the credit rating resulting from or subject to the rating action
as well as any certification of a provider of third-party due diligence services received by the
NRSRO that relates to the credit rating. 2026 The amendments prescribe: (1) the types of rating
actions that trigger the requirement to publish the form and, if applicable, any due diligence
certifications; 2027 (2) the format of the form; 2028 (3) the content of the form (which must include
certain qualitative and quantitative information relating to the credit rating); 2029 and (4) an
attestation requirement for the form. 2030
Second, the Commission is re-codifying in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 the requirements
to disclose rating histories that were contained in paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 before today’s
amendments. 2031 The amendments to Rule 17g-7 also increase the amount of information that
must be disclosed by expanding the scope of the credit ratings that must be included in the

New Rule 17g-8

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-8, which requires an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document certain types of policies and procedures and to consider certain
prescribed factors when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective
internal structure pursuant to section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act.
Specifically, paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain,
enforce, and document policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and
methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and models, the NRSRO uses to
determine credit ratings. 2032 The required policies and procedures include policies and
procedures relating to: (1) board approval of the procedures and methodologies for determining
credit ratings; 2033 (2) the development and modification of the procedures and methodologies for
determining credit ratings; 2034 (3) applying material changes to the procedures and
methodologies for determining credit ratings; 2035 (4) publishing material changes to and notices
of significant errors in the procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings; 2036 and
(5) disclosing the version of a procedure or methodology for determining credit ratings used with
respect to a particular credit rating. 2037

527

Paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures with
respect to the symbols, numbers, or scores it uses to denote credit ratings. 2038 The required
policies and procedures include policies and procedures relating to: (1) assessing the probability
that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will default, fail to make timely
payments, or otherwise not make payments in accordance with the terms of the security or
money market instrument; 2039 (2) clearly defining each symbol, number, or score in the rating
scale used by the NRSRO and including the definitions in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO; 2040 and (3)
applying any symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO in a manner that is
consistent for all types of obligors, securities, and money market instruments for which the
symbol, number, or score is used. 2041
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 requires that the policies and procedures an NRSRO is
required to establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange
Act with respect to look-back reviews must address instances in which a look-back review
determines that a conflict of interest influenced a credit rating by including, at a minimum,
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO takes certain steps reasonably
designed to ensure the credit rating is no longer influenced by the conflict and that the existence
and an explanation of the conflict is disclosed. 2042
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to consider certain prescribed factors
when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal structure
governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for

New Rule 17g-9

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-9. Rule 17g-9 requires an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for the
individuals it employs to participate in the determination of credit ratings that are reasonably
designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produce accurate credit ratings in the classes
of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 2043 Paragraph (b) identifies four factors the
NRSRO must consider when designing the standards. 2044 Paragraph (c)(1) requires NRSROs to
include a requirement for periodic testing in their standards. 2045 Paragraph (c)(2) provides that
the standards must include a requirement that at least one individual with an “appropriate level of
experience in performing credit analysis, but not less than three years” must participate in the
determination of a credit rating. 2046
9.

New Rule 17g-10 and New Form ABS Due Diligence-15E

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2047
Paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-10 provides that the written certification providers of third-party due
diligence services must provide to NRSROs pursuant to section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange

Act must be made on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2048 Paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-10 provides
that the written certification must be signed by an individual who is duly authorized by the
person providing the third-party due diligence services to make such a certification. 2049
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-10 provides a “safe harbor” for a provider of third-party due diligence
services to meet its obligation under section 15E(s)(4)(B). 2050 Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-10
contains four definitions to be used for the purposes of section 15E(s)(4)(B) and Rule 17g-10;
namely, definitions of due diligence services, 2051 issuer, 2052 originator, 2053 and securitizer. 2054
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E contains five line items identifying information the
provider of third-party due diligence services must provide. 2055 It also contains a signature line
with a corresponding representation. 2056 Item 1 elicits the identity and address of the provider of
third-party due diligence services. 2057 Item 2 elicits the identity and address of the issuer,
underwriter, or NRSRO that paid the provider to provide the services. 2058 Item 3 requires the
provider of the due diligence services to identify each NRSRO whose published criteria for

New Rule 15Ga-2 and Amendments to Form ABS-15G

The Commission is adopting Rule 15Ga-2 and amendments to Form ABS-15G. 2062 Rule
15Ga-2 requires an issuer or underwriter of certain Exchange Act-ABS that are to be rated by an
NRSRO to furnish a Form ABS-15G on the Commission’s EDGAR system containing the
findings and conclusions of any third-party “due diligence report” obtained by the issuer or
underwriter at least five business days prior to the first sale in the offering. These requirements
do not apply to issuers or underwriters of certain offshore offerings of Exchange Act-ABS. 2063
The rule and form also do not apply to issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS
but section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer or underwriter of these securities
to make publicly available the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report
obtained by the issuer or underwriter. Based on staff experience, the Commission estimates that
many of these issuers and underwriters are likely to satisfy this obligation by furnishing Form
ABS-15G on EMMA. Rule 15Ga-2 defines third-party due diligence report as any report
containing findings and conclusions relating to due diligence services as defined in Rule 17g-10
performed by a third party. 2064 Under the rule, the disclosure must be furnished using Form
ABS-15G for both registered and unregistered offerings of Exchange Act-ABS. However, if the

Amendments to Regulation S-T

As stated above, the Commission is requiring that certain Forms NRSRO and all Rule
17g-3 annual reports be submitted to the Commission electronically using the Commission’s
EDGAR system as PDF documents. 2066 In order to implement this requirement, the Commission
is adopting amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to require that Forms NRSRO and
Exhibits 1 through 9 submitted pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 and the
annual reports submitted pursuant to Rule 17g-3 be submitted through the EDGAR system as
PDF documents. 2067
12.

Form ID

NRSROs will need to submit Forms NRSRO and the required exhibits to the forms under
paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 and their annual reports under Rule 17g-3 to the
Commission through the EDGAR system. NRSROs will need to file a Form ID with the
Commission in order to gain access to the Commission’s EDGAR system to make electronic
submissions to the Commission.2068
Issuers and underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS also will need to furnish Form ABS-15G
to the Commission through the EDGAR system pursuant to Rule 15Ga-2. The Commission

for example, they need such access for purposes of Rule 15Ga-1.
B.

USE OF INFORMATION
1.

Amendments to Rule 17g-1

The amendments to Rule 17g-1 that require an NRSRO to use the EDGAR system to file
Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 and to make the form and exhibits freely available on an
easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s corporate Internet website are designed to make the
information disclosed in the form and exhibits more readily accessible to investors and other
users of credit ratings. 2069 In addition, the filing of the Forms NRSRO and the exhibits on the
EDGAR system will allow Commission examiners to more easily retrieve the submissions of a
specific NRSRO to prepare for an examination. Furthermore, having the forms filed and stored
through the EDGAR system will assist the Commission from a records management perspective
by establishing a more automated storage process and creating efficiencies in terms of reducing
the volume of paper filings that must be manually processed and stored.
2.

Amendments to Instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO

The amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO that standardize the
production and presentation of the 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year transition and default statistics an
NRSRO must disclose in the exhibit and enhance the information disclosed about these statistics
will allow users of credit ratings to evaluate the accuracy of credit ratings and compare the
performance of credit ratings by different NRSROs. 2070 As the Commission stated when

2069

See section II.E.2. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the requirement to make Form
NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 freely available on an easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s
corporate Internet website) and section II.L. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the
requirement to use the EDGAR system to file Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9).

2070

See section II.E.1. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the amendments).

533

originally adopting Form NRSRO, the information provided in Exhibit 1 is an important
indicator of the performance of an NRSRO in terms of its ability to assess the creditworthiness of
issuers and obligors and, consequently, will be useful to users of credit ratings in evaluating an
NRSRO. 2071 The amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO are designed to
make the required disclosure of an NRSRO’s performance statistics more useful to those who
use or might use credit ratings, including investors and creditors.
In addition, the amendments should improve the Commission’s ability to carry out its
oversight of NRSROs, which, in turn, will benefit investors. Improving and standardizing
performance statistics provided in an applicant’s initial application for registration and in an
NRSRO’s Form NRSRO could aid the Commission in, among other things, reviewing an
applicant’s or NRSRO’s performance and consistency of performance, which, in turn, could aid
in assessing whether the applicant or NRSRO has adequate financial and managerial resources to
consistently produce credit ratings with integrity. 2072
3.

Amendments to Rule 17g-2

The requirement to make and retain a record of the policies and procedures identified in
paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 17g-2 will promote better understanding of the policies and procedures
among individuals within the NRSRO and, therefore, promote compliance with such policies and
2071

See Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 72 FR at 33574; see also Amendments to Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 74 FR at 6474 (“The amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO will
require NRSROs to provide more detailed performance statistics and, thereby, make it easier for users of
credit ratings to compare the performance of the NRSROs. In addition, these amendments will make it
easier for an NRSRO to demonstrate that it has a superior ratings methodology or competence and, thereby,
attract clients.”).

2072

See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(a)(2)(C) (setting forth grounds to deny an initial application); 15 U.S.C. 78o7(d)(1)(E) and (d)(2) (setting forth grounds to sanction an NRSRO, including revoking the NRSRO’s
registration); see also Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical
Rating Organizations, 72 FR at 33612 (“Form NRSRO requires that a credit rating agency provide
information required under Section 15E(a)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act and certain additional information.
The additional information will assist the Commission in making the assessment regarding financial and
managerial resources required under Section 15E(a)(2)(C)(2)(ii)(I) of the Exchange Act.”).

534

procedures. 2073 The requirement that the internal controls structure, policies and procedures, and
standards identified in paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(14), and (b)(15), respectively, be
retained will subject these records to the various retention and production requirements of
paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of Rule 17g-2. 2074 The Commission staff will use these records to
examine an NRSRO’s compliance with the provisions of the securities laws requiring the
NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and document these controls, policies, procedures, and
standards. 2075 The amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 requiring that these records must
be retained until three years after the date the record is replaced with an updated record, rather
than three years after the record is made or received, will help the Commission better perform its
oversight function. For example, if the three-year retention period in Rule 17g-2 began to run
when the record is made, an NRSRO could discard the record that is replaced with an updated
record if that update occurred more than three years after the replaced record was made. This
could prevent the Commission from reviewing whether the NRSRO adhered to its previous
internal control structure, policies and procedures, or standards.

proven integral to the Commission’s investor protection function because the preserved records are the
primary means of monitoring compliance with applicable securities laws. Rule 17g–2 is designed to ensure
that an NRSRO makes and retains records that will assist the Commission in monitoring, through its
examination authority, whether an NRSRO is complying with the provisions of Section 15E of the
Exchange Act and the rules thereunder.”) (footnotes omitted).

535

4.

Amendments to Rule 17g-3

The amendments to Rule 17g-3 requiring an NRSRO to submit to the Commission an
annual internal controls report will be used by the Commission to perform its NRSRO oversight
function. 2076 For example, section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act requires an NRSRO to
“establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure governing the
implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for determining
credit ratings.” 2077 Paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 requires that the report describe material
weaknesses identified in the internal control structure and how they were addressed and that it
state whether the internal control structure was effective as of the end of the NRSRO’s fiscal
year. Consequently, the Commission can use the information provided in the report as part of
reviewing whether the NRSRO is complying with the requirement in section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the
Exchange Act. An NRSRO also can use the report to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal
control structure.
The amendment to Rule 17g-3 requiring that NRSROs use the Commission’s EDGAR
system to file the annual reports as PDF documents will assist the Commission in performing its
oversight function. 2078 For example, Commission examiners will be able to more easily retrieve
the reports of an NRSRO to prepare for an examination. Moreover, having these reports
submitted and stored through the EDGAR system will assist the Commission from a records
management perspective by establishing a more automated storage process and reducing the
volume of paper submissions that must be manually processed and stored.

Amendments to Rule 17g-5

The collection required under the amendment adding paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E) to Rule
17g-5 will be used by the providers of third-party due diligence services to meet their statutory
obligation to deliver the certification to any NRSRO that produces a credit rating to which the
services relate. 2079 Furthermore, disclosing these certifications on the Rule 17g-5 websites will
make them available to NRSROs that may not otherwise be aware that third-party due diligence
services are being employed with respect to an Exchange Act-ABS because, for example, they
are not hired to rate the Exchange Act-ABS.
The amendment adding paragraph (c)(8) to Rule 17g-5 will require an NRSRO to update
its policies and procedures for addressing and managing conflicts of interest to account for this
new absolutely prohibited conflict of interest. 2080 The updated policies and procedures will be
used by the NRSRO to address this conflict and comply with Rule 17g-5. Furthermore, Exhibit
7 to Form NRSRO requires an applicant for registration as an NRSRO or an NRSRO to provide
a copy in the exhibit of the written policies and procedures an applicant or NRSRO must
establish, maintain, and enforce to address and manage conflicts of interest pursuant to section
15E(h) of the Exchange Act. 2081 This disclosure by an NRSRO can be reviewed by investors
and other users of credit ratings to evaluate the NRSRO’s policies and procedures (including
those addressing the new absolutely prohibited conflict) and to compare them with the policies
and procedures of other NRSROs.

2079

See sections II.G.5. and II.H.2. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this amendment,
which will require an NRSRO to obtain a representation from the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of an
asset-backed security that the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter will post on the Rule 17g-5 website, promptly
after receipt, any executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E delivered by a person employed to provide thirdparty due diligence services with respect to the security or money market instrument).

seek an exemption from the Commission because of its small size from the provision
establishing the new absolutely prohibited conflict will be used by NRSROs to seek conditional
or unconditional exemptions from the new requirement. 2082
6.

Amendments to Rule 17g-7

The amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 that require an NRSRO, when taking
certain rating actions, to publish a form containing information about the credit rating resulting
from or subject to the rating action as well as any certification of a provider of third-party due
diligence services received by the NRSRO that relates to the credit rating will be used by
investors and other users of credit ratings to better understand the credit rating issued by the
NRSRO. 2083 In addition, the disclosure of the certification will allow investors and other users
of credit ratings to determine the adequacy and level of due diligence services provided by the
third party executing the certification. 2084
The amendments to Rule 17g-7 (codified in paragraph (b) of the rule) that require an
NRSRO to disclose rating histories may be used by investors and other users of credit ratings to
evaluate the performance of the NRSRO’s credit ratings. 2085 As the Commission stated when
adopting the original rating history disclosure requirement, the “intent of the rule is to facilitate
comparisons of credit rating accuracy across all NRSROs – including direct comparisons of
different NRSROs’ treatment of the same obligor or instrument – in order to enhance NRSRO
accountability, transparency, and competition.” 2086 The amendments also are designed to

provide persons (such as market participants and academics and other market observers) with the
“raw data” necessary to generate statistical information about the performance of each NRSRO’s
credit ratings. 2087 The information disclosed pursuant to the amendments also may be used by
economists to study the performance of NRSRO credit ratings. The Commission also may use
the information as part of its oversight function.
7.

New Rule 17g-8

Paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures with
respect to the procedures and methodologies the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings. 2088
These policies and procedures will be used by the NRSRO to achieve the objectives identified in
section 15E(r) of the Exchange Act, 2089 namely, that the NRSRO:
•

determines credit ratings using procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and
quantitative data and models, that are approved by the board of the NRSRO, or a body
performing a function similar to that of a board; 2090

•

determines credit ratings using procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and
quantitative data and models, that are in accordance with the policies and procedures of
the NRSRO for the development and modification of credit rating procedures and
methodologies; 2091

•

when material changes are made to credit rating procedures and methodologies
(including changes to qualitative and quantitative data and models), applies the changes
(Dec. 4, 2009) (“Ratings history information for outstanding credit ratings is the most direct means of
comparing the performance of two or more NRSROs. It allows an investor or other user of credit ratings to
compare how all NRSROs that maintain a credit rating for a particular obligor or instrument initially rated
that obligor or instrument and, thereafter, how and when they adjusted their credit rating over time.”).

2087

procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO takes certain steps reasonably
designed to ensure the credit rating is no longer influenced by the conflict and that the existence
and an explanation of the conflict is disclosed. 2104 These policies and procedures will be used by
the NRSRO to achieve the objective specified in section 15E(h)(4)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act to

New Rule 17g-9

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-9, which requires an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for the
individuals it employs to determine credit ratings. 2106 These standards will be used by the
NRSRO to achieve the objectives specified in sections 936(1) and (2) of the Dodd-Frank Act that
any person employed by the NRSRO to perform credit ratings produces accurate ratings for the
categories of issuers whose securities the person rates and is tested for knowledge of the credit
rating process. 2107 The requirement that the standards be documented in writing will be used by
the NRSRO to promote an understanding of the standards within the NRSRO and will be used by
the Commission to examine the NRSRO’s compliance with Rule 17g-9.

New Rule 17g-10 and New Form ABS Due Diligence-15E

The disclosure of information about third-party due diligence services on Form ABS Due
Diligence-15E pursuant to Rule 17g-10 will be used by NRSROs, investors, and other market
participants to evaluate the adequacy and level of the reviews of the assets underlying an
Exchange Act-ABS performed by the third party. 2108

Amendments to Regulation S-T

The amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T, as part of implementing the requirement
that NRSROs use the EDGAR system to submit Forms NRSRO and their annual reports under
Rule 17g-3 to the Commission, will be used by the Commission as part of its oversight of
NRSROs. 2110 In addition, the submission of the Forms NRSRO using the EDGAR system will
be used by investors and other users of credit ratings to evaluate and compare NRSROs.
12.

Form ID

NRSROs will need to file a Form ID with the Commission in order to gain access to the
Commission’s EDGAR system to file Form NRSRO (including applicable exhibits) and their
annual reports with the Commission. 2111 The Commission will use the filings of this form to
process NRSRO requests for access to the EDGAR system.
C.

RESPONDENTS

In adopting the first rules under the Rating Agency Act of 2006, the Commission
estimated that approximately thirty credit rating agencies ultimately would be registered as
NRSROs. 2112 Currently, ten credit rating agencies are registered with the Commission as
NRSROs. 2113 This number has remained fairly constant for several years. 2114 Consequently,

One NRSRO – R&I – withdrew its registration as an NRSRO effective November 27, 2011. See Notice of
Effectiveness of Rating and Investment Information, Inc.'s ("R&I") Withdrawal from Registration as a
Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO"), available at

543

while the Commission believes several more credit rating agencies may become registered as
NRSROs over the next few years, the Commission stated in the proposing release that it believed
that the actual number of NRSROs should be used for purposes of the burden estimates under the
PRA. 2115 The Commission did not receive comments regarding this statement, and the number
of credit rating agencies registered with the Commission as NRSROs has not changed since the
proposal was published in 2011. Therefore, the Commission is estimating that there are ten
credit rating agencies registered with the Commission as NRSROs for purposes of the burden
estimates.
In the proposing release, the Commission stated that it believed that there were
approximately 270 unique “securitizers” that would be subject to the requirements of Rule 17g10, Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, Rule 15Ga-2, and the amendments to Form ABS-15G. 2116 In
using the term securitizer, the Commission meant the person who organizes and initiates the
Exchange Act-ABS, rather than the issuing entity. 2117 As discussed above, in this release, the
issuer of a structured finance product can mean, depending on the context, the issuing entity or
the person that organizes and initiates the offering of the structured finance product (for example,
the sponsor or depositor). Consequently, for consistency in this release, the Commission is
referring to the respondents as issuers (rather than securitizers) but in doing so means the person
that organizes and initiates the offering of the Exchange Act-ABS. This is consistent with the
Commission’s intention in referring to these respondents as securitizers in the proposing release.

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33499.

2117

Section 15G(a)(3) of the Exchange Act defines the term securitizer to mean: “(A) an issuer of an assetbacked security; or (B) a person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed securities transaction by
selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to the issuer.” See
15 U.S.C. 78o-9(a)(3).

544

Further, the Commission is adjusting its estimate of the number of unique securitizers (now
referred to as issuers) from approximately 270 to approximately 336. 2118 This estimate includes
issuers of municipal Exchange Act-ABS. 2119
The Commission also stated in the proposing release that it believed that there were
approximately ten firms that provide, or would begin providing, third-party due diligence
services to issuers and underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS and, therefore, be subject to the
requirements of Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2120 However, the Commission
now estimates that there are approximately fifteen providers of third-party due diligence
services. 2121

TOTAL INITIAL AND ANNUAL RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING
BURDENS

NRSROs vary, in terms of size and complexity, from small entities that employ fewer
than ten credit analysts to complex global organizations that employ over a thousand credit
analysts. 2122 Given the significant variance in size between the largest and the smallest
NRSROs, certain estimates described below are averages across all NRSROs that will be
affected by the amendments and new rules being adopted today.
The Commission stated in the proposing release that it believed that it was reasonable to
base some of its burden estimates on the approximate number of NRSRO credit ratings
outstanding or the number of credit analysts employed by NRSROs, based on the most recent

2118

See section I.B.2.b. of this release (discussing the economic baseline with respect to issuers and providers
of third-party due diligence services).

Based on the Asset-Backed Alert database, the Commission estimates there were nine unique issuers of
municipal Exchange Act-ABS in 2013.

annual certifications submitted to the Commission by the NRSROs. 2123 An NRSRO objected to
this method of estimating the burden attributable to the proposal, stating that “to properly
evaluate the actual burden of the rules, particularly as they relate to the seven NRSROs that must
compete with the largest three NRSROs, the burden analysis must take into account not only the
number of ratings or analysts in isolation, but also must include the amount of legal and
compliance resources necessary to implement systemic and simultaneous changes” and that “the
investments will not be diminished relative to financial resources because an NRSRO may have
fewer analysts or credit ratings issued.” 2124 Similarly, another NRSRO stated that “the burden on
smaller rating agencies may be even more severe than the Commission’s numbers suggest” and
that “[w]hile some aspects of the proposals (such as disclosures and updates) scale in a linear
fashion with the number of published ratings, other costs (such as the development of new
disclosure templates and implementing new systems) are fixed.”2125 The commenter stated that
these “fixed costs have a disproportionate impact on smaller firms.” 2126 As discussed below, the
Commission based some of its burden estimates for three of the proposed amendments or new
rules on the number of NRSRO credit ratings outstanding or the number of credit analysts
employed by NRSROs and has reviewed these estimates to determine whether they should be
modified in response to these comments.
First, the Commission based its estimate of the one-time and annual burden associated
with the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO on the number of
NRSRO credit ratings outstanding. In response to the above comments, the Commission is

adding to its one-time burden estimate to account for aspects of the burden that do not depend on
the number of NRSRO credit ratings outstanding. For example, some of the burden associated
with establishing systems for determining performance statistics according to the amended
instructions may not depend on the number of credit ratings in the start-date cohort. 2127
Second, the Commission based its estimate of the annual burden associated with
publishing the form and due diligence certifications with the taking of a rating action under
paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7, as proposed, in part, on its estimate of the number of rating actions
taken by NRSROs. The annual burden estimate also included a component representing the time
an NRSRO would spend to update its standard disclosures and to tailor disclosures to particular
rating actions. In addition, the Commission estimated a one-time burden to develop the
standardized disclosures and to create the systems, protocols, and procedures for generating the
forms to accompany rating actions. However, while the Commission agrees that its estimate in
the proposal may have been low, as discussed in detail below (and above in section II.G. of this
release), the Commission has modified the proposed requirements in a number of ways that will
mitigate to some degree the burden of compliance with the requirements. The Commission is
therefore not increasing its estimate of the annual and one-time burdens to update disclosures and
create systems and procedures to comply with the rule. 2128
Third, the Commission based its estimate of the one-time and annual burden attributable
to establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting standards of training, experience, and
competence for the individuals it employs to determine credit ratings pursuant to Rule 17g-9, as
proposed, on the number of credit analysts employed by NRSROs. In response to the above

instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO).

See section IV.D.6. of this release (discussing the PRA burden resulting from the amendments to Rule 17g7).

547

comments, the Commission is adding to its burden estimate for this rule to account for a fixed
burden that does not depend on the number of credit analysts employed by an NRSRO, in
recognition of the fact that the burden associated with establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and
documenting standards of training, experience, and competence for credit analysts may not be
directly proportional to the number of credit analysts employed by an NRSRO. 2129
The Commission is updating its estimates of the number of NRSRO credit ratings
outstanding and the number of NRSRO credit analysts based on more recent information
submitted to the Commission by the NRSROs on Form NRSRO. The Commission now
estimates that NRSROs have a total of 2,437,046 credit ratings outstanding in all classes of credit
ratings. 2130 The Commission further estimates that NRSROs employ a total of 4,218 credit
analysts. 2131
Finally, in the proposing release, the Commission based some of its estimates for
purposes of the PRA on the number of Exchange Act-ABS offerings per year. 2132 For purposes
of these estimates, the Commission estimated that there would be approximately 2,067 Exchange
Act-ABS offerings per year. 2133 The Commission estimates that in calendar year 2013 there
were approximately 715 offering of Exchange Act-ABS. 2134 The Commission believes that the
more recent data on the number of offerings of Exchange Act-ABS should be used for purposes

See section IV.D.8. of this release (discussing the PRA burden resulting from Rule 17g-9).

2130

See Table 2 in section I.B.2.a. of this release. In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that
NRSROs had a total of 2,905,824 credit ratings outstanding in all classes of credit ratings. See Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33500.

2131

See Table 1 in section I.B.2.a. of this release. In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that
NRSROs employed a total of 3,520 credit analysts. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating

(which is based on data for calendar year 2013) and the 2,067 offerings per year estimate (which

2,067 offerings per year to 715 offerings per year.

Amendments to Rule 17g-1

The Commission is amending paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 to require that an NRSRO
make Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form NRSRO freely available on an easily
accessible portion of its corporate Internet website. 2136 The amendment removes the option for
an NRSRO to make the form publicly available “through another comparable, readily accessible
means” as an alternative to Internet website disclosure.
As stated above, the Commission believes that a Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9
will be “easily accessible” if they can be accessed through a clearly and prominently labeled
hyperlink (including through a hyperlink labeled “Regulatory Disclosures”) on the homepage of
the NRSRO’s corporate Internet website. NRSROs may need to make changes to their corporate
Internet websites to place clearly and prominently labeled hyperlinks to Form NRSRO and
Exhibits 1 through 9 on the websites. 2137 In the proposing release, the Commission estimated
that reconfiguring a corporate Internet website for this purpose would take an average of
approximately five hours (and would be accomplished by NRSROs using their corporate Internet
website administrators), resulting in an estimated industry-wide one-time burden of

approximately fifty hours. 2138 The Commission did not receive comment on this estimate and is
adopting the amendment as proposed. Therefore, the Commission is retaining this estimate
without revision.
The Commission also is amending paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1 to require that NRSROs
make their most recent Exhibit 1 freely available in writing to any individual who requests a
copy of the Exhibit to implement the rulemaking mandated in section 15E(q)(2)(D) of the
Exchange Act. 2139
In the proposing release, the Commission stated that it believed that NRSROs would need
to establish procedures and protocols for receiving and processing these requests and that this
would take an average of approximately forty-eight hours per NRSRO, resulting in an industrywide one-time hour burden of approximately 480 hours. 2140 The Commission did not receive
comment on this estimate and is adopting the amendments as proposed. Therefore, the
Commission is retaining this estimate without revision.
The Commission also estimated that each NRSRO would on average receive
approximately 200 requests per year and would spend an average of twenty minutes processing
each request, resulting in an industry-wide annual hour burden of approximately 670 hours. 2141
The Commission did not receive comments on this estimate and is adopting the amendments as
proposed. Therefore, the Commission is retaining this estimate without revision.

550

In response to comments stating that NRSROs should be able to charge the requesting
individual postage and handling fees, 2142 the Commission agrees, as stated above, that an
NRSRO may charge a reasonable postage and handling fee. 2143 Because NRSROs may choose
not to pass the postage costs on to persons requesting the exhibit in writing, the Commission
estimates that the cost of postage will be approximately two dollars per request, for an industrywide annual cost of approximately $4,000. 2144
The Commission is also amending paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 to require
NRSROs to use the Commission’s EDGAR system to electronically submit Form NRSRO and
the required exhibits to the form to the Commission as PDF documents in the format required by
the EDGAR Filer Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. 2145 NRSROs currently
submit these documents to the Commission in paper form.
The Commission estimated in the proposing release that each NRSRO would spend an
average of approximately four and 3/4 hours becoming familiar with the EDGAR filing system,
resulting in an estimated industry-wide one-time hour burden of forty-seven and a half hours. 2146
An NRSRO stated that it would have no objection to the proposal, that providing the
information as PDF documents would be “the most preferred and simplest” way to provide the
information, and that providing the information in and XBRL or XML format would not provide
additional analytical benefit and could make it more difficult for users to access Form

NRSRO. 2147 Another NRSRO, however, stated that the Commission’s estimate of the cost of the
proposal “accounts for only a small fraction of the expected cost of compliance” as “an NRSRO
will have to familiarize itself with the roughly 35 Rules of Regulation S-T as well as the first two
volumes of the EDGAR Filer Manual (which currently total more than 600 pages) and related
EDGAR technical guidance.” 2148 This commenter also stated that the Commission did not
estimate “the expense an NRSRO would incur in compiling Form NRSRO, its exhibits, and the
annual reports into an EDGAR-acceptable format.” 2149 However, the commenter did not provide
a different estimate of the costs associated with the proposal.
In response to the comment from an NRSRO that the Commission’s proposed cost
estimate for the proposal “accounts for only a small fraction of the expected cost of compliance”
and that instead PDF copies of the required submissions should be transmitted via e-mail, 2150 the
Commission notes that it has modified the proposed amendments to require that the electronic
submissions be made on EDGAR as PDF documents, which, as noted above, another NRSRO
described as “the most preferred and simplest” way to provide the information. 2151 The
Commission also points out that not all of Regulation S-T or the EDGAR Filer Manual applies to
NRSRO submissions, in particular, as these submissions will be made as PDF documents. 2152
Moreover, having the reports submitted via the EDGAR system – rather than to a Commission e-

mail box – will assist the Commission staff in storing and accessing these records in furtherance
of the Commission’s NRSRO oversight function.
In response to the comment that the Commission underestimated the burden of becoming
familiar with the EDGAR system, 2153 the Commission is revising its estimate, based on staff
experience, from 4 and 3/4 hours on a one-time basis as the amount of time, on average, an
NRSRO would need to spend to become familiar with the EDGAR system to sixteen hours, for
an industry-wide one-time burden of approximately 160 hours. 2154 This includes developing an
understanding of how to use the system for both submitting Forms NRSRO (and applicable
exhibits) and for submitting the Rule 17g-3 annual reports. The Commission is allocating this
one-time hour burden and corresponding cost solely to Rule 17g-1.
The Commission stated in the proposing release that it did not believe that changing the
method of submitting Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 from a paper submission to an
electronic submission would increase the current annual hour burden for Rule 17g-1. 2155 An
NRSRO stated that the Commission failed to consider the significant ongoing expenses of
monitoring changes in EDGAR filing requirements. 2156 Because the amendments to Rule 17g-1
require the submission to be made in PDF (the simplest process), the Commission does not
believe that changes to the EDGAR filer manual generally will impact the NRSROs. However,
the Commission agrees with the commenter that NRSROs will need to spend some time each
year reviewing changes to the EDGAR filer manual to determine whether they relate to the

16 hours x 10 NRSROs = 160 hours. In addition, as discussed below in section IV.D.12. of this PRA
analysis, the Commission estimates that the one-time industry-wide burden resulting from filing Form ID to
gain access to the EDGAR system to be approximately two and half hours, for a total industry-wide onetime burden of approximately 162.5 hours.

NRSRO’s submissions.2157 Consequently, the Commission now estimates, based on
Commission staff experience, that each NRSRO will spend an average of approximately two
hours per year monitoring changes in EDGAR filing requirements, resulting in a total industrywide annual hour burden of approximately twenty hours. 2158 This includes monitoring changes
in EDGAR filing requirements for both submitting Forms NRSRO and for submitting the Rule
17g-3 annual reports.
The Commission is allocating the one-time and annual hour burdens and corresponding
costs of the requirement to submit Form NRSRO and the Rule 17g-3 annual reports to the
Commission electronically on EDGAR as PDF documents solely to Rule 17g-1.
The Commission therefore estimates that the total industry-wide one-time hour burden
resulting from the amendments to Rule 17g-1 is approximately 690 hours 2159 to reconfigure
NRSROs’ corporate Internet websites, to establish procedures and protocols for receiving and
processing requests for a paper copy of Exhibit 1, and for becoming familiar with the EDGAR
system, and the total industry-wide annual burden is approximately 690 hours to process requests
for a paper copy of Exhibit 1 and to monitor changes in EDGAR filing requirements. 2160 The
Commission further estimates that the total industry-wide annual external cost to NRSROs
resulting from the amendments to Rule 17g-1 is approximately $4,000.

2157

See, e.g., Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Securities Act Release No. 9600 (June 16, 2014), 79
FR 35280 (June 20, 2014); Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Securities Act Release No. 9554
(Mar. 4, 2014), 79 FR 13216 (Mar. 10, 2014). The Commission succinctly summarizes the updates to the
EDGAR filer manual in these releases, which are less than ten pages long.

2158

10 NRSROs x 2 hours = 20 hours.

2159

50 hours + 480 hours + 160 hours = 690.

2160

670 hours + 20 hours = 690 hours.

Amendments to Form NRSRO Instructions

The Commission is amending the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. 2161 The
amendments standardize the production and presentation of the 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year
transition and default statistics that an NRSRO must disclose in the exhibit. The performance
statistics must be presented in a format specified in the instructions, which include a sample
“Transition/Default Matrix.” The amendments also will enhance the information to be disclosed
by, for example, requiring statistics to be produced and presented for subclasses of structured
finance products and for credit ratings where the obligation was paid off or the credit rating was
withdrawn for reasons other than a default or the obligation was paid off.
In the proposing release, the Commission stated that it believed that the burdens
attributable to the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 should be based on the number of
NRSRO credit ratings outstanding (which, based on annual certifications submitted by the
NRSROs for the 2009 calendar year end, totaled 2,905,824 credit ratings outstanding across the
ten NRSROs), that the one-time hour burden would be approximately three seconds per
outstanding credit rating, and that the annual hour burden would be approximately one and a half
seconds per outstanding credit rating, for an industry-wide one-time burden of approximately
2,420 hours and an industry-wide annual burden of approximately 1,210 hours. 2162
An NRSRO stated that collecting the data required for purposes of the proposed
amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO would be burdensome, and this
NRSRO suggested that NRSROs be exempt from the requirement to include historical data to the
extent that the NRSRO does not already capture such information “in a readily retrievable

2161

See section II.E.1. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the amendments).

2162

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33502.

555

format.” 2163 Another NRSRO stated that the definition of paid off as applied to obligors “is not
practicable” because some obligors do not have rated debt outstanding and it would be difficult
to track whether all obligations of an obligor are paid off. 2164 In addition, an NRSRO objected to
basing burden estimates on the number of credit ratings outstanding or the number of credit
analysts employed by NRSROs, stating that the burden estimates “must include the amount of
legal and compliance resources necessary to implement systemic and simultaneous changes.” 2165
As discussed in section II.E.1. of this release, in response to comment, the Commission
has modified the proposed instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. The final amendments
provide that, except for the issuers of asset-backed securities class of credit ratings, to determine
the number of credit ratings outstanding as of the beginning of the applicable period, the NRSRO
must include only credit ratings assigned to an obligor as an entity or, if there is no such credit
rating, the credit rating of the obligor’s senior unsecured debt, instead of all of the credit ratings
of individual securities or money-market instruments issued by the obligor. Because the
Commission has narrowed the scope of the types of credit ratings that will have to be included in
the performance statistics for four of the five classes of credit ratings, this should substantially
reduce the amount of historical information that will need to be analyzed. The Commission has
also revised the standard definition of paid off, in response to comment, 2166 to eliminate the
prong that applied to credit ratings of obligors as entities. The Commission has clarified that the
rule does not require NRSROs to track the outcomes of obligors, securities, or money market
instruments after the credit ratings assigned to them have been withdrawn, in response to

2163

556

comments from two NRSROs, 2167 one of which stated that “the proposed requirement to
separately track rating withdrawals, because of repayments and other reasons, likely would be
impractical in many cases.” 2168
The Commission believes that it is appropriate to base some of the burden estimates
attributable to the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 on the number of NRSRO credit
ratings outstanding, as the time required to retrieve information will depend on the number of
credit ratings outstanding and the time required to calculate the performance statistics should be
greater for a larger start-date cohort. However, as stated above, in response to comment, the
Commission is adding to its one-time burden estimate to account for burden that does not depend
on the number of NRSRO credit ratings outstanding. 2169 For example, some of the burden
associated with establishing systems for determining performance statistics according to the
amended instructions may not depend on the number of credit ratings outstanding. While
commenters did not provide an estimate of the amount of one-time burden that would be
unrelated to the number of credit ratings outstanding, the Commission is adding to the one-time
hour burden estimated in the proposing release a one-time hour burden that is not linked to the
number of credit ratings outstanding. Specifically, the Commission estimates, based on
Commission staff experience, a one-time burden of approximately fifty hours per NRSRO, for an
industry-wide total of approximately 500 hours on a one-time basis, 2170 attributable to the
amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 that is in addition to the one-time burden based on
the number of credit ratings outstanding.

2170

50 hours x 10 NRSROs = 500 hours.

557

In order to be conservative, the Commission is not revising its time per credit rating
estimates as a result of the modifications to the proposed amendments to the instructions for
Exhibit 1 in the final rule, although the modifications may result in lower burdens compared to
those of the proposed amendments. However, the Commission is updating its estimate of the
number of NRSRO credit ratings outstanding. Based on the annual certifications submitted by
the NRSROs for the 2013 calendar year, there were approximately 2,437,046 credit ratings
outstanding across all ten NRSROs. 2171 The Commission therefore estimates that the industrywide one-time hour burden for NRSROs to establish systems to process the relevant information
necessary to complete Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO that is based on the number of outstanding
credit ratings is approximately 2,031 hours 2172 and that the industry-wide annual burden is
approximately 1,015 hours. 2173
The Commission therefore estimates that the total industry-wide one-time hour burden to
NRSROs resulting from the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO is
approximately 2,531 hours 2174 to establish systems for determining performance statistics
according to the amended instructions and that the annual burden is approximately 1,015 hours
to calculate and format the performance statistics according to the amended instructions.

Amendments to Rule 17g-2

The Commission is adding paragraph (a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the policies and
procedures with respect to look-back reviews an NRSRO is required to establish, maintain, and
enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act and paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8

2171

See Table 2 in section I.B.2.a. of this release.

2172

2,437,046 credit ratings x 3 seconds = 2,030.9 hours (rounded to 2,031 hours).

2173

2,437,046 credit ratings x 1.5 seconds = 1015.4 hours (rounded to 1015 hours).

2174

500 hours + 2,031 hours = 2,531 hours.

558

as a record that must be made and retained. 2175 In addition, the Commission is adding the
following paragraphs to Rule 17g-2 to identify records that must be retained: (1) paragraph
(b)(12) identifies the internal control structure an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and
document pursuant to section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act; 2176 (2) paragraph (b)(13)
identifies the policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies used to
determine credit ratings an NRSRO is required to establish, maintain, enforce, and document
pursuant to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8; 2177 (3) paragraph (b)(14) identifies the policies and
procedures with respect to credit rating symbols, numbers, or scores an NRSRO must establish,
maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8; 2178 and (4) paragraph
(b)(15) identifies the standards of training, experience, and competence for credit analysts an
NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to Rule 17g-9. 2179 In
addition, in a modification from the proposal, the Commission is amending paragraph (c) of Rule
17g-2 to provide that records identified in paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(14), and (b)(15)
of Rule 17g-2 must be retained until three years after the date record is replaced with an updated
record, instead of three years after the date the record is made or received (the retention period
for other records identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-2). 2180
With respect to paragraph (b)(12) of Rule 17g-2, one commenter stated that the
requirement to document internal controls is burdensome, particularly for smaller NRSROs, and
argued that an NRSRO should be allowed to establish its own documentation policies and

procedures. 2181 However, the Commission is not imposing documentation requirements. Rather,
section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act requires an NRSRO, among other things, to document
its internal control structure. 2182
The Commission is adding paragraph (a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 to require NRSROs to make
and retain a record documenting the policies and procedures with respect to look-back reviews
an NRSRO is required to establish, maintain, and enforce under section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the
Exchange Act and paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 17g-8. The Commission is providing
estimates below in section IV.D.7. of this PRA analysis to address the burdens associated with
Rule 17g-8, including the one-time and annual hour burdens that will result from establishing,
maintaining, enforcing, and documenting the policies and procedures with respect to look-back
reviews required by section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act and paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8.
Consequently, for purposes of Rule 17g-2, the Commission is providing estimates of the
one-time and annual hour burdens resulting from the requirement to retain the records that are
identified in paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(14), and (b)(15) of Rule 17g-2. The
Commission believes that the one-time hour burden will result from the NRSRO needing to
update its record retention policies and procedures to incorporate these new records that will
need to be retained. NRSROs already have a recordkeeping system in place to comply with the
retention requirements of Rule 17g-2 before today’s amendments. The Commission estimated in
the proposing release that each NRSRO would spend an average of approximately twenty hours
updating its record retention policies and procedures, resulting in an industry-wide one-time hour

2181

See A.M. Best Letter.

2182

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-7(c)(3)(A).

560

burden of approximately 200 hours. 2183 The Commission did not receive comment on this
estimate.
The Commission estimated in the proposing release that it would take approximately one
hour per record each year to retain updated versions of these records, 2184 for an annual hour
burden for each NRSRO attributable to these proposals of approximately five hours, 2185 and an
industry-wide annual hour burden of approximately fifty hours. 2186 The Commission did not
receive comment on this estimate and, except for the amendment to paragraph (c) requiring that
the record be retained until three years after the date the record is replaced with an updated
record, is adopting the amendments to Rule 17g-2 as proposed. The Commission believes that
the amendment to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 will not affect the burdens estimated for Rule
17g-2 in the proposing release because the amendment removes an ambiguity in the proposal that
could be read to make the retention period shorter than the Commission intended and shorter
than the retention period upon which the Commission’s estimate in the proposing release was
based. Therefore, the Commission is retaining the one-hour per record estimate in the proposing
release without revision.
The Commission is repealing paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g-2 (the 10% Rule) and recodifying, with substantial amendments, the requirements in former paragraph (d)(3) of Rule
17g-2 in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 (the 100% Rule). 2187 The one-time and annual hour
burdens resulting from the enhancements to the 100% Rule are discussed below in section

2183

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33503 (10 NRSROs x 20 hours = 200
hours).

2185

5 records x 1 hour = 5 hours.

IV.D.6. of this release, which addresses the one-time and annual hour burdens resulting from the
amendments to Rule 17g-7.
Consequently, the Commission estimates that the total industry-wide one-time hour
burden for NRSROs resulting from the amendments to Rule 17g-2 to update their record
retention policies and procedures to incorporate these new records that will need to be retained is
approximately 200 hours and the annual hour burden to retain the records is approximately fifty
hours. 2188
4.

Amendments to Rule 17g-3

The Commission is amending paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-3. 2189 The amendment
to paragraph (a) adds paragraph (a)(7) to require an NRSRO to include an additional report – a
report on the NRSRO’s internal control structure – with its annual submission of reports to the
Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3. The amendment to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3 requires
that the NRSRO’s CEO or, if the firm does not have a CEO, an individual performing similar
functions, must provide a signed statement attesting to information in the report that must be
attached to the report.
In the proposing release, the Commission stated that because NRSROs already should
have developed processes and protocols to prepare the annual reports required by Rule 17g-3, the
2188

The adjusted industry-wide annual hour burden for Rule 17g-2 before today’s amendments was 4,000
hours. The elimination of the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g-2 will subtract seventy hours
from that amount. See Amendments to Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations,
74 FR at 6472. In addition, the re-codification of paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 in paragraph (b) of Rule
17g-7 will subtract an additional 450 hours from the adjusted industry-wide annual hour burden for Rule
17g-2 and that burden will be attributed to the industry-wide annual hour burden for Rule 17g-7. See
Amendments to Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 74 FR at 63853; section
IV.D.6. of this release. Consequently, after these subtractions, the adjusted industry-wide annual hour
burden for Rule 17g-2 will be 3,480 hours (4,000 hours - 70 hours - 450 hours = 3,480 hours). The
amendments to add paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(14), and (b)(15) to Rule 17g-2 being adopted
today will, as discussed above, add approximately fifty hours to the adjusted industry-wide annual hour
burden resulting in a total adjusted industry-wide annual hour burden of 3,530 hours (3,480 hours + 50
hours = 3,530 hours).

2189

See section II.A.3. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of these amendments).

562

internal hour burden associated with the first submission of the report on the NRSRO’s internal
control structure would not be materially different than the hour burden associated with
submitting subsequent reports, although the time required to prepare subsequent reports could
decrease incrementally over time as the NRSRO gains experience with the requirement. 2190 The
Commission stated that an NRSRO likely would engage outside counsel to analyze the
requirements for the report and to assist in drafting and reviewing the first report, that the time
outside counsel would spend on this work would depend on the size and complexity of the
NRSRO, and that an attorney would spend an average of approximately 100 hours assisting an
NRSRO and its CEO or other qualified individual in drafting and reviewing the first report,
resulting in an industry-wide external one-time hour burden of approximately 1,000 hours. 2191
Based on industry sources, the Commission estimated that the cost of outside counsel would be
approximately $400 per hour, 2192 and that the average one-time cost to an NRSRO would be
approximately $40,000, 2193 resulting in an industry-wide one-time cost of approximately
$400,000. 2194
In connection with the proposed amendments to Rule 17g-7, an NRSRO stated that the
Commission underestimated the hourly rate for retaining outside counsel. 2195 The commenter,

estimate of $400 per hour to engage outside counsel).

2193

10 NRSROs x $40,000 = $400,000.

563

however, did not provide alternative estimate of the hourly rate. Based on staff experience, the
Commission is retaining the hourly rate without revision. 2196
In terms of the annual burden relating to the submission of the reports, the Commission
estimated, based on staff experience, that each NRSRO would spend on average approximately
150 hours preparing the internal controls report, resulting in an industry-wide annual burden of
approximately 1,500 hours. 2197
In addition, the Commission stated that an NRSRO likely would continue to engage
outside counsel to assist in preparing the reports (after filing the first report) and that the time
outside counsel would spend assisting in the preparation of subsequent reports would be less than
the time spent on preparing the first report, since the counsel’s work will not need to include an
initial analysis of the new requirements. Consequently, the Commission estimated that an
attorney would spend an average of approximately fifty hours assisting an NRSRO and its CEO
or other qualified individual in drafting and reviewing the report, resulting in an industry-wide
annual hour burden of approximately 500 hours. 2198 As stated above, the Commission estimated
that the cost of outside counsel would be approximately $400 per hour. 2199 For these reasons, the
Commission estimated that the average annual cost to an NRSRO to comply with this
requirement would be approximately $20,000, 2200 resulting in an industry-wide annual cost of
2196

See Proposed Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 74 FR at 63889 (“Based on
industry sources, the Commission estimates that the cost of outside counsel would be approximately $400
per hour”).

2197

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33504 (10 NRSROs x 150 hours =
1,500 hours).

2198

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33504 (10 NRSROs x 50 hours = 500
hours). The Commission is adopting paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 as proposed. Accordingly, this
estimate remains unchanged from the Commission’s preliminary estimate in the proposing release.

2199

on industry sources, the Commission estimates that the cost of outside counsel would be approximately

564

approximately $200,000. 2201 The Commission did not receive comment on the hour estimates.
As proposed, paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 would require that the internal controls
report contain a description of the responsibility of management in establishing and maintaining
an effective control structure and an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control
structure. In response to comment, paragraph (a)(7), as adopted, has been modified from the
proposal to require that the report describe material weaknesses identified in the internal control
structure during the fiscal year and how they were addressed and to state whether the internal
control structure was effective as of the end of the fiscal year. 2202 In order to include an
assessment of the effectiveness of the NRSRO’s internal control structure in the annual internal
controls report, the NRSRO will need to identify any material weaknesses in the internal control
structure. In addition, since the statute requires that the internal control structure be “effective,”
the NRSRO will have to remediate any such weaknesses to comply with the statutory
requirement. 2203 Therefore, the Commission does not believe the modifications discussed above
necessitate adjusting the burdens from those that were proposed.
However, the modifications to the amendment from the proposal also require that the
internal controls report include a description of material weaknesses identified during the fiscal
year and how they were remediated. The Commission believes that documenting these items for
inclusion in the internal controls report will take NRSROs an average of approximately fifteen
hours per year, resulting in an internal burden of approximately 165 hours per NRSRO per year

for preparing the internal controls report, resulting in a total industry-wide annual burden of
approximately 1,650 hours. 2204
As discussed above in section IV.D.1. of this release, the amendments to Rule 17g-3 also
require that the annual reports be submitted electronically on the Commission’s EDGAR
system. 2205 The discussion of the Commission’s estimates of the burdens associated with the
requirement to submit the Rule 17g-3 annual reports electronically through the EDGAR system
in the proposing release, relevant comments on those burdens, the Commission’s responses to
those comments, and the Commission’s final burden estimates (which are revised in response to
comments) are discussed in section IV.D.1. of this release. Further, as discussed below in
section IV.D.12. of this release, the Commission estimates there will be burdens to complete
Form ID for purposes of submitting Form NRSRO (and Exhibits 1 through 9) and the Rule 17g-3
annual reports electronically through EDGAR. For purposes of this PRA analysis, the
Commission is allocating the burdens discussed above to Rule 17g-1 and Form ID.
The Commission therefore estimates that the amendments to Rule 17g-3 will result in a
total industry-wide one-time cost for NRSROs of approximately $400,000 to engage outside
counsel to analyze the requirements for the internal controls report, a total industry-wide annual
hour burden of approximately 1,650 hours to prepare the internal controls report, and a total
industry-wide annual cost of approximately $200,000 to engage outside counsel to assist in the
preparation of the annual internal controls report.

Amendments to Rule 17g-5

The Commission is adding paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E) to Rule 17g-5 to require an NRSRO to
obtain an additional representation from the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of an asset-backed
2204

150 hours + 15 hours = 165 hours; 165 hours x 10 NRSROs = 1,650 hours.

security that the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter will post on the Rule 17g-5 website, promptly
after receipt, any executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E delivered by a person employed to
provide third-party due diligence services with respect to the security. 2206 This provision, which
was not included in the proposal, may require NRSROs to redraft the agreement templates they
use with respect to obtaining representations from issuers, sponsors, or underwriters as required
under Rule 17g-5. Based on staff experience, the Commission estimates that an NRSRO will
spend approximately two hours on a one-time basis to redraft these templates, for a total
industry-wide one-time burden of approximately 6,720 hours. 2207 In addition, based on the
Commission’s estimate that there will be 715 offerings of Exchange Act-ABS per year, 2208 the
Commission estimates that issuers, sponsors, and underwriters will need to post approximately
715 Forms ABS Due Diligence-15E on Rule 17g-5 websites per year (in addition to the
information that is already posted to the websites). Based on staff experience, the Commission
estimates that it will take the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter approximately ten minutes to upload
each form and post it to the website, for a total industry-wide annual burden of approximately
119 hours. 2209
The Commission is adding paragraph (c)(8) to Rule 17g-5 to prohibit an NRSRO from
issuing or maintaining a credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in
determining or monitoring the credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or
2206

See sections II.G.5. and II.H.2. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this provision).

2207

336 issuers, sponsors, and underwriters x 2 hours = 672 hours; 672 hours x 10 NRSROs = 6,720 hours.

2208

See Table 6 in section I.B.2.b. of this release. Issuers, underwriters, and NRSROs may not use providers of
third-party due diligence services with respect to every issuance of Exchange Act-ABS. For example, the
Commission believes that providers of third-party due diligence services are used primarily for RMBS
transactions. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33471. However, the
Commission’s estimate uses the total number of estimated Exchange Act-ABS offerings (as opposed to a
lesser amount based on an estimate of RMBS offerings) because the use of providers of third-party due
diligence services may migrate to other types of Exchange Act-ABS.

methodologies used for determining the credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative
models, also: (1) participates in sales or marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a
product or service of an affiliate of the NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or marketing
considerations. 2210 As a consequence of the new absolute prohibition, the Commission believes
that an NRSRO will need to update the written policies and procedures to address and manage
conflicts of interest the NRSRO must establish, maintain, and enforce under section 15E(h) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 17g-5. The Commission estimates below that it will take an NRSRO
an average of approximately 100 hours to establish and make a record of its policies and
procedures with respect to look-back reviews. 2211 Based on Commission staff experience, the
Commission estimates that updating the conflicts of interest policies and procedures would take
an NRSRO an average of approximately 100 hours, for an industry-wide one-time burden of
approximately 1,000 hours. 2212
Exhibit 7 to Form NRSRO requires an NRSRO to provide a copy of the written policies
and procedures in the exhibit. Paragraph (e) of Rule 17g-1 requires an NRSRO to promptly file
with the Commission an update of its registration on Form NRSRO when information on the
form is materially inaccurate. The update of registration must be filed electronically on the
Commission’s EDGAR system. The Commission estimates, based on staff experience, that it
would take an NRSRO an average of approximately twenty-five hours on a one-time basis to
prepare and file the update of registration to account for the update of the NRSRO’s written
policies and procedures to address and manage conflicts of interest, for an industry-wide onetime burden of approximately 250 hours and a total industry-wide one-time burden of

approximately 1,250 hours to update the NRSRO’s conflicts of interest policies and procedures
and to prepare and file an update of registration to account for the update of the NRSRO’s
written policies and procedures. 2213
The Commission is adding paragraph (f) to Rule 17g-5, which provides that upon written
application by an NRSRO the Commission may exempt, either unconditionally or on specified
terms and conditions, the NRSRO from paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 if the Commission finds
that due to the small size of the NRSRO it is not appropriate to require the separation of the
production of credit ratings from sales and marketing activities and the exemption is in the public
interest. 2214 Based on staff experience, the Commission believes that an NRSRO applying for
the exemption would likely engage outside counsel to assist in drafting an exemption request,
that counsel would spend an average of approximately fifty hours for a cost of approximately
$20,000 to assist in drafting the request, and that the NRSRO would likely spend an average of
approximately 150 hours to draft and submit the application to the Commission. 2215

Amendments to Rule 17g-7

The Commission is incorporating the disclosure requirement with respect to
representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms in Rule 17g-7 before today’s
amendments into paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 and is adding to paragraph (a) significant
disclosure provisions that require an NRSRO, when taking certain rating actions, to publish a
form containing information about the credit rating resulting from or subject to the rating action

2213

10 NRSROs x 25 hours = 250 hours; 1,000 hours + 250 hours = 1,250 hours. See also Oversight of Credit
Rating Agencies Registered as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 72 FR at 33614

registration).

as well as any certification of a provider of third-party due diligence services received by the
NRSRO that relates to the credit rating. 2216
With respect to the one-time burden attributable to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7, the
Commission estimated in the proposing release that an NRSRO would spend an average of
approximately 5,000 hours to develop the standardized disclosures and create the systems,
protocols, and procedures for populating the form with information generated and collected
during the rating process, allocated 75% of these burden hours (3,750 hours) to internal burden
and 25% of these burden hours (1,250 hours) to external burden, and estimated a $400 per hour
cost for outside professionals such as counsel and information technology consultants, resulting
in an industry-wide one-time hour burden of approximately 50,000 hours and an industry-wide
one-time cost of approximately $5,000,000. 2217 As discussed below, the Commission is not
modifying its estimate with respect to the one-time burden attributable to paragraph (a) of Rule
17g-7. Further, as stated above, in response to a comment stating that the Commission’s
estimate of $400 per hour for retaining outside counsel is too low, 2218 the Commission notes that
the commenter did not provide an alternative estimate of the hourly rate. Based on staff
experience, the Commission is retaining the hourly rate without revision. 2219

2216

See section II.G. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of these amendments).

2217

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33505. This estimate was based on
the Commission’s estimate for the amount of time it would take a securitizer to set-up a system to make the
disclosures required by Form ABS-15G. See Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section
943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507. The Commission
significantly increased the estimate for Form ABS-15G because the form required pursuant to Rule 17g-7
contains substantially more qualitative information.

See Proposed Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 74 FR at 63889 (“Based on

Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507-4506 (providing an estimate of $400 an hour to
engage outside professionals).

570

With respect to the annual hour burden for paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7, the Commission
stated in the proposing release that it believed that the estimate should be divided into two
components: the amount of time an NRSRO would spend to update its standardized disclosures
and to tailor disclosures to particular rating actions and asset classes; and the amount of time the
NRSRO would spend generating and publishing each form and attaching the required
certifications to the form. 2220 With regard to the first component, the Commission estimated that
an NRSRO would spend an average of approximately 500 hours per year updating the
standardized disclosures, for an industry-wide annual hour burden of 5,000 hours. 2221 The
Commission stated that it believed that the burden attributable to the second component should
be based on the number of rating actions taken per year by the NRSROs because the requirement
to generate and publish the form and attach the certifications will be triggered upon the taking of
a rating action. 2222 The Commission further estimated that the ten NRSROs take approximately
2,909,958 credit rating actions per year, 2223 and estimated that the time it would take to generate
a form with the required disclosures and to publish the form with the credit rating would be an
average of approximately fifteen minutes, for an industry-wide annual hour burden of
approximately 727,490 hours, which would be allocated to the NRSROs based on the number of
credit ratings they have outstanding. 2224

Based on information submitted to the Commission by NRSROs, the Commission estimated that NRSROs
took approximately 2,000,000 rating actions in 2009, consisting of upgrades, downgrades, placements on
credit watch, and withdrawals of credit ratings. The Commission also estimated that NRSROs would issue
expected or preliminary ratings primarily with respect to new issuances of structured finance products,
which the Commission estimated at 2,067 per year, plus other issuances, for a total of 4,134 preliminary
ratings per year. The Commission also estimated that approximately 415,117 initial credit ratings are
issued per year and that 490,707 affirmations are issued per year. See Nationally Recognized Statistical
Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33505-33506

2224

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33505-33506.

571

The Commission received comments from NRSROs stating that the Commission
underestimated these costs and time burdens. 2225 However, these commenters did not provide
estimates of the costs and time burden. Another NRSRO generally objected to the use of the
number of credit ratings outstanding to estimate the burden of the proposed amendments and
new rules, because “the burden analysis must take into account not only the number of ratings or
analysts in isolation, but also must include the legal and compliance resources necessary to
implement systemic and simultaneous changes.” 2226
In part in response to comments, 2227 the Commission has modified paragraph (a) of Rule
17g-7 from the proposal in a number of ways to reduce burdens. 2228 For example, the
Commission narrowed the scope of rating actions that will trigger the disclosure requirement and
provided an exemption for certain rating actions involving foreign obligors or foreign-issued
securities or money market instruments. The Commission also significantly reduced the
reporting requirements relating to representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms. All
of these modifications were made in response to concerns about burdens raised by
commenters. 2229 Based on the comments above, the Commission believes it underestimated the
amount of the burden in the proposing release. However, the Commission also believes the
modifications discussed above will ease the burden to the extent that they will compensate for
the amount by which the Commission underestimated the burden. Consequently, the
Commission is retaining the original burden estimate.

572

The Commission continues to believe that the estimate of the time required to generate
and publish the form and attach the certifications should be based on the number of rating actions
taken per year by the NRSROs because the requirement will be triggered upon the taking of a
rating action. Based on staff experience, the Commission believes that expected or preliminary
credit ratings are published primarily (but not exclusively) with respect to new issuances of
structured finance products. The Commission estimates that there will be approximately 715
offerings of structured finance products per year. 2230 As stated in the proposing release, the
Commission, based on staff experience, believes that expected or preliminary credit ratings are
used in other types of offerings as well and, therefore, is increasing that estimate by 100%, to
1,430 preliminary or expected credit ratings per year. 2231
In terms of estimating the number of initial credit ratings, as stated above, the
Commission estimates that there are approximately 2,437,046 credit ratings outstanding across
all ten NRSROs. 2232 Based on staff experience, as stated in the proposing release, the
Commission estimates that the average maturity of rated securities and money market
instruments is approximately seven years. 2233 Consequently, assuming 2,437,046 is the
approximate average number of credit ratings outstanding at any given time, the Commission
estimates that approximately 348,149 initial credit ratings are issued per year. 2234

2230

See Table 6 in section I.B.2.b. of this release.

2231

715 x 2 = 1,430. See also Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33506.

2233

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33506.

2234

2,437,046 credit ratings/7 = 348,149 credit ratings. In other words, the Commission estimates that issuers
pay in full all outstanding principal and interest outstanding with respect to approximately 348,149 rated
securities or money market instruments and, consequently, the credit ratings for these securities and money
market instruments are withdrawn. Those withdrawn credit ratings, in turn, are replaced by 348,149 initial
(or new) credit ratings. Outstanding credit ratings assigned to securities and money market instruments are
withdrawn for other reasons, including that the security or money market instrument went into default. In
addition, a percent of the outstanding credit ratings are assigned to obligors as entities and, therefore, these
credit ratings would not be withdrawn because an obligation was extinguished. However, the credit ratings

573

Based on information submitted to the Commission by NRSROs pursuant to paragraph
(a)(6) of Rule 17g-3, 2235 the Commission estimates that in calendar year 2013 NRSROs made a
total of approximately 236,521 credit rating upgrades and downgrades, placed 176,374 credit
ratings on credit watch, and withdrew 191,062 credit ratings. However, the Commission notes
that the definition of rating action in the prefatory text of paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7, as
adopted, has been modified from the proposed definition to exclude placements of credit ratings
on credit watch and to only include an affirmation or withdrawal of an existing credit rating if
the affirmation or withdrawal is the result of a review of the credit rating assigned to the obligor,
security, or money market instrument by the NRSRO using applicable procedures and
methodologies for determining credit ratings. The Commission estimates that virtually all
withdrawals of credit ratings by NRSROs are in connection with routine debt maturities, calls, or
redemptions in which case the withdrawal would result from the extinguishment of the debtor’s
obligation and not from an analysis of the debtor’s creditworthiness. Consequently, virtually all
withdrawals would not result from the application of the NRSRO’s rating procedure or
methodology to analyze the creditworthiness of the debtor. Therefore, virtually all withdrawals
under the modified definition of rating action would not trigger the requirements of paragraph (a)
of Rule 17g-7. Consequently, the Commission is excluding the number of withdrawals per year
from the total number of rating actions per year that will trigger the requirements of paragraph
(a) of Rule 17g-7.

might be withdrawn for other reasons, including that the obligor went into default. Nonetheless, the
Commission continues to believe these estimates are reasonable approximations of the number of initial
credit ratings determined per year. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at
33506, n.1011.
2235

See paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 17g-3.

574

Finally, with respect to affirmations of existing credit ratings, the Commission believes
that NRSROs generally affirm existing credit ratings at least once a year. Consequently, the
Commission estimates that the number of affirmations would be the total number of credit
ratings outstanding (2,437,046), less the number of credit ratings that are upgraded and
downgraded (236,521), placed on credit watch (176,374), withdrawn (191,062), and paid off
during the year (348,149), for a total of 1,485,940 estimated NRSRO affirmations of existing
credit ratings.
Based on these estimates, the Commission estimates that the ten NRSROs take an
aggregate of approximately 2,071,040 credit rating actions per year, according to the definition
of rating action in paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7, as adopted. 2236 The Commission notes that the
exemption in the rule for rating actions involving certain foreign obligors, securities, or money
market instruments could reduce the number of rating actions that trigger the requirement to
publish the form and any applicable due diligence certifications. However, in light of the
comments arguing that the Commission underestimated the burden of the rule, taken in
conjunction with the modifications from the proposal that reduce the number of rating actions
covered, the Commission is not adjusting the number of rating actions for the purposes of these
estimates.
The Commission preliminarily estimated that it would take approximately fifteen minutes
on average to generate a form by populating it with the required disclosures and to publish the
form. Commenters made general statements that the rule would result in significant burden 2237
2236

236,521 upgrades and downgrades + 1,484,940 affirmations + 348,149 initial credit ratings + 1,430
preliminary or expected credit ratings = 2,071,040 rating actions per year. For purposes of paragraph (a) of
Rule 17g-7, credit ratings placed on credit watch and withdrawn credit ratings are not included in this
calculation due to the definition of rating action.

2237

See A.M. Best Letter (“We believe that expanding 17g-7 disclosure requirements to non-asset-backed
ratings is extremely overly-burdensome…”).

575

or that the Commission underestimated the burden. 2238 Commenters, however, did not provide
alternative estimates of the burden. Nonetheless, the Commission is revising its estimate, based
on staff experience and in light of the comments, to twenty minutes on average for each rating
action, resulting in an industry-wide annual hour burden of approximately 690,347 hours. 2239
The Commission is not revising its estimate of the amount of time an NRSRO would
spend to update its standardized disclosures and to tailor disclosures to particular rating actions
and asset classes. The Commission therefore estimates an annual burden per NRSRO of
approximately 500 hours and an industry-wide annual hour burden of approximately 5,000
hours. 2240 Based on staff experience, the Commission believes that the update process will be
handled by the NRSROs internally.
The Commission is also amending paragraph (b) to Rule 17g-7 to re-codify the
requirements to disclose rating histories that were contained in paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2
before today’s amendments (the 100% Rule) and increases the amount of information that must
be disclosed by expanding the scope of the credit ratings that must be included in the histories
and by adding additional data elements that must be disclosed in the rating history for a
particular credit rating. 2241
In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that the average one-time burden
attributable to the enhancements to the 100% Rule per NRSRO would be approximately 135

2238

See DBRS Letter (“DBRS believes that the Commission has grossly underestimated…the amount of time it
will take to compile a disclosure form for each rating action”); Morningstar Letter (“We disagree with the
Commission’s estimation that the form of these certificates will be largely standardized and take 15
minutes to complete per rating action. We believe that the Commission’s estimation is too low since
proposed provisions will not be able to be standardized across rating actions or asset class types and will
still require an individual analysis of the securities transaction.”) (footnote omitted).

hours to program existing systems and initially add the ratings histories for all outstanding credit
ratings as of June 26, 2007, for an industry-wide one-time burden of approximately 1,350 hours,
and that the average annual burden per NRSRO to comply with the increased requirements,
including updating and administering the database, would be approximately forty-five hours per
year, for an industry-wide annual burden of approximately 450 hours. 2242
One NRSRO stated that constantly updating the database for the 100% Rule “would
impose an unwarranted burden on NRSROs.” 2243 Another NRSRO stated that NRSROs may not
have, or may find it difficult to obtain, the additional information required by the
amendments. 2244 A third NRSRO stated that because it does not consider affirmations,
confirmations, placement of credit ratings on watch or review, and assignment of default status
to be credit rating actions and does not subdivide withdrawn credit ratings into the subcategories
of withdrawn due to default, withdrawn because paid in full, and “other,” it does not capture
some of that information in a format that is readily retrievable and therefore it recommends that
the rule exempt NRSROs from providing historical data to the extent it does not already capture
the data in a readily retrievable format. 2245 One NRSRO that generally supported the
amendments also stated that NRSROs may not be able to provide XBRL information as of June
26, 2007, since those rating actions are beyond the scope of the 3-year record retention
requirement. 2246 Three NRSROs objected to the requirement to disclose the legal name and CIK
number of the rated obligor or issuer of the security or money market instrument and the CUSIP

of the security or money market instrument. 2247 One NRSRO stated that it was “unnecessarily
burdensome” to require the use of identifiers that may become obsolete, that require NRSROs to
pay a fee, or that may not be used outside the United States, as long as NRSROs “use some kind
of identifier system sufficient to identify the rated obligor and obligation,” for example, “an
internationally recognized LEI [Legal Entity Identifier] system.” 2248
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that it has modified paragraph (b)
of Rule 17g-7 from the proposal to reduce the burden. 2249 To focus the disclosure of rating
histories on the rating actions that are most relevant to evaluating performance, the final
amendments eliminate the proposed requirement to include placements on watch and
affirmations (and the required data associated with these actions) in the rating histories. 2250 The
final amendments also significantly shorten the time horizon of historical information that must
be retrieved for inclusion in the rating histories. In particular, the proposed requirement to
include information for all credit ratings outstanding on or after June 26, 2007 has been replaced
with a standard three-year backward looking requirement that applies irrespective of when the
NRSRO is registered in a class of credit ratings. This, together with the elimination of two types
of rating actions that would trigger a requirement to add information to a credit rating’s history –
placements of the security on credit watch or review and affirmations of the credit rating –
should significantly mitigate the costs of retrieving and analyzing historical information for the

2247

See DBRS Letter; Moody’s Letter; S&P Letter.

2248

See Moody’s Letter. As discussed in section II.E.3. of this release, the Commission believes the
requirement to disclose the CUSIP of the security or money market instrument that is the subject of the
rating action is necessary to make the disclosures readily searchable.

See section II.E.3. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the modifications). See also
DBRS letter (stating that the 100% Rule “would impose an unwarranted burden on NRSROs”); Moody’s

analysis”).

2250

See Moody’s Letter (stating that it does not consider these activities to be rating actions).

578

purposes of making the rating histories disclosures. 2251 The modifications also should mitigate
to some extent concerns about having to obtain information that was not traditionally retained by
the NRSRO as it will significantly narrow the scope of such information that will need to be
included in the rating histories. Further, the modifications should reduce the burden of updating
the XBRL data file with new information. The final amendments also specify a standard for
updating the file – no less frequently than monthly – in response to a suggestion by a
commenter. 2252 This will make the costs resulting from the requirement lower than if the file
needed to be updated more frequently. In addition, the final rule prioritizes identifier disclosure
to an LEI and then to a CIK, if the LEI is not available. 2253 Finally, the final amendments
modify the proposal to reduce the time period a credit rating history must be retained after the
credit rating is withdrawn from twenty years to fifteen years. This should reduce the data
retention and maintenance costs associated with the final rule as compared to the proposed rule.
The modifications are expected to reduce the burden associated with the rule. However,
the Commission is not decreasing the burden estimates, notwithstanding the modifications to the
rule that reduce the burdens from the rule as proposed, in light of comments that the estimates in
the proposal were too low.
In summary, the Commission estimates that the burden associated with paragraph (a) of
Rule 17g-7 will result in a total industry-wide one-time hour burden to develop the standardized
disclosures and create the systems, protocols, and procedures for populating the form with
information generated and collected during the rating process of approximately 37,500 hours and
a total industry-wide one-time cost of approximately $5,000,000 to engage outside professionals

such as counsel and information technology consultants to assist in developing the standardized
disclosures and programming existing systems, and a total industry-wide annual hour burden to
update standardized disclosures, to tailor disclosures to particular rating actions and asset classes,
and to generate and publish each form and attach the required certifications to the form, of
approximately 695,347 hours. 2254 With respect to the amendments to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g7, the Commission estimates that the burden associated with the enhancements to the 100% Rule
will result in a total industry-wide one-time hour burden of approximately 1,350 hours to
program existing systems and initially add the ratings histories for all applicable outstanding
credit ratings and a total industry-wide annual hour burden to comply with the increased
requirements, including updating and administering the database, of approximately 450
hours. 2255

New Rule 17g-8

Paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies, including
qualitative and quantitative data and models, the NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings. 2256 In
the proposing release, the Commission estimated that an NRSRO would spend an average of
approximately 200 hours establishing the policies and procedures, resulting in an industry-wide
one-time hour burden of approximately 2,000 hours, 2257 and that an NRSRO would spend an
average of approximately fifty hours per year reviewing the policies and procedures, updating

2254

5,000 hours + 690,347 hours = 695,347 hours.

2255

As stated above in section IV.D.3. of this release, the re-codification of paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 (the
100% Rule before today’s amendments) in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 will subtract 450 hours from the
industry-wide annual hour burden for Rule 17g-2. This burden will be attributed to the industry-wide
annual hour burden for Rule 17g-7.

them (if necessary), and enforcing them, resulting in an industry-wide annual hour burden of
approximately 500 hours. 2258 The Commission did not receive comments on these estimates and
is adopting the amendments to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 substantially as proposed. The
Commission does not believe the modifications will change the burden estimates as they either
remove ambiguities or make minor wording revisions. Consequently, the Commission is
retaining the estimates without revision.
In addition, the Commission estimates that it will take an NRSRO an average of
approximately twenty hours to promptly publish on an easily accessible portion of its Internet
website information about material changes to its procedures and methodologies to determine
credit ratings and the likelihood such changes will result in changes to any current credit ratings,
or a notice of significant errors identified in a procedure or methodology.
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain, enforce, and
document policies and procedures with respect to the symbols, numbers, or scores it uses to
denote credit ratings. 2259 In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that an NRSRO
would spend an average of approximately 200 hours establishing the policies and procedures,
resulting in an industry-wide one-time hour burden of approximately 2,000 hours, 2260 and that an
NRSRO would spend an average of approximately fifty hours per year reviewing the policies
and procedures, updating them (if necessary), and enforcing them, resulting in an industry-wide
annual hour burden of approximately 500 hours. 2261 The Commission did not receive comment
on these estimates and is adopting the amendments to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 substantially

as proposed. The Commission does not believe the modifications will change the burden
estimates as they are minor wording revisions. Consequently, the Commission is retaining the
estimates without revision.
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 requires that the policies and procedures an NRSRO is
required to establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange
Act with respect to look-back reviews must address instances in which a look-back review
determines that a conflict of interest influenced a credit rating by including, at a minimum,
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO takes certain steps reasonably
designed to ensure the credit rating is no longer influenced by the conflict and that the existence
and an explanation of the conflict is disclosed in the form required under paragraph (a) of Rule
17g-7. 2262 In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that an NRSRO would spend an
average of approximately 100 hours establishing and making a record of the policies and
procedures, resulting in an industry-wide one-time hour burden of approximately 1,000
hours, 2263 and that an NRSRO would spend an average of approximately twenty-five hours per
year reviewing, and, if necessary, updating the policies and procedures and its record
documenting the policies and procedures, maintaining and enforcing the policies and procedures,
and taking steps pursuant to the policies and procedures when a look-back review determines
that a credit rating was influenced by a conflict, resulting in an average industry-wide annual
hour burden of approximately 250 hours. 2264 The Commission did not receive comment on these
estimates and is adopting the amendments to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 with modifications that
reduce the burden in terms of the steps an NRSRO must take pursuant to the policies and

procedures when a look-back review determines that a credit rating was influenced by a conflict.
However, the PRA burden accounts for the time an NRSRO will spend establishing, reviewing
and updating, and documenting the policies and procedures. The time spent establishing,
reviewing, updating, and documenting the policies and procedures will not change because of the
modifications to the rule from the proposal. Consequently, the Commission is retaining these
estimates without revision.
The Commission therefore estimates that the total industry-wide one-time hour burden to
the NRSROs resulting from Rule 17g-8, as adopted, is approximately 5,000 hours to: (1)
establish and document policies and procedures with respect to an NRSRO’s procedures and
methodologies to determine credit ratings; (2) establish and document policies and procedures
with respect to the symbols, numbers, or scores an NRSRO uses to denote credit ratings; and (3)
establish and make a record of its policies and procedures with respect to look-back reviews. 2265
The Commission estimates that the total industry-wide annual hour burden resulting from Rule
17g-8, as adopted, is approximately 1,250 hours to: (1) maintain, review, update (if necessary),
and enforce an NRSRO’s policies and procedures with respect to an NRSRO’s procedures and
methodologies to determine credit ratings; (2) maintain, review, update (if necessary), and
enforce its procedures and methodologies with respect to the symbols, numbers, or scores it uses
to denote credit ratings; and (3) maintain, review, update (if necessary), and enforce its policies
and procedures with respect to look-back reviews and its record documenting the policies and
procedures and take steps when a look-back review determines that a credit rating was
influenced by a conflict. 2266
2265

2,000 hours + 2,000 + 1,000 hours = 5,000 hours. The burden associated with retaining the record
documenting the procedures is attributed to Rule 17g-2.

2266

500 hours + 500 hours + 250 hours = 1,250 hours. The burden associated with retaining the record
documenting the procedures is attributed to Rule 17g-2.

New Rule 17g-9

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-9, which requires an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for the
individuals it employs to determine credit ratings. 2267
The Commission stated in the proposing release that in order to account for the
significant variance in the size and complexity of NRSROs, the one-time and annual hour burden
estimates attributable to Rule 17g-9 should be based on the number of credit analysts employed
by the NRSROs. 2268 Based on 2009 annual certifications, the Commission estimated that
NRSROs employed approximately 3,520 credit analysts and that the one-time burden to establish
the standards required under proposed Rule 17g-9 would be approximately five hours per credit
analyst, resulting in an industry-wide one-time hour burden of 17,600 hours. 2269 In addition, the
Commission allocated 75% of these burden hours (13,200 hours) to internal burden and 25% of
these burden hours (4,400 hours) to external burden to hire outside professionals to assist in
setting up training programs. 2270 The Commission stated in the proposing release that it believed
that the annual hour burden to comply with Rule 17g-9 would be less than the one-time hour
burden since NRSROs will have established the standards of training, experience, and
competence for the individuals they employ to determine credit ratings. The Commission
estimated that the industry-wide annual hour burden to update the standards and to enforce them
would be approximately one hour per credit analyst employed, resulting in an industry-wide
annual hour burden of approximately 3,520 hours and allocated 75% of the burden hours (2,640

hours) to internal burden and the remaining 25% of the burden hours (880 hours) to external
burden. 2271 The Commission did not receive comment on these allocation percentages and is
retaining them as proposed.
However, as stated above, an NRSRO objected to using the number of credit ratings or
credit analysts in estimating the burdens associated with the proposal, stating that the burden
must also “include the amount of legal and compliance resources necessary to implement system
and simultaneous changes” and that “the investments will not be diminished relative to financial
resources because an NRSRO may have fewer analysts or credit ratings issued.” 2272 In response
to this comment, the Commission is adding to its burden estimate for Rule 17g-9 to account for
burdens that do not depend on the number of credit analysts employed by an NRSRO. For
example, the cost of establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting standards of training,
experience, and competence for credit analysts, establishing testing programs, and administering
training and testing programs may not be directly proportional to the number of credit analysts
employed by an NRSRO. The Commission believes that it is appropriate, however, to retain the
burdens based on the number of credit analysts employed by NRSROs as some of the burden
attributable to Rule 17g-9 (for example, the burden associated with testing credit analysts on
their knowledge of the procedures and methodologies used by the NRSRO to determine credit
ratings) may be proportional to the number of credit analysts employed by an NRSRO.
Based on staff experience, the Commission estimates that the additional burden
attributable to Rule 17g-9 that does not depend on the number of credit analysts employed by an
NRSRO is approximately 400 hours per NRSRO on a one-time basis and approximately 100
hours per NRSRO annually, for an industry-wide one-time hour burden of approximately 4,000
2271

585

hours and an industry-wide annual hour burden of approximately 1,000 hours. The Commission
continues to believe that it is appropriate to allocate 75% of the one-time and annual burden
hours to internal burden and the remaining 25% to external burden to hire outside professionals
to assist in establishing and updating credit analyst training programs. Of the totals, therefore,
3,000 hours are allocated to internal one-time burden, 2273 1,000 hours are allocated to external
one-time burden, 2274 750 hours are allocated to internal annual burden, 2275 and 250 hours are
allocated to external annual burden. 2276 The Commission estimated that it would cost $400 per
hour to retain outside professionals, resulting in industry-wide one-time costs of approximately
$400,000 2277 and industry-wide annual costs of approximately $100,000. 2278
As stated above, the burdens the Commission estimated above that do not depend on the
number of credit analysts are additional to the burdens that depend on the number of credit
analysts. In addition, the Commission believes that the modifications to Rule 17g-9 from the
proposal will not affect the burden per credit analyst or the allocation of that burden to internal
and external burdens that the Commission estimated in the proposing release, as those
modifications should not affect the burdens associated with establishing, maintaining, enforcing,
and documenting the standards. However, the Commission is revising the total number of credit
analysts employed by the NRSROs based on updated information. The Commission now

2273

4,000 hours x .75 = 3,000 hours.

2274

4,000 hours x .25 = 1,000 hours.

2275

1,000 hours x .75 = 750 hours.

2276

1,000 hours x .25 = 250 hours.

2277

1,000 hours x $400 = $400,000. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR 33508.
See also Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507-4506 (providing an estimate of $400 an hour engage
outside professionals).

2278

250 hours x $400 = $100,000.

586

estimates that NRSROs employ a total of approximately 4,218 credit analysts. 2279 Therefore, the
Commission estimates the industry-wide one-time hour burden based on the number of credit
analysts employed by the NRSROs to be approximately 21,090 hours. 2280 Of this total, 15,818
hours are allocated to internal burden and 5,272 hours are allocated to external burden. 2281 The
Commission estimates that it would cost $400 per hour for retaining outside professionals,
resulting in an industry-wide one-time cost of approximately $2,108,800. 2282
Similarly, the Commission now estimates an industry-wide annual hour burden based on
the number of credit analysts employed by the NRSROs of approximately 4,218 hours. 2283 The
Commission is allocating 75% of these burden hours (3,164 hours) to internal burden and 25%
these burden hours (1,054 hours) to external burden to hire outside professionals to assist in
reviewing and updating training and testing programs. 2284 The Commission continues to
estimate a cost of $400 per hour for retaining outside professionals, which results in an industrywide annual cost of $421,600. 2285 Finally, although larger NRSROs may realize economies of
scale, the Commission believes that the industry-wide annual and one-time hour burdens and
external costs would be allocated to each NRSRO based on the number of credit analysts the
firm employs. 2286

2279

See Table 1 in section I.B.2.a. of this release.

2280

4,218 credit analysts x 5 hours = 21,090 hours.

2281

21,090 hours x 0.75 = 15,818 hours; 21,090 hours x 0.25 = 5,272 hours. These allocations remain
unchanged from the Commission’s preliminary allocation in the proposing release.

2282

5,272 hours x $400 = $2,108,800.

2283

4,218 credit analysts x 1 hour = 4,218 hours.

2284

4,218 hours x 0.75 = 3,164 hours; 4,218 hours x 0.25 = 1,054 hours.

2285

1,054 hours x $400 = $421,600. See Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507-4506 (providing an
estimate of $400 an hour engage outside professionals).

2286

See Table 1 in section I.B.2.a. of this release.

587

Accordingly, the Commission estimates that Rule 17g-9 will result in a total industrywide one-time hour burden for NRSROs to establish and document the standards of training,
experience, and competence for their credit analysts required under the rule and to establish
testing programs of approximately 18,818 hours, 2287 a total industry-wide one-time cost of
approximately $2,508,800 to hire outside professionals to assist in setting up training and testing
programs, 2288 a total industry-wide annual hour burden to maintain, review, update (if
necessary), and enforce the standards and to administer the training and testing programs of
approximately 3,914 hours, 2289 and a total industry-wide annual external cost of approximately
$521,600 to hire outside professionals to assist in reviewing and updating training and testing
programs. 2290
In addition, the Commission estimates that NRSROs will spend approximately five hours
per credit analyst per year to conduct periodic testing of their credit analysts, for a total industrywide annual hour burden to NRSROs of approximately 21,090 hours. 2291

New Rule 17g-10 and New Form ABS Due Diligence-15E

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. Rule 17g10 provides that the written certification a provider of third-party due diligence services must
provide to an NRSRO must be made on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2292
In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that there would be ten providers of
third-party due diligence services and each would spend an average of approximately 300 hours

2287

3,000 + 15,818 = 18,818.

2288

$400,000 + $2,108,800 = $2,508,800.

2289

750 + 3,164 = 3,914.

2290

$100,000 + $421,600 = $521,600.

2291

4,218 credit analysts x 5 hours = 21,090 hours.

per firm developing certain processes and protocols to provide the required information and
submit the certifications, and that 75% of these burden hours (225 hours) would be internal
burden and 25% of these burden hours (75 hours) would be external burden to hire outside
counsel to provide legal advice on the requirements of the new rule and form. 2293 The
Commission did not receive comment on these estimates. Further, the modifications to Rule
17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E from the proposal will not impact the one-time hour
burden or allocation of that burden to internal and external burdens because the modifications –
which create a “safe harbor” from the requirement to provide the forms to NRSROs – do not
require the third party due diligence provider to expend more effort to meet the statutory
requirement because they will make the process more certain and efficient. Consequently, the
processes and protocols to meet the safe harbor should be no more complex than would have
been the case if the provider of third-party due diligence services had to determine each NRSRO
that was producing a credit rating in order to provide the NRSRO with the certification as
required by 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act. For these reasons, the Commission is not
revising the estimated one-time and annual hour burdens for the providers of third-party due
diligence services.
However, the Commission now estimates that there are approximately fifteen providers
of third-party due diligence services. 2294 Accordingly, the Commission estimates that providers
of third-party due diligence services will spend an average of approximately 300 hours per firm
developing these processes and protocols, resulting in an industry-wide one-time hour burden for
providers of third-party due diligence services of approximately 4,500 hours. 2295 In addition, the

2293

2294

See section I.B.2.b. of this release.

2295

15 providers of third-party due diligence services x 300 hours = 4,500 hours. The estimate of 300 hours

589

Commission allocates 75% of these burden hours (3,375 hours) to internal burden and 25% of
these burden hours (1,125 hours) to external burden to hire outside counsel to provide legal
advice on the requirements of Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2296 The
Commission estimates $400 per hour for external costs for retaining outside counsel, resulting in
an industry-wide one-time cost of $450,000. 2297
With respect to the annual burden, the Commission stated in the proposing release that
the estimate should be based on the number of issuances per year of Exchange Act-ABS because
the requirement to produce the certification and provide it to NRSROs and issuers or
underwriters will be triggered when an issuer, underwriter, or NRSRO hires a provider of thirdparty due diligence services. The Commission estimated that a provider of third-party due
diligence services would spend approximately thirty minutes to complete and transmit Form
ABS Due Diligence-15E and that there would be an average of 2,067 Exchange Act-ABS
offerings per year, for an industry-wide annual burden of approximately 1,034 hours. 2298 The
Commission did not receive comments on this estimate. The Commission believes that the
modification to the proposal creating the “safe harbor” will decrease the annual burden as
compared to the burden estimated in the proposal. In particular, the provider of third-party due

remains unchanged from the Commission’s preliminary estimate in the proposing release. See Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33509. This estimate is based on the Commission’s
estimate for the amount of time it would take a securitizer to set-up a system to make the disclosures
required by Form ABS-15G. See Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507-4506. The Commission,
however, has reduced the hour estimate of 850 hours used for Form ABS-15G by approximately two-thirds
because information required to be provided in proposed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E is substantially
less detailed and complex than the information required in Form ABS-15G.
2296

4,500 hours x 0.75 = 3,375 hours; 4,500 hours x 0.25 = 1,150 hours. This allocation remains unchanged
from the Commission’s preliminary allocation in the proposing release.

2297

1,125 hours x $400 = $450,000. See Proposed Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations, 74 FR 63889 (providing an estimate of $400 per hour to engage outside counsel).

2298

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33509 (2,067 offerings x 30 minutes
= 1,034 hours).

diligence services in many cases may need to submit only one certification to another party;
namely, to the issuer or underwriter that maintains the Rule 17g-5 website. Without a safe
harbor, the third party would have needed to submit the certification to each NRSRO producing a
credit rating for the Exchange Act-ABS, which frequently would include two or more hired
NRSROs and possibly additional non-hired NRSROs. Moreover, the certainty of meeting the
“safe harbor” provisions will eliminate the additional time a third party may have spent seeking
to determine whether it has identified all NRSROs producing a credit rating and provided them
with the certification in accordance with its statutory obligation to provide the certification to
every NRSRO rating the applicable Exchange Act-ABS. For these reasons, the Commission
believes, based on staff experience, that the modifications will reduce the burden attributable to
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E from thirty minutes to twenty minutes to complete and transmit
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E.
The Commission estimates that there will be 715 Exchange Act-ABS offerings per
year. 2299 For these reasons, the Commission estimates that the industry-wide annual hour burden
for providers of third-party due diligence services resulting from Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS
Due Diligence-15E is approximately 238 hours. 2300
In summary, the Commission estimates that Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence15E will result in a total industry-wide one-time burden for providers of third-party due diligence
services to develop processes and protocols to provide the required information and submit the
certifications of approximately 3,375 hours, a total industry-wide one-time cost to hire outside
counsel to provide legal advice on the requirements of the new rule and form of approximately

2299

New Rule 15Ga-2 and Amendments to Form ABS-15G

The Commission is adopting Rule 15Ga-2 and amendments to Form ABS-15G. 2301 Rule
15Ga-2 requires an issuer or underwriter of certain Exchange Act-ABS that are to be rated by an
NRSRO to furnish the Commission with a Form ABS-15G on the Commission’s EDGAR
system containing the findings and conclusions of any third-party “due diligence report”
obtained by the issuer or underwriter at least five business days prior to the first sale in the
offering. Under the rule, the disclosure will be furnished using Form ABS-15G for both
registered and unregistered offerings of Exchange Act-ABS.
The final rule has been modified from the proposal to provide that if the disclosure
required by Rule 15Ga-2 has been made in the applicable prospectus, the issuer or underwriter
may refer to that section of the prospectus in Form ABS-15G rather than providing the findings
and conclusions directly in the form. It also has been modified to provide an exemption for
certain offshore issuances of Exchange Act-ABS. Further, the final rule has been modified so
that it does not apply to issuers or underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS, but section
15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act nonetheless requires an issuer or underwriter of these
securities to make publicly available the findings and conclusions of any third-party due
diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter.
The Commission estimated in the proposing release that the new rule and amended form
would result in a one-time hour burden to issuers and underwriters in offerings of registered and
unregistered Exchange Act-ABS in connection with developing processes and protocols to

2301

See section II.H.1. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this rule and form).

592

provide the required information to comply with the statutory disclosure requirement and Rule
15Ga-2, as applicable, including modifying their existing Form ABS-15G processes and
protocols to accommodate the requirements of Rule 15Ga-2. 2302 The Commission also estimated
that 270 unique issuers would be required to file the form. 2303 Finally, the Commission
estimated that each issuer would require approximately 100 hours to develop processes and
protocols to comply with Rule 15Ga-2 and to modify their existing Form ABS-15G processes
and protocols to provide for the disclosure of the information required pursuant to Rule 15Ga-2
and that this work would be done internally by issuers and underwriters. 2304
The Commission did not receive comments on these estimates. Further, the Commission
does not believe the modifications to the rule from the proposal will impact the one-time burden
because issuers and underwriters will still need to develop processes and protocols to provide the
required information to comply with Rule 15Ga-2, or section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act
in the case of issuers or underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS, including modifying their
existing Form ABS-15G processes and protocols to accommodate the requirements of Rule
15Ga-2 or the statute, as applicable. The Commission, however, is adjusting its estimate of the
number of unique issuers from approximately 270 to approximately 336 unique issuers that will
be required to file the form. 2305 Moreover, this estimate includes issuers and underwriters of

2302

See id. See also Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4506.

2304

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33510. This estimate was based on
the Commission’s estimate for the amount of time it would take a securitizer to set up a system to make the
disclosures required by Form ABS-15G as originally adopted by the Commission. See Disclosure for
Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507-4506. The Commission, however, estimated that the hour burden for
amending existing Form ABS-15G processes and protocols will be significantly lower than the estimate of
850 hours used to initially develop those processes and protocols. See Nationally Recognized Statistical
Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33510, n.1069.

2305

See Table 6 in section I.B.2.b. of this release. The Commission recognizes that underwriters also have a

593

municipal Exchange Act-ABS because, even though these offerings are excluded from Rule
15Ga-2, the statutory disclosure requirements apply to them. 2306 Consequently, the Commission
estimates an industry-wide one-time burden of approximately 33,600 hours. 2307
The annual PRA burden associated with Form ABS-15G reflects the burden associated
with preparing and furnishing the form on EDGAR. As noted above, the amendment to Form
ABS-15G will require that it be furnished by issuers and underwriters in offerings of certain
registered and unregistered Exchange Act-ABS. Consequently, the Commission believes that
the estimate of the annual hour burden for furnishing Form ABS-15G should be based on an
estimate of the number of Exchange Act-ABS offerings per year. In the proposing release, the
Commission estimated that, on average, there would be approximately 2,067 Exchange Act-ABS
offerings per year. 2308 As discussed above, the Commission now estimates that there will be
approximately 715 Exchange Act-ABS offerings. 2309 Further, the exemption for certain foreign
issued Exchange Act-ABS should reduce the number of Exchange Act-ABS offerings that
trigger the disclosure requirement. However, to be conservative, the Commission is retaining its
estimate of 2,067 Exchange Act offerings per year for purposes of the burden estimates.
requirement to furnish Form ABS-15G. However, for purposes of calculating PRA numbers, this
discussion is limited to issuers because, as discussed above in section II.H.1. of this release, only a single
Form ABS-15G is required to be furnished when the issuer and/or one or more underwriters have obtained
the same third-party due diligence report. See paragraph (b) of Rule 15Ga-2.
2306

Based on the Asset-Backed Alert database, the Commission estimates there were nine unique sponsors of
municipal Exchange Act-ABS in 2013.

2307

336 unique issuers x 100 hours = 33,600 hours.

2308

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33510. See also Disclosure for
Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507-4508. As noted above, issuers, underwriters, and NRSROs may not use
providers of third-party due diligence services with respect to every issuance of Exchange Act-ABS. For
example, the Commission believes that providers of third-party due diligence services are used primarily
for RMBS transactions. See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33471.
However, the Commission’s estimate uses the total number of estimated Exchange Act-ABS offerings (as
opposed to a lesser amount based on an estimate of RMBS offerings) because the use of providers of thirdparty due diligence services may migrate to other types of Exchange Act-ABS.

2309

See Table 6 in section I.B.2.b. of this release.

594

Moreover, this estimate includes offerings of municipal Exchange Act-ABS because, even
though these offerings are excluded from Rule 15Ga-2, the statutory disclosure requirement does
apply to them. 2310
In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that an issuer or underwriter would
spend approximately one hour completing and submitting Form ABS-15G for purposes of
meeting the requirement in Rule 15Ga-2 and that this work would be performed internally. 2311
The Commission based this estimate on the fact that Form ABS-15G will elicit much less
information when used solely for the purpose of complying with Rule 15Ga-2. 2312 In addition,
the Commission based this estimate on the fact that the information required in the form could be
drawn directly from the due diligence reports the Commission expects providers of third-party
due diligence services to generate with respect to their performance of due diligence services. 2313
The Commission did not receive comments on these estimates. The Commission
believes that the modification to the proposal providing that issuers and underwriters will not
need to provide the findings and conclusions directly in Form ABS-15G if the Rule 15Ga-2
disclosures are included in the applicable prospectus may decrease slightly the hour burden for
issuers and underwriters. However, this reduction in burden could be offset to the extent that
issuers and underwriters decide that they should keep a record to support their reliance on the
off-shore exemption and because the Commission eliminated the proposed ability for an issuer or
underwriter to rely on a representation from an NRSRO. Further, although Rule 15Ga-2

2310

Based on the Asset-Backed Alert database, the Commission estimates there were eleven separate offerings
of municipal Exchange Act-ABS in 2013.

2312

See id. See also Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 FR at 4507 (estimating thirty hours to prepare the form
when filed pursuant to Rule 15Ga-1).

2313

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33510.

595

excludes issuers and underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS, issuers and underwriters of
these securities will still incur costs to comply with the statutory disclosure obligation. Based on
staff experience, the Commission estimates that many of these issuers and underwriters are likely
to satisfy this obligation by furnishing Form ABS-15G on EMMA and that the time to prepare
and submit the form will be one hour (the same as the time to prepare and submit the form on
EDGAR). However, to the extent that these issuers and underwriters use another means to make
the required information publicly available, such as through a website, the burden could be
incrementally more or less, depending on the method chosen to disclose the information.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the industry-wide annual hour burden resulting from
Rule 15Ga-2 and the amendments to Form ABS-15G is approximately 715 hours. 2314
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission estimates that Rule 15Ga-2, the amendments
to Form ABS-15G, and section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act will result in a total industrywide one-time hour burden to develop processes and protocols to provide the required
information to comply with Rule 15Ga-2 and/or section 15E(s)(4)(A), including modifying their
existing Form ABS-15G processes and protocols to accommodate the requirements of Rule
15Ga-2, of approximately 33,600 hours and a total industry-wide annual hour burden to prepare
and make the required disclosures of approximately 715 hours for issuers and underwriters.
11.

Amendments to Regulation S-T

The Commission is requiring that certain Forms NRSRO (and applicable exhibits to the
form) and all Rule 17g-3 annual reports be submitted to the Commission electronically using the
Commission’s EDGAR system. 2315 In order to implement this requirement, the Commission is

2314

715 Exchange Act-ABS transactions x 1 hour = 715 hours.

2315

The Commission is allocating the one-time and annual hour burdens and costs of these requirements solely
to Rule 17g-1. See section IV.D.1. of this release.

596

adopting amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to require the electronic submission using
the EDGAR system of Form NRSRO (and applicable exhibits to the form) pursuant to
paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 and annual reports pursuant to Rule 17g-3. 2316
The Commission is adopting Rule 15Ga-2, which will require an issuer or underwriter of
any Exchange Act-ABS that is to be rated by an NRSRO to furnish a Form ABS-15G on the
EDGAR system containing the findings and conclusions of any third-party due diligence report
obtained by the issuer or underwriter. 2317
The amendments revise Regulation S-T. However, the collection of information
requirements are reflected in the burden hours estimated for Rule 17g-1 and Rule 15Ga-2. The
rules in Regulation S-T do not impose any separate burden. Consistent with historical practice,
the Commission has retained an estimate of one burden hour to Regulation S-T for
administrative convenience.
12.

Form ID

NRSROs will need to file a Form ID with the Commission in order to gain access to the
EDGAR system. Form ID is used to request the assignment of access codes to make
submissions on EDGAR. The current OMB approved hour burden for Form ID is fifteen
minutes per respondent. 2318 Thus, the Commission estimates that the total industry-wide onetime hour burden resulting from filing Form ID will be approximately two and a half hours. 2319
The Commission believes that the issuers and underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS that
will need to furnish Form ABS-15G to the Commission through the EDGAR system pursuant to

2316

See section II.L. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this amendment).

2317

See section II.H.1. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this rule and form).

2318

See Form ID (OMB Number 3235-0328).

2319

10 NRSROs x 15 minutes = 150 minutes; 150 minutes/60 minutes = 2.5 hours.

597

proposed Rule 15Ga-2 already have access to the EDGAR system because, for example, they
need such access for the purpose of Rule 15Ga-1. Consequently, they will not need to execute
and file Form ID as a result of Rule 15Ga-2.
13.

Total Paperwork Burdens

Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates that the total burden for purposes of
the PRA for NRSRO respondents resulting from the rule amendments and new rules will be
approximately 74,062 industry-wide one-time hours, 2320 $7,908,800 industry-wide external onetime costs, 2321 725,456 industry-wide annual hours, 2322 and $725,600 industry-wide external
annual costs. 2323 In addition, as discussed above, the Commission estimates that the burden
resulting from a request for an exemption under paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5 will be
approximately 150 hours in internal burden and $20,000 in external costs; and the burden
resulting from publishing information about material changes to an NRSRO’s credit rating
procedures and methodologies or a notice of significant errors identified in a procedure or
methodology as described in paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 17g-8 will be approximately twenty hours
in internal burden.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates that the total burden for purposes of
the PRA for respondents that are providers of third-party due diligence services resulting from
the rule amendments and new rules will be approximately 3,375 industry-wide one-time hours,
$450,000 industry-wide external one-time costs, and 238 industry-wide annual hours.

2320

690 + 2,531 + 200 + 6,720 + 1,250 + 37,500 + 1,350 + 5,000 + 18,818 + 2.5 = 74,061.5, rounded to 74,062.

2321

$400,000 + $5,000,000 + $2,508,800 = $7,908,800.

2322

690 + 1,015 + 50 + 1,650 + 695,347 + 450 + 1,250 + 3,914 + 21,090 = 725,456.

2323

$4,000 + $200,000 + $521,600 = $725,600.

598

Based on the foregoing, the Commission estimates that the total burden for purposes of
the PRA for issuer and underwriter respondents resulting from the rule amendments and new
rules will be approximately 33,600 industry-wide one-time hours and 834 industry-wide annual
hours. 2324
E.

COLLECTION OF INFORMATION IS MANDATORY

The collections of information pursuant to the rule amendments and new rules are
mandatory, as applicable, for NRSROs, providers of third-party due diligence services, and
issuers and underwriters.
F.

CONFIDENTIALITY

The Forms ABS-15G furnished to the Commission by issuers and underwriters of
offerings of asset-backed securities under Rule 15Ga-2 will be publicly available on the
Commission’s EDGAR system.
The Forms NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 to the form an NRSRO must submit to the
Commission electronically under the amendments to Rule 17g-1, Form NRSRO, and Regulation
S-T will be publicly available on the Commission’s EDGAR system. In addition, an NRSRO
must make its current Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form NRSRO publicly and
freely available on an easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website and must make
its most recently filed Exhibit 1 freely available in writing to any individual who requests a copy
under Rule 17g-1, as amended.
The records that an NRSRO must make and retain or retain under the amendments to
Rule 17g-2 will be made available to the Commission and its representatives as required in
connection with examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings.

2324

119 + 715 = 834.

599

The annual internal controls report an NRSRO must file with the Commission under
amendments to Rule 17g-3 will be generated from the internal records of the NRSRO. Under
paragraph (e) to Rule 17g-3, information in a report filed under Rule 17g-3 on a confidential
basis and for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to applicable
Commission rules will be afforded confidential treatment to the extent permitted by law.
The Forms ABS Due Diligence-15E that an issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of an assetbacked security posts on the password-protected Rule 17g-5 website under the amendments to
Rule 17g-5 will be made available to other NRSROs that provide the Commission with a
certification agreeing, among other things, to keep the information confidential. The
representations the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter provides to the NRSRO regarding the Rule
17g-5 website will not be made public, unless the parties choose to make them public.
An NRSRO may need to update its policies and procedures to address and manage
conflicts of interest in connection with the new absolutely prohibited conflict related to sales and
marketing in Rule 17g-5. An NRSRO is required to disclose its policies and procedures for
addressing and managing conflicts of interest in Exhibit 7 to Form NRSRO. An NRSRO
submitting an application for an exemption from the new absolutely prohibited conflict may
request that the application be afforded confidential treatment for a specified period of time, not
exceeding 120 days from the date of the Commission’s response. 2325 Otherwise, the application
for an exemption must be made public as soon as practicable after the response has been sent or
given to the NRSRO requesting it. 2326 If the Commission grants an exemption, the Commission
order granting the exemption will be publicly available on the Commission’s website.

2325

See 17 CFR 200.81(b).

2326

See 17 CFR 200.81(a).

600

The form and certifications an NRSRO must publish when taking certain rating actions
under paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 must be published in the same manner as the credit rating that
is the result or subject of the rating action and made available to the same persons who can
receive or access the credit rating. An NRSRO must publicly disclose credit rating histories
under paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 for free on an easily accessible portion of its Internet website.
The policies and procedures an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document
with respect to its procedures and methodologies to determine credit ratings under paragraph (a)
of Rule 17g-8 will be made available to the Commission and its representatives as required in
connection with examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. These policies and
procedures will be made public to the extent that an NRSRO is required to include them in
Exhibit 2 to Form NRSRO, which requires a general description of the procedures and
methodologies used by the NRSRO to determine credit ratings. In addition, under paragraph (a)
of Rule 17g-8, an NRSRO must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that
it promptly publishes on its Internet website material changes to the policies and procedures and
notice of a significant error in a procedure or methodology that may result in a change to current
credit ratings.
The policies and procedures an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and
document with respect to credit rating symbols under paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 will be made
available to the Commission and its representatives as required in connection with examinations,
investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Under paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8, an NRSRO
must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to include definitions of its credit rating
symbols in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO, which is publicly available.

601

The policies and procedures an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document
with respect to look-back reviews under paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 will be made available to
the Commission and its representatives as required in connection with examinations,
investigations, and enforcement proceedings. If a look-back review determines that a credit
rating was influenced by a conflict of interest, an NRSRO must promptly publish a revised credit
rating or an affirmation of the credit rating, as appropriate, which must be published in the same
manner as the credit rating that is the result or subject of the revision or affirmation and made
available to the same persons who can receive or access the credit rating.
The standards of training, experience, and competence an NRSRO must establish,
maintain, enforce, and document under Rule 17g-9 will be made available to the Commission
and its representatives as required in connection with examinations, investigations, and
enforcement proceedings.
Forms ABS Due Diligence-15E that third-party due diligence providers must
provide to an NRSRO that produces a credit rating of an Exchange Act-ABS to which the
due diligence services relate and to the issuer or underwriter of the security that maintains
the Rule 17g-5 website must be published by the NRSRO with certain rating actions,
including initial credit ratings, in the same manner as the credit rating that is the result or
subject of the rating action and made available to the same persons who can receive or
access the credit rating under paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7.
G.

RETENTION PERIOD OF RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS

The records that must be retained by an NRSRO under paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13),
(b)(14), and (b)(15) of Rule 17g-2 must be retained until three years after the date the record is

602

replaced with an updated record. All other records that an NRSRO must retain under Rule 17g-2
must be retained for three years after the record is made or received. 2327
There are no record retention requirements for providers of third-party due diligence
services or for the records issuers and underwriters are required to make and furnish to the
Commission pursuant to the requirements in Rule 15Ga-2 and the amendments to Form ABS15G.
V.

IMPLEMENTATION AND ANNUAL COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS
The purpose of this section is to present the Commission’s estimate of the costs of the

PRA burdens attributable to the amendments and new rules being adopting today. As indicated
in the discussion below, these costs include monitizations of PRA hour burdens and PRA
external costs estimated in section IV.D. of this release. The costs included in this section are
also noted and discussed in the focused economic analyses in section II of this release. 2328
A.

INTERNAL CONTROL STRUCTURE

The Commission is adding paragraph (a)(7) to Rule 17g-3. This paragraph requires an
NRSRO to include an additional report – a report on the NRSRO’s internal control structure
established under section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act – with its annual submission of
reports to the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3, and is amending paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3
to require the NRSRO’s CEO or, if the firm does not have a CEO, an individual performing
similar functions, to provide a signed statement that must be attached to the report. 2329 The
Commission estimates that paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 17g-3 and the amendment to paragraph (b)
2327

See paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2 as adopted.

2328

The focused economic analyses are provided in sections II.A.4., II.B.4., II.C.3., II.D.2., II.E.4., II.F.3.,
II.G.6., II.H.4., II.I.3., II.J.3., II.K.2., II.L.2., and II.M.5. of this release. These sections cross-reference the
costs estimated in this section.

See section II.A.3. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this amendment); section II.A.4.
of this release (providing a focused economic analysis for this amendment).

603

of Rule 17g-3 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs to engage outside
counsel to analyze the requirements for the internal controls report of approximately
$400,000 2330 and total industry-wide annual costs for NRSROs to prepare the internal controls
report and to engage outside counsel to assist in the preparation of the report of approximately
$667,000. 2331
The Commission is adding paragraph (b)(12) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the internal
control structure an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document under section
15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act as a record that must be retained. 2332 Under the amendments
to paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2, the record must be retained until three years after the date the
record is replaced with an updated record. The Commission estimates that paragraph (b)(12) of
Rule 17g-2 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs to update their record
retention policies and procedures to incorporate the new record of approximately $12,000 2333 and
total industry-wide annual costs for NRSROs to retain the record of approximately $3,000. 2334
B.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RELATING TO SALES AND MARKETING

The Commission is adding paragraph (c)(8) to Rule 17g-5. This paragraph prohibits an
NRSRO from issuing or maintaining a credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who

2330

See section IV.D.4. of this release (PRA analysis providing cost and hour burden estimates). The internal
cost to the NRSRO to prepare and file the first internal controls report is included in the annual cost.

2331

1,650 hours x $283 per hour for a compliance manager = $466,950 + $200,000 = $666,950, rounded to
$667,000. See section IV.D.4. of this release (PRA analysis providing cost and hour burden estimates). As
noted earlier, the salary figures provided in this release are from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for a 1,800-hour workyear and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.

2333

200 hours/5 records = 40 hours x $291 per hour for a senior systems analyst = $11,640, rounded to
$12,000. See section IV.D.3. of this release (PRA analysis providing cost and hour burden estimates).

2334

50 hours/5 records = 10 hours x $291 per hour for a senior systems analyst = $2,910, rounded to $3,000.

participates in determining or monitoring the credit rating, or developing or approving
procedures or methodologies used for determining the credit rating, including qualitative and
quantitative models, also: (1) participates in sales or marketing of a product or service of the
NRSRO or a product or service of an affiliate of the NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or
marketing considerations. 2335 The Commission is also adding paragraph (f) to Rule 17g-5,
which provides that upon written application by an NRSRO the Commission may exempt, either
unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, the NRSRO from paragraph (c)(8) of Rule
17g-5 if the Commission finds that due to the small size of the NRSRO it is not appropriate to
require the separation of the production of credit ratings from sales and marketing activities and
the exemption is in the public interest. 2336 The Commission estimates that paragraph (c)(8) of
Rule 17g-5 will impose total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs to update the NRSRO’s
conflicts of interest policies and procedures and to prepare and file an update of registration to
account for the update of the written policies and procedures of approximately $354,000. 2337
The Commission also estimates that the cost of drafting and submitting a written
application to the Commission under paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5, including the cost of engaging
outside counsel to assist in drafting the application, would be approximately $62,000. 2338

605

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-8. Paragraph (c) of the rule contains requirements
relating to the policies and procedures with respect to look-back reviews an NRSRO must
establish, maintain, and enforce under section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act. 2339 The
Commission is also adding paragraph (a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the policies and procedures
of an NRSRO with respect to look-back reviews as a record that must be made and retained. 2340
The Commission estimates that paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 will result in total industry-wide
one-time costs for NRSROs to establish and make a record of the policies and procedures of
approximately $283,000 2341 and total industry-wide annual costs for NRSROs of approximately
$71,000 2342 to review, to update (if necessary) the policies and procedures and the record
documenting the policies and procedures, to maintain and enforce the policies and procedures,
and to take steps pursuant to the policies and procedures when a look-back review determines
that a credit rating was influenced by a conflict.
The Commission estimates that paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 17g-2 will result in total
industry-wide one-time costs for an NRSRO to update its record retention policies and
procedures to incorporate the new record of approximately $12,000 2343 and total industry-wide
annual costs for an NRSRO to retain the record of approximately $3,000. 2344

paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2, the record must be retained until three years after the date it is replaced with
an updated record.

2341

1,000 hours x $283 per hour for a compliance manager = $283,000. See section IV.D.7. of this release
(PRA analysis providing cost and hour burden estimates).

2342

See section IV.D.3. of this release (PRA analysis providing cost and hour burden estimates).

606

D.

FINES AND OTHER PENALTIES

The Commission is amending the instructions for Form NRSRO by adding instruction
A.10, which provides notice to credit rating agencies applying for registration as NRSROs and
NRSROs that an NRSRO is subject to the fine and penalty provisions and other available
sanctions in sections 15E, 21, 21A, 21B, 21C, and 32 of the Exchange Act for violations of the
securities laws. 2345 The Commission believes that this amendment will not result in additional
regulatory obligations for NRSROs.
E.

ENHANCEMENTS TO DISCLOSURES OF PERFORMANCE
STATISTICS

The Commission is amending the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. 2346 The
amendments standardize the production and presentation of the 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year
transition and default statistics that an NRSRO must disclose in the Exhibit. The performance
statistics must be presented in a format specified in the instructions, which include a sample
“Transition/Default Matrix.” The amendments also will enhance the information to be disclosed
by, for example, requiring statistics to be produced and presented for subclasses of structured
finance products and for credit ratings where the obligor or obligation paid off or the credit rating
was withdrawn for reasons other than a default or the obligor or obligation paying off.
The Commission estimates that the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1
requiring standardized “Transition/Default Matrices” and prescribing the method of calculating
transition and default rates will result in total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs to
establish systems for determining performance statistics according to the amended instructions of

2345

See section II.D. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this amendment).

2346

See section II.E.1. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the amendments) section II.E.4.
of this release (providing a focused economic analysis for these amendments).

607

approximately $737,000 2347 and total industry-wide annual costs for NRSROs to calculate and
format the performance statistics according to the amended instructions for Exhibit 1 of
approximately $295,000. 2348 The costs associated with calculating and presenting these
performance statistics will depend in part on the number of obligors, securities, and money
market instruments assigned credit ratings by the NRSRO.
Under the amendments to paragraph (i) of Rule 17g-1, NRSROs are required to make
Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 through 9 freely available on an easily accessible portion of their
corporate Internet website and to provide a paper copy of Exhibit 1 to individuals who request a
paper copy. 2349 The Commission estimates that re-configuring a corporate Internet website for
this purpose will result in total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs of approximately
$10,000. 2350 The Commission estimates that the requirement to send a paper copy of Exhibit 1
on request will result in total industry-wide costs for NRSROs to establish procedures and
protocols for receiving and processing requests for a paper copy of Exhibit 1 of approximately
$140,000 2351 and total industry-wide annual costs for NRSROs to process requests for a paper
copy of Exhibit 1 and for postage costs to send the paper copy of approximately $121,000. 2352

608

The Commission is amending Rule 17g-7 to recodify, in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7, the
requirements for NRSROs to disclose credit rating histories formerly prescribed in paragraph
(d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 and to substantially enhance the requirements. 2353 Paragraph (b) of Rule
17g-7 also increases the amount of information that must be disclosed by expanding the scope of
the credit ratings that must be included in the histories and by adding additional data elements
that must be disclosed in the rating history for a particular credit rating.
The Commission estimates that the amendments will result in total industry-wide onetime costs for NRSROs registered with the Commission to program existing systems and initially
add the ratings histories for all applicable outstanding credit ratings of approximately
$393,000 2354 and total industry-wide annual costs to comply with the increased requirements,
including updating and administering the database, of approximately $131,000. 2355

CREDIT RATING METHODOLOGIES

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-8. Paragraph (a) of the rule requires an NRSRO
to have policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies the NRSRO
uses to determine credit ratings. 2356 The Commission estimates that this requirement will result
in total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs of approximately $566,000 2357 to establish
and document the policies and procedures and total industry-wide annual costs for NRSROs to

approximately $142,000. 2358
In addition, the Commission estimates that an NRSRO will spend an average of
approximately $5,700 2359 to promptly publish on an easily accessible portion of its website
information about material changes to procedures and methodologies and the likelihood such
changes will result in changes to any current ratings, or notice of significant errors identified in a
procedure or methodology.
The Commission is adding paragraph (b)(13) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the policies and
procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies used to determine credit ratings an
NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce and document pursuant to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8
as a record that must be retained. 2360 The Commission estimates that paragraph (b)(13) of Rule
17g-2 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs for an NRSRO to update its record
retention policies and procedures to incorporate the new record of approximately $12,000 2361
and total industry-wide annual costs for an NRSRO to retain the record of approximately $3,000.
H.

FORM AND CERTIFICATION TO ACCOMPANY CREDIT RATINGS

The Commission is amending paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7 to require NRSROs, when
taking certain rating actions, to publish a form containing information about the credit rating
resulting from or subject to the rating action and any certification of a provider of third-party due

diligence services received by the NRSRO that relates to the credit rating. 2362 The Commission
estimates that the amendments will result in total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs of
approximately $15,613,000 to develop the standardized disclosures and create the systems,
protocols, and procedures for populating the form with information generated and collected
during the rating process, including the cost of engaging outside professionals (counsel and
information technology consultants) to assist in developing the standardized disclosures and
creating the systems, protocols, and procedures for populating the form with information
generated and collected during the rating process, 2363 and total industry-wide annual costs for
NRSROs of approximately $196,783,000 to update standardized disclosures, to tailor disclosures
to particular rating actions and asset classes, and to generate and publish each form and attach
the required certifications to the form. 2364
I.

NEW RULE 15Ga-2 AND AMENDMENTS TO FORM ABS-15G

The Commission is adopting Rule 15Ga-2 and amendments to Form ABS-15G. Rule
15Ga-2 generally requires an issuer or underwriter of any Exchange Act-ABS that is to be rated
by an NRSRO to furnish a Form ABS-15G on the EDGAR system containing the findings and
conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter at least
five business days prior to the first sale in the offering. 2365 The rule does not apply to issuers or
underwriters of municipal Exchange Act-ABS but section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act

The Commission estimates that Rule 15Ga-2 and amendments to Form ABS-15G will
result in total industry-wide one-time costs for issuers and underwriters to develop processes and
protocols to provide the required information to comply with Rule 15Ga-2 and/or section
15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act, including modifying their existing Form ABS-15G processes
and protocols to accommodate the requirements of Rule 15Ga-2, of approximately
$9,509,000 2366 and total industry-wide annual costs for issuers and underwriters to make the
disclosures as required by Rule 15Ga-2 and/or section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act of
approximately $202,000. 2367
J.

NEW RULE 17g-10 AND NEW FORM ABS DUE DILIGENCE-15E

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E, which
requires that the written certification a provider of third-party due diligence services must
provide to an NRSRO be made on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2368
The Commission estimates that Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E will
result in total industry-wide one-time costs for providers of third-party due diligence services of
approximately $1,405,000 2369 to develop processes and protocols to provide the required
information and submit the certifications and to hire outside counsel to provide legal advice on

the requirements of the new rule and form and total industry-wide annual costs for providers of
third-party due diligence services of approximately $67,000 2370 to provide the required
information and submit the certifications.
The Commission is adding paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E) to Rule 17g-5 to require an NRSRO to
obtain an additional representation from the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of an asset-backed
security that the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter will post on the Rule 17g-5 website, promptly
after receipt, any executed Form ABS Due Diligence-15E delivered by a person employed to
provide third-party due diligence services with respect to the security. 2371 This provision, which
was not included in the proposal, may require redrafting of NRSRO agreement templates. In
addition, issuers, sponsors and underwriters will incur recurring costs resulting from posting the
certifications to the Rule 17g-5 website. The Commission estimates paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E) of
Rule 17g-5 will result in total industry-wide one-time costs for NRSROs of approximately
$1,902,000 2372 to redraft the agreement templates they use with respect to obtaining
representations from issuers, sponsors, or underwriters as required under Rule 17g-5 and total
industry-wide annual costs for issuers, sponsors, and underwriters of approximately $34,000 to
upload each form and post it to the website. 2373

individuals it employs to participate in the determination of credit ratings that are reasonably
designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produce accurate credit ratings in the classes
of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 2374
The Commission estimates that Rule 17g-9 will result in total industry-wide one-time
costs for NRSROs to establish and document the standards of training, experience, and
competence for their credit analysts required under the rule and to establish testing programs,
including the cost to hire outside professionals to assist in setting up training and testing
programs, of approximately $7,834,000 2375 and total industry-wide annual costs for NRSROs of
approximately $1,629,000 to maintain, review, update (if necessary), and enforce the standards
and to administer the training and testing programs, including the cost to hire outside
professionals to assist in reviewing and updating training and testing programs. 2376 In addition,
the Commission estimates that Rule 17g-9 will result in total industry-wide annual costs for
NRSROs to conduct periodic testing of their credit analysts of approximately $5,990,000. 2377
The Commission is adding paragraph (b)(15) of Rule 17g-2 to identify the records
documenting the standards of training, experience, and competence as a record that must be
retained. 2378 The Commission estimates that paragraph (b)(15) of Rule 17g-2 will result in total

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 2390 requires Federal agencies, in promulgating
rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities.
The Commission proposed amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T, Rule 201 of
Regulation S-T, Rule 314 of Regulation S-T, Rule 17g-1, Rule 17g-2, Rule 17g-3, Rule 17g-5,
Rule 17g-6, Rule 17g-7, Form ABS-15G, and Form NRSRO, and proposed new Rule 17g-8, new
Rule 17g-9, new Rule 17g-10, new Rule 15Ga-2, and new Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. The
Commission included an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) in the proposing
release. 2391 The Commission has prepared this Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in
accordance with the provisions of the RFA. 2392
A.

NEED FOR AND OBJECTIVES OF THE AMENDMENTS AND
NEW RULES

Section II of this release describes the need for and objectives of the amendments and
new rules. In addition, section IV.B. of this release describes the intended use of the collections
of information that are required under the amendments and new rules. Moreover, as described in
section II of this release, the amendments and new rules implement Title IX, Subtitle C of the
Dodd-Frank Act. 2393 In section 931 of Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress
made findings relating to the need for the amendments and new rules. 2394
B.

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES RAISED BY PUBLIC COMMENTS

The Commission requested comment with regard to all matters discussed in the IRFA,
including comments with respect to the number of small entities that may be affected by the

617

proposed amendments and new rules and whether the effect on small entities would be
economically significant. 2395
One commenter addressed the IRFA stating that “the majority of the proposed rules set
forth in the Proposing Release are more appropriate for, and aimed at, large, established agencies
and overall, insufficient consideration has been given to smaller agencies.” 2396 The Commission
is sensitive to the impact the amendments and new rules will have on small entities and has taken
actions to address this issue. Specifically, the amendments and new rules contain certain
modifications from the proposals designed to alleviate some of the concerns regarding small
entities. The Commission believes that the amendments and new rules being adopted today, as
modified from the proposal, strike an appropriate balance between minimizing the impact on
small entities and implementing the policies and requirements addressed by Title IX, Subtitle C
of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Moreover, in response to the commenter that specifically addressed the IRFA, the
Commission believes the choices it has made in implementing Title IX, Subtitle C of the DoddFrank Act have resulted in amendments and new rules that are designed to be appropriate for
entities of all sizes, while still implementing the policies and requirements addressed by the
Dodd-Frank Act. For example, a number of the amendments and new rules are policies and
procedures-based requirements and, consequently, a small NRSRO can comply with these
requirements by tailoring and scaling its policies and procedures to its size and business
activities. In addition, where feasible, the Commission has implemented Title IX, Subtitle C of
the Dodd-Frank Act by enhancing existing requirements (most particularly with respect to
2395

See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, 76 FR at 33537.

2396

See Trade Metrics Letter. As noted below, other commenters addressed more generally issues related to
the impact on small entities, which are discussed above in the relevant sections, as well as below in this
analysis. See, e.g., Kroll Letter.

618

performance statistics and rating histories) rather than establishing separate new requirements.
Consequently, small NRSROs that currently are subject to the existing requirements can leverage
their existing systems and procedures to comply with the new requirements and will not be
subject to separate new requirements. Moreover, the Commission has implemented Title IX,
Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act, in large part, by designing amendments and new rules that are
modeled closely on the statutory text mandating the rulemaking. Consequently, the Commission
has sought to limit the cumulative impact on small NRSRO resulting from the amendments and
new rules to that which is necessary to implement the policies and requirements addressed by
Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act. Finally, the Commission – as discussed in section III
of this release – has prescribed differing dates for when the amendments and new rules will
become effective, with the more technically complex amendments and rules having longer lead
times before they become effective. This will provide all entities – including entities that are
small NRSROs – with transition periods to prepare to comply with the new requirements, which
may be particularly helpful to small NRSROs.
While the Commission has sought to limit the impact on small entities, the Commission
acknowledges that Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act contains requirements – including
those resulting from this substantial package of rulemaking – that collectively and, in many
cases, individually will impose costs on NRSROs, including NRSROs that are small entities.
The Commission recognizes that the consequences of these amendments and new rules may be
the creation of barriers to entry and negative impacts on competition. The Commission has
balanced these potential impacts with the rulemaking requirements and objectives of Title IX,
Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act (reflected in the findings in section 931 of the Dodd-Frank
Act).

619

In addition to the comment discussed above that specifically addressed the IRFA, several
commenters discussed the potential impact of the proposed amendments and new rules on small
entities. These comments – and the Commission’s response to the comments – are discussed in
the various, relevant sections throughout this release, as well as below.
One commenter, with regard to the proposals relating to the internal control structure,
stated that the Commission should “avoid creating a regulatory environment for NRSROs that is
so burdensome and complicated that only the large NRSROs, which have enormous resources at
their disposal, can address the multitude of complex requirements” and that the proposed
amendments to Rule 17g-3 related to internal controls would compound barriers to entry because
they are “expensive and burdensome to implement,” particularly for newer or smaller
NRSROs. 2397 Commenters also stated, in response to a question in the proposing release, that
the Commission should not prescribe factors for an internal control structure because this would
place a heavy burden on small NRSROs.2398 One commenter stated that the requirement to
document internal controls is burdensome, particularly for smaller NRSROs, that the
requirements are expensive, time consuming, and yield little benefit, and that documenting
policies and procedures “naturally coincide with the establishment of a properly functioning
internal controls structure,” which the NRSRO should be allowed to establish on its own, and the
commenter urged the Commission to exclude “extensive or overly-inclusive documentation
requirements” should it adopt paragraph (b)(12) of Rule 17g-2. 2399
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that the approach it has taken with
respect to section 15E(c)(3) of the Exchange Act – which contains a self-executing requirement

2397

See Kroll Letter.

2398

See A.M. Best Letter; Kroll Letter.

2399

See A.M. Best Letter.

620

that an NRSRO establish, maintain, enforce, and document an effective internal control structure
governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for
determining credit ratings – will reduce the impact on small NRSROs as compared to the
proposal. 2400 First, while the Commission is prescribing factors an NRSRO must consider, it is
not mandating that a specific factor be implemented. Consequently, while small NRSROs must
consider the factors identified by the Commission, they can tailor and scale their internal control
structures to their size and business activities. Second, the modifications to the amendments to
Rule 17g-3 from the proposal (because they specify that management of the NRSRO cannot state
in the internal controls report that the internal control structure was effective if it contained one
or more material weaknesses and provide a description of when a material weakness exists) will
provide better guidance to NRSROs on the statements and information that must be included in
the report compared with the proposal. Consequently, modifications may result in modest
reductions of the impact on small NRSROs associated with preparing the reports, as this
guidance will provide more certainty as to the matters that must be specifically addressed in the
reports and, therefore, reduce the effort needed to prepare them. 2401
One commenter stated that the prohibited conflict of interest related to sales and
marketing in proposed paragraph (c)(8) of Rule 17g-5 could make compliance “a practical
impossibility” for all but the largest NRSROs because small NRSROs do not have the same
resources or structure as larger NRSROs to comply with an absolute prohibition. 2402 Similarly,
another commenter stated that the proposed rule regarding the prohibited conflict of interest

2400

approach with respect to section 15E(c)(3)).

related to sales and marketing is overly-restrictive, particularly for smaller NRSROs, and would
result in “grossly inefficient use of the [NRSRO’s] resources and add a substantial amount of
infrastructure costs, at little to no benefit.” 2403
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that, consistent with Exchange Act
section 15E(h)(3)(B)(i), the final amendments provide a mechanism for small NRSROs to apply
for an exemption from the rule’s requirements. 2404 Under the final amendments, the
Commission may grant an exemption if it finds that due to the small size of the NRSRO it is not
appropriate to require the separation within the NRSRO of the production of credit ratings from
sales and marketing activities and such exemption is in the public interest. 2405
An NRSRO stated that complying with the amended instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form
NRSRO regarding the production and presentation of performance statistics will require
“substantial technology resources” and that smaller NRSROs’ resources may be strained if
sufficient time is not provided to comply. 2406 One commenter stated that the single cohort
approach could lead to results that are “significantly more volatile within the shorter time period,
which will make interpreting those results more difficult.” 2407 This commenter stated further that
“the volatility impact will be amplified for NRSROs with fewer ratings, which could lead to bias
against smaller NRSROs.” 2408
In response to the first comment, the Commission notes – as discussed in section III. of
this release – NRSROs will not be required to provide performance statistics in Exhibit 1 to

Form NRSRO that adhere to the new requirements until they file their annual certifications in
2016. This will provide all NRSROs, including small NRSROs, with a substantial transition
period to prepare to comply with the new requirements. In response to the second comment, the
Commission – as discussed in section II.E.1.b. of this release – has balanced this concern with
section (q)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which provides that the Commission’s rules shall require
that the performance measurement disclosures be clear and informative for investors having a
wide range of sophistication). 2409 The single cohort approach involves simpler computations
than other approaches for calculating the performance statistics. The requirements in the
instructions for Exhibit 1 provide for very transparent disclosures about the number of credit
ratings in the start date cohort and in the cohort for each notch in the credit rating scale of a given
class or subclass. This transparency will provide persons reviewing the performance statistics
with information to assess how the small number of credit rating ratings in a given cohort may
have impacted the results. 2410 Further, the modifications to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form
NRSRO permit an NRSRO, including a small NRSRO, to include in the exhibit a short statement
describing the single cohort approach and any advantages or limitations to the single cohort
approach the NRSRO believes would be appropriate to disclose.
The Commission also notes that it has modified the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form
NRSRO from the proposal in ways that will reduce the impact on small NRSROs. 2411 For
example, the final amendments provide that, except for the issuers of asset-backed securities
class of credit ratings, to determine the number of credit ratings outstanding as of the beginning
of the applicable period, the NRSRO must include only credit ratings assigned to an obligor as

an entity or, if there is no such rating, the rating of the obligor’s senior unsecured debt, instead of
the credit ratings of individual securities or money-market instruments issued by the obligor. 2412
Because the Commission has narrowed the scope of the credit ratings included in the
performance statistics for four of the five classes of credit ratings, this is expected to
substantially reduce the amount of historical information that an NRSRO is required to analyze.
The Commission has also revised the standard definition of paid off, in response to comment, 2413
to eliminate the prong that applied to entity ratings of obligors. The Commission has clarified
that the rule does not require an NRSRO to track the outcome of an obligor, security, or money
market instrument after the credit rating has been withdrawn, in response to comments. 2414
With respect to paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 17g-8, one NRSRO stated that to adopt
policies mandating board approval of procedures and methodologies to determine credit ratings
would be “overly-burdensome for many smaller NRSROs and likely cost prohibitive for a small
credit rating agency seeking to become an NRSRO.” 2415 A second commenter stated that certain
provisions of the proposal, including those related to credit rating methodologies, would
compound barriers to entry, that many of the new provisions are “expensive and burdensome to
implement,” especially for newer and smaller NRSROs, and do not appear to promote
competition, and that the Commission should take into account the “dominance” of the larger
players and expand small company exceptions that are “needed to level the competitive
field.” 2416

In response to comments about the board’s role in approving the procedures and
methodologies an NRSRO uses to determine credit ratings, the Commission notes – as discussed
in section II.F.1. of this release – that section 15E(t)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act provides that the
board of an NRSRO shall oversee the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of policies
and procedures for determining credit ratings. 2417 Consequently, the self-executing requirement
in the statute governs the responsibility of the board. Paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 17g-8 governs the
responsibility of the NRSRO to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that
board carries out this statutory responsibility. Therefore, the rule implements a policies and
procedures-based requirement and, therefore, a small NRSRO can comply with the rule
requirements by tailoring and scaling its policies and procedures to its size and business
activities. Moreover, with respect to the self-executing requirement, section 15E(t)(5) of the
Exchange Act provides exception authority under which the Commission may permit an NRSRO
to delegate responsibilities required in section 15E(t) to a committee if the Commission finds that
compliance with the provisions of that section present an unreasonable burden on a small
NRSRO. 2418 The ability to request an exception under section 15E(t)(5) provides a means for a
small NRSRO to seek relief to delegate responsibilities to a committee if the Commission finds
the costs and burdens associated with the requirements of section 15E(t) of the Exchange Act –
including the requirement that the board oversee the establishment, maintenance, and
enforcement of the policies and procedures for determining credit ratings – are an unreasonable
burden. 2419

The Commission will handle such requests in a manner similar to requests for relief under section 36 of the
Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78mm. Further information about requesting relief from the Commission
under section 36 of the Exchange Act is available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/exempt.shtml.

625

In response to the more general comment on the impact of paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 on
smaller NRSROs, all of the provisions in the paragraph establish policies and procedures-based
requirements. Therefore, a small NRSRO can comply with the requirements by tailoring and
scaling its policies and procedures to its size and business activities. This should result in lower
impacts on smaller NRSROs as compared to large NRSROs because the smaller NRSROs issue
substantially fewer credit ratings than the large NRSROs. 2420 Consequently, the number of
credit analysts and credit ratings to which the policies and procedures will need to be applied will
be significantly fewer than will be the case for a large NRSRO. Thus, the new rule should result
in lower impacts for small NRSROs in terms of the scope of the activities to be addressed by the
policies and procedures.
One NRSRO stated that the implementation of proposed paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-7
(requiring the publication of a form and any applicable due diligence certifications with the
taking of a rating action) would result in an “enormous technological undertaking” that will
require a lead time of at least one year to implement for all NRSROs and possibly longer for
smaller NRSROs who may not have the same level of financial or technological resources as the
larger NRSROs. 2421
In response to this comment, the Commission notes – as discussed in section III of this
release – that the requirement will not be effective until nine months after this release is
published in the Federal Register. This will provide small NRSROs with a substantial transition
period to prepare to comply with the new requirements. Moreover, while the transition period is
not as long as suggested by the commenter (at least one year), the Commission has modified the

2420

See Table 4 in section I.B.2.a. of this release (showing the approximate number of credit ratings
outstanding across the ten NRSROs).

2421

See Morningstar Letter.

626

final amendments from the proposal in a number of ways that will reduce impacts on small
NRSROs and, therefore, should make a nine month transition period sufficient for small
NRSROs. 2422 All of these modifications were made, in part, in response to concerns about
burdens raised by commenters. The modifications include narrowing the scope of rating actions
that will trigger the disclosure requirement. In addition, the Commission has exempted certain
rating actions involving credit ratings assigned to foreign obligors or securities or money market
instruments issued overseas. The Commission also significantly reduced the reporting
requirements relating to representations, warranties, and enforcement mechanisms. These
modifications should reduce the impact on all NRSROs, including small NRSROs, as compared
with the proposal.
While commenters may not have specifically addressed the impact on small entities of
other amendments and new rules being adopted today, as discussed in detail in Section II of this
release, the Commission has made modifications from the proposals that will reduce the impact
on small entities.
For example, the Commission has modified the requirement to submit certain Forms
NRSRO and annual reports under Rule 17g-3 to the Commission electronically. 2423 In response
to a comment from an NRSRO that the Commission’s proposed cost estimate for the proposal
“accounts for only a small fraction of the expected cost of compliance” and that instead PDF
copies of the required submissions should be used, 2424 the Commission has modified the
proposed amendments to require that the electronic submissions be made on EDGAR as PDF
documents, which another NRSRO described as “the most preferred and simplest” way to

2424

627

provide the information. 2425 This will mitigate the costs for all NRSROs, including small
NRSROs, to file the forms and report.
Further, the Commission has modified proposed paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 (the 100%
Rule) in a number of ways that will reduce the impact on small NRSROs. 2426 To focus the
disclosure of rating histories on the rating actions that are most relevant to evaluating
performance, the final rule eliminates the proposed requirement to include placements on watch
and affirmations (and the required data associated with these actions) in the rating histories. The
final rule also significantly shortens from the proposal the time horizon of historical information
that must be retrieved for inclusion in the rating histories. In particular, the proposed
requirement to include information for all credit ratings outstanding on or after June 26, 2007 has
been replaced with a standard three-year backward looking requirement that applies irrespective
of when the NRSRO is registered in a class of credit ratings. This, together with the elimination
of two proposed types of rating actions that would trigger a requirement to add information to a
credit rating’s history – placements of the security on credit watch or review and affirmations of
the credit rating –is expected to significantly mitigate the costs of retrieving and analyzing
historical information for the purposes of making the rating histories disclosures. The
modifications from the proposal also should mitigate concerns about having to obtain
information that was not traditionally retained by the NRSRO because it will significantly
narrow the scope of such information that will need to be included in the rating histories.
Further, the modifications from the proposal are expected to reduce the cost of updating the
XBRL data file with new information. 2427 The final amendments also specify a standard for

2425

2426

See section II.E.3. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of these modifications).

2427

See section II.E.3.b. of this release (discussing how the modifications narrow the types of rating actions

628

updating the file – no less frequently than monthly. This will mitigate costs that would result if
the Commission had not established a minimum requirement for how often the file must be
updated and NRSROs updated the file more frequently than monthly as a result. Finally, the
final rule modifies the proposal to reduce the time period a credit rating history must be retained
after the credit rating is withdrawn from twenty years to fifteen years. This is expected to reduce
to some degree the data retention and maintenance costs associated with the final rule as
compared to the proposed rule. Overall, these modifications are expected to reduce the impact
on NRSROs, including small NRSROs, as compared with the proposal.
The Commission also has modified proposed Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence15E in ways that will reduce the impact on small entities. 2428 In particular, Rule 17g-10, as
adopted, establishes a “safe harbor” to provide certainty to providers of third-party due diligence
services with respect to how they can meet their obligation under section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the
Exchange Act to provide Form ABS Due Diligence-15E to any NRSRO that produces a credit
rating to which the due diligence services relate. Consequently, small third-party due diligence
providers will not be required to identify every NRSRO that is producing a credit rating.
Finally, the amendments being adopted today eliminate the 10% Rule. 2429 This will
eliminate the costs for all NRSROs, including small NRSROs, to produce and disclose rating
histories to comply with the 10% Rule.

NRSROs and Providers of Third-Party Due Diligence Services

Paragraph (a) of Rule 0-10 provides that, for purposes of the RFA, a small entity “[w]hen
used with reference to an ‘issuer’ or a ‘person’ other than an investment company” means “an
‘issuer’ or ‘person’ that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, had total assets of $5
million or less.” 2430 The Commission has stated in the past that an NRSRO with total assets of
$5 million or less would qualify as a “small” entity for purposes of the RFA. 2431 The
Commission continues to believe this threshold of total assets of $5 million or less qualifies an
NRSRO as “small” for purposes of the RFA. In addition, the Commission believes this is an
appropriate threshold for determining whether a provider of third-party due diligence services is
“small” for purposes of the RFA. Currently, there are ten credit rating agencies registered with
the Commission as NRSROs. 2432 Based on their annual reports under Rule 17g-3 for the 2013
fiscal year, two NRSROs are small entities under the above definition.
The Commission stated in the proposing release that it believed that there were
approximately ten firms that provide, or would begin providing, third-party due diligence
services to issuers and underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS and that all would be small entities
for purposes of the RFA. 2433 However, based on further analysis, the Commission estimates that
there are approximately fifteen providers of third-party due diligence services. 2434 The
Commission believes that all of these firms will be small entities for purposes of the RFA.

Issuers

As noted above, Rule 0-10(a) 2435 defines an issuer be a small business or small
organization if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal
year. In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that there were 270 issuers and
certified pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that Rule 15Ga-2 and the amendments to Form ABS-15G,
if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 2436 The Commission requested comment on this certification. 2437 However, no
commenters responded to that request or indicated that the proposed rules would have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The Commission estimates that there will be 336 unique issuers subject to Rule 15Ga-2
and the amendments to Form ABS-15G. 2438 The Commission’s data indicate that only one
issuer would be small for purposes of the RFA. 2439 Because only one out of 336 unique issuers is
small and because commenters did not indicate that the proposed rules would have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small issuers, the Commission certifies that Rule
15Ga-2 and the amendments to Form ABS-15G will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities.

In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and to enhance oversight of NRSROs, the
Commission is adopting amendments to existing rules and new rules that apply to NRSROs,
providers of third-party due diligence services for asset-backed securities, and issuers and
underwriters of asset-backed securities.
The Commission is amending Rule 17g-1. First, the Commission is amending paragraph
(i) of Rule 17g-1. 2440 The amendments require an NRSRO to make Form NRSRO and Exhibits
1 through 9 of the form publicly and freely available on an easily accessible portion of its
corporate Internet website (eliminating an option to make the form and exhibits available
“through another comparable, readily accessible means”) and to make its most recent Exhibit 1
freely available in writing to any individual who requests a copy of the Exhibit.
Second, the Commission is amending paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 to require
NRSROs to use the Commission’s EDGAR system to electronically submit Form NRSRO and
required exhibits to the form to the Commission as PDF documents in the format required by the
EDGAR Filer Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. 2441
The Commission is amending the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO. 2442 The
amendments standardize the production and presentation of the 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year
transition and default statistics that an NRSRO must disclose in the Exhibit. The performance
statistics must be presented in a format specified in the instructions, which include a sample
“Transition/Default Matrix.” The amendments also enhance the information to be disclosed by,
for example, requiring statistics to be produced and presented for subclasses of structured finance

products and for credit ratings where the obligation was paid off or the credit rating was
withdrawn for reasons other than a default or the obligation was paid off.
The Commission is amending Rule 17g-2. First, the Commission is adding paragraph
(a)(9) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the policies and procedures with respect to look-back reviews an
NRSRO is required to establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the
Exchange Act and paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 as a record that must be made and retained. 2443
Second, the Commission is adding paragraph (b)(12) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the internal
control structure an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to section
15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act as a record that must be retained. 2444 Third, the Commission
is adding paragraph (b)(13) to Rule 17g-2 to identify the policies and procedures with respect to
the procedures and methodologies used to determine credit ratings an NRSRO is required to
establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 as a record
that must be retained. 2445 Fourth, the Commission is adding paragraph (b)(14) to Rule 17g-2 to
identify the policies and procedures with respect to credit rating symbols, numbers, or scores an
NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g8 as a record that must be retained. 2446 Fifth, the Commission is adding paragraph (b)(15) to
Rule 17g-2 to identify the standards of training, experience, and competence for credit analysts
an NRSRO must establish, maintain, enforce, and document pursuant to Rule 17g-9 as a record
that must be retained. 2447 In addition, the Commission is amending paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-2
to provide that records identified in paragraphs (a)(9), (b)(12), (b)(13), (b)(14), and (b)(15) of

Rule 17g-2 must be retained until three years after the date the record is replaced with an updated
record, instead of three years after the record is made or received, which is the retention period
for other records identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-2. 2448 The Commission also
repealed paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g-2 (the 10% Rule) and has re-codified (with significant
amendments) the requirements in paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 (the 100% Rule) in paragraph
(b) of Rule 17g-7. 2449
The Commission is amending Rule 17g-3. First, the Commission is amending
paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 17g-3. 2450 The amendment to paragraph (a) adds paragraph (a)(7)
to require an NRSRO to include an additional unaudited report – a report on the NRSRO’s
internal control structure – with its annual submission of reports to the Commission pursuant to
Rule 17g-3. 2451 The amendment to paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-3 requires that the NRSRO’s CEO
or, if the firm does not have a CEO, an individual performing similar functions, must provide a
signed statement attesting to information in the report that must be attached to the report. 2452
Second, the Commission is adding paragraph (d) to Rule 17g-3 to require that the annual
reports required to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to Rule 17g-3 be submitted
electronically through the Commission’s EDGAR system as PDF documents. 2453
Third, the Commission is adding paragraph (a)(8) to Rule 17g-3 to identify the report of
the NRSRO’s designated compliance officer that an NRSRO is required to file with the
Commission pursuant to section 15E(j)(5)(B) of the Exchange Act as a report that must be filed

with the other annual reports. 2454 This aspect of the requirement will not result in a collection of
information requirement because the requirement to file the report with the other annual reports
required under Rule 17g-3 is pursuant to section 15E(j)(5)(B) of the Exchange Act. 2455
Moreover, the Commission is not adding any requirements with respect to the filing other than
the requirement that this report be filed with the other annual reports. However, as discussed in
more detail below, this report and the other annual reports must be submitted through the
EDGAR system. 2456
The Commission is amending Rule 17g-5. First, the Commission is adding paragraph
(a)(3)(iii)(E) to Rule 17g-5 to require an NRSRO to obtain an additional representation from the
issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of an asset-backed security that the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter
will post on the Rule 17g-5 website, promptly after receipt, any executed Form ABS Due
Diligence-15E delivered by a person employed to provide third-party due diligence services with
respect to the security or money market instrument. 2457
Second, the Commission is adding paragraph (c)(8) to Rule 17g-5 to prohibit an NRSRO
from issuing or maintaining a credit rating where a person within the NRSRO who participates in
determining or monitoring the credit rating, or developing or approving procedures or
methodologies used for determining the credit rating, including qualitative and quantitative
models, also: (1) participates in sales or marketing of a product or service of the NRSRO or a

product or service of an affiliate of the NRSRO; or (2) is influenced by sales or marketing
considerations. 2458
Third, the Commission is adding paragraph (f) of Rule 17g-5, which provides that upon
written application by an NRSRO the Commission may exempt, either conditionally or
unconditionally, the NRSRO from paragraph (c)(8) if the Commission finds that due to the small
size of the NRSRO it is not appropriate to require the separation within the NRSRO of the
production of credit ratings from sales and marketing activities and such exemption is in the
public interest. 2459
Fourth, the Commission is adding paragraph (g) of Rule 17g-5 to establish a finding that
must be made in the context of a proceeding under section 15E(d)(1) of the Exchange Act that is
in lieu of the findings specified in sections 15E(d)(1)(A) through (F) of the Exchange Act. 2460
The Commission is amending Rule 17g-7. First, the Commission is incorporating the
disclosure requirement in Rule 17g-7 relating to representations, warranties, and enforcement
mechanisms available to investors in asset-backed securities before today’s amendments into
paragraph (a) of the rule and is adding disclosure provisions that require an NRSRO, when
taking certain rating actions, to publish a form containing information about the credit rating
resulting from or subject to the rating action as well as any certification of a provider of thirdparty due diligence services received by the NRSRO that relates to the credit rating. 2461 The
amendments prescribe: (1) the types of rating actions that trigger the requirement to publish the
form and, if applicable, any due diligence certifications; 2462 (2) the format of the form; 2463 (3) the

2462

The Commission is adopting an exemption for certain non-U.S rating actions from the requirements of

636

content of the form (which must include certain qualitative and quantitative information relating
to the credit rating); 2464 and (4) an attestation requirement for the form. 2465
Second, the Commission is re-codifying in paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-7 the requirements
to disclose rating histories that were contained in paragraph (d)(3) of Rule 17g-2 before today’s
amendments (the 100% Rule). 2466 The amendments to Rule 17g-7 also expand the scope of the
credit ratings that must be included in the histories and add additional data elements that must be
disclosed in the rating history for a particular credit rating.
The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-8, which requires an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document certain types of policies and procedures or to address certain
matters in policies and procedures the NRSRO is required to establish, maintain, and enforce
pursuant to the Exchange Act.
Specifically, paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to establish, maintain,
enforce, and document policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and
methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and models, the NRSRO uses to
determine credit ratings. 2467 The required policies and procedures include policies and
procedures relating to: (1) board approval of the procedures and methodologies for determining
credit ratings; 2468 (2) the development and modification of the procedures and methodologies for

paragraph (a). See section II.G.1. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of these
amendments).

See section II.G.4. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of these amendments).

2466

See section II.E.3. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of these amendments). The
Commission is also repealing paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 17g-2 (the 10% Rule). As stated above in section
II.E.3. of this release, in light of the amendments to the instructions for Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO and the
amendments to the 100% Rule, retaining the 10% Rule would provide little, if any, incremental benefit.

methodologies for determining credit ratings; 2470 (4) publishing material changes to and notices
of significant errors in the procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings; 2471 and
(5) disclosing the version of a credit rating procedure or methodology used with respect to a
particular credit rating. 2472
Paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to have policies and procedures with
respect to the symbols, numbers, or scores it uses to denote credit ratings. 2473 The required
policies and procedures include policies and procedures relating to: (1) assessing the probability
that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will default, fail to make timely
payments, or otherwise not make payments in accordance with the terms of the security or
money market instrument; 2474 (2) clearly defining each symbol, number, or score in the rating
scale used by the NRSRO and including the definitions in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO; 2475 and (3)
applying any symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the NRSRO in a manner that is
consistent for all types of obligors, securities, and money market instruments for which the
symbol, number, or score is used. 2476
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-8 requires that the policies and procedures an NRSRO is
required to establish, maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Exchange
Act with respect to look-back reviews must address instances in which a look-back review

procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the NRSRO takes certain steps reasonably
designed to ensure the credit rating is no longer influenced by the conflict and that the existence
and an explanation of the conflict is disclosed. 2477
Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-8 requires an NRSRO to consider certain prescribed factors
when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal structure
governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and methodologies for
determining credit ratings pursuant to section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act. 2478
The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-9. Rule 17g-9 requires an NRSRO to establish,
maintain, enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for the
individuals it employs to participate in the determination of credit ratings that are reasonably
designed to achieve the objective that the NRSRO produce accurate credit ratings in the classes
of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is registered. 2479 Paragraph (b) identifies four factors the
NRSRO must consider when designing the standards. 2480 Paragraph (c)(1) requires NRSROs to
include a requirement for periodic testing in its standards. 2481 Paragraph (c)(2) provides that the
standards must include a requirement that at least one individual with an “appropriate level of
experience in performing credit analysis, but not less than three years” must participate in the
determination of a credit rating. 2482

The Commission is adopting Rule 17g-10 and Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2483
Paragraph (a) of Rule 17g-10 provides that the written certification providers of third-party due
diligence services must provide to NRSROs pursuant to section 15E(s)(4)(B) of the Exchange
Act must be made on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E. 2484 Paragraph (b) of Rule 17g-10 provides
that the written certification must be signed by an individual who is duly authorized by the
person providing the third-party due diligence services to make such a certification. 2485
Paragraph (c) of Rule 17g-10 provides a “safe harbor” for a provider of third-party due diligence
services to meet its obligation under section 15E(s)(4)(B). 2486 Paragraph (d) of Rule 17g-10
contains four definitions to be used for the purposes of section 15E(s)(4)(B) and Rule 17g-10;
namely, definitions of due diligence services, 2487 issuer, 2488 originator, 2489 and securitizer. 2490
Form ABS Due Diligence-15E contains five line items identifying information the
provider of third-party due diligence services must provide. 2491 It also contains a signature line
with a corresponding representation. 2492 Item 1 elicits the identity and address of the provider of
third-party due diligence services. 2493 Item 2 elicits the identity and address of the issuer,

provider of the due diligence services to identify each NRSRO whose published criteria for
performing due diligence the provider of third-party due diligence services intended to satisfy in
performing the due diligence review. 2495 Item 4 requires the provider of third-party due
diligence services to describe the scope and manner of the due diligence performed. 2496 Item 5
requires the provider of third-party due diligence services to describe the findings and
conclusions resulting from the review. 2497
The Commission is adopting Rule 15Ga-2 and amendments to Form ABS-15G. 2498 Rule
15Ga-2 requires an issuer or underwriter of certain Exchange Act-ABS that are to be rated by an
NRSRO to furnish a Form ABS-15G on the Commission’s EDGAR system containing the
findings and conclusions of any third-party “due diligence report” obtained by the issuer or
underwriter at least five business days prior to the first sale in the offering. The rule defines due
diligence report as any report containing findings and conclusions relating to due diligence
services as defined in Rule 17g-10. 2499 Under the rule, the disclosure must be furnished using
Form ABS-15G for both registered and unregistered offerings of Exchange Act-ABS. However,
if the disclosure required by Rule 15Ga-2 has been made in the applicable prospectus, the issuer
or underwriter may refer to that section of the prospectus in Form ABS-15G rather than
providing the findings and conclusions directly on the form. 2500 Also, Rule 15Ga-2 provides an
exemption for certain offshore issuances of Exchange Act-ABS. Further, the final rule does not

an issuer or underwriter of these securities to make publicly available the findings and
conclusions of any third-party due diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter.
As stated above, the Commission is requiring that certain Forms NRSRO and all Rule
17g-3 annual reports be submitted to the Commission electronically using the Commission’s
EDGAR system as PDF documents. 2501 In order to implement this requirement, the Commission
is adopting amendments to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T to require that Forms NRSRO and
Exhibits 1 through 9 submitted pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of Rule 17g-1 and the
annual reports submitted pursuant Rule 17g-3 be submitted through the EDGAR system as PDF
documents. 2502
NRSROs will need to file a Form ID with the Commission in order to gain access to the
Commission’s EDGAR system to make electronic submissions to the Commission.2503
Issuers and underwriters of Exchange Act-ABS also will need to furnish Form ABS-15G
to the Commission through the EDGAR system pursuant to Rule 15Ga-2. The Commission
believes that these issuers and underwriters already have access to the EDGAR system because,
for example, they need such access for purposes of Rule 15Ga-1. Consequently, the new rule
and amendments will not require them to file a Form ID to gain access to the EDGAR system.
E.

AGENCY ACTION TO MINIMIZE EFFECT ON SMALL ENTITIES

Pursuant to section 604(a)(6) of the RFA, the Commission must describe the steps it has
taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the stated

2501

See section II.L. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this amendment).

2502

See paragraph (a)(xiv) of Rule 101 of Regulation S-T.

2503

See section II.L. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of these requirements).

642

objectives of applicable statutes. 2504 In connection with adopting the amendments and new rules,
the Commission considered the following alternatives: (1) the establishment of differing
compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available
to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and
reporting requirements under the rules for small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than
design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rules, or any part of the rules, for
small entities.
As discussed throughout this release, as well as in section VI.B. of this release, the
Commission is sensitive to the costs and burdens the amendments and new rules will have on all
entities, including small entities. Consequently, the amendments and new rules contain certain
modifications from the proposals designed to alleviate as appropriate some of the concerns
regarding small entities. The Commission believes that the amendments and new rules being
adopted today, as modified from the proposal, strike an appropriate balance between minimizing
the costs and burdens on small entities, and implementing the policies and requirements
addressed by Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act. Moreover, the Commission believes
the choices it has made in implementing Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank Act have
resulted in amendments and new rules that are appropriate for entities of all sizes.
Consistent with Exchange Act section 15E(h)(3)(B)(i), the Commission has provided for
a process for small NRSROs to seek exemptions with respect to the sales and marketing conflict
of interest provisions. 2505 The Commission does not otherwise believe it is appropriate to
establish different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables; to clarify, consolidate, or
simplify compliance and reporting requirements under the amendments to existing rules and new
2504

See 5 U.S.C. 604(a)(6).

2505

See section II.B.2. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of this provision).

643

rules for small entities; or summarily exempt small entities from coverage of the rules, or any
part of the rules. As discussed throughout this release, the amendments and new rules being
adopted today are designed to improve the governance of NRSROs with respect to their
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings, increase the transparency of
NRSRO activities, and improve the quality of NRSRO credit ratings. These measures will
benefit NRSROs, investors, and other users of credit ratings. Moreover, the objectives of
governance, transparency, and quality are as relevant to small NRSROs as they are to large
NRSROs insomuch as investors and others use the credit ratings of all NRSROs.
However, where possible in the adopted amendments and new rules and as discussed
throughout this release, the Commission has used performance standards. Policies and
procedures requirements allow for tailoring by the small NRSROs to their particular business
models. As noted in section VI.B. of this release, a number of the amendments and new rules are
policies and procedures-based requirements and, consequently, a small NRSRO can comply with
these requirements by tailoring and scaling its policies and procedures to its size and business
activities. For example, the Commission has established policies and procedures-based
requirements in Rule 17g-8 to implement provisions in Title IX, Subtitle C of the Dodd-Frank
Act that address: (1) the procedures and methodologies an NRSRO uses to determine credit
ratings; 2506 (2) the symbols, numbers, or scores an NRSRO uses to denote credit ratings; 2507 and
(3) look-back reviews. 2508 In addition, the new rule requiring an NRSRO to establish, maintain,
enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for the individuals it

644

employs to participate in the determination of credit ratings provides the NRSRO with flexibility
to design the standards subject to certain minimum requirements. 2509
Moreover, as noted in section VI.B. of this release, the Commission has modified the
amendments and new rules from the proposal in ways that will reduce costs on, and burdens for,
all NRSROs subject to the amendments and new rules, including small entities. For example, the
Commission has modified the provisions from the proposal regarding the disclosure of
performance statistics to narrow the scope of the credit ratings included in the statistics, which
will make producing them less costly and burdensome. 2510 In addition, the Commission has
significantly shortened from the proposal the time horizon of historical information that must be
retrieved for inclusion in the rating histories. 2511 Furthermore, the Commission has narrowed
from the proposal the scope of rating actions that will trigger the requirement that an NRSRO
publish a form and any due diligence certifications when taking a rating action and has exempted
from this requirement certain rating actions involving credit ratings assigned to foreign obligors
or securities or money market instruments issued overseas. 2512 These modifications and the
other modifications discussed throughout this release, as well as in section VI.B. of this release,
will reduce the cumulative cost and burden of the amendments and new rules as compared with
the proposals.
Finally, the amendments and new rules being adopted today will make additional
information about third-party due diligence services provided for Exchange Act-ABS available
to market participants and others. 2513 This will benefit NRSROs, the users of credit ratings, and

2513

See section II.H. of this release (providing a more detailed discussion of the final amendments and new

645

investors and other Exchange Act-ABS market participants who may or may not be users of
credit ratings. 2514 As discussed in section VI.C. of this release, the Commission estimates that all
fifteen providers of third-party due diligence services subject to the new requirements are small
entities and that the new requirements applicable to issuers will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
As noted above, the Commission included its view that the requirements applicable to
issuers will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in
the proposing release and received no comments on its conclusion and the Commission estimates
that only one of the estimated 336 unique issuers is small for purposes of the PRA. For these
reasons, the Commission does not believe it is appropriate to establish different compliance or
reporting requirements or timetables; to clarify, consolidate, or simplify compliance and
reporting requirements under the amendments to existing rules and new rules for small entities;
or summarily exempt small entities from coverage of the rules, or any part of the rules.

Section 240.15Ga-2 is added to read as follows:

§ 240.15Ga-2 Findings and conclusions of third-party due diligence reports.
(a) The issuer or underwriter of an offering of any asset-backed security (as that term is
defined in Section 3(a)(79) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(79))) that is to be rated by a nationally
recognized statistical rating organization must furnish Form ABS-15G (§ 249.1400 of this
chapter) to the Commission containing the findings and conclusions of any third-party due

648

diligence report obtained by the issuer or underwriter at least five business days prior to the first
sale in the offering.
Instruction to paragraph (a): Disclosure of the findings and conclusions includes, but is
not limited to, disclosure of the criteria against which the loans were evaluated, and how the
evaluated loans compared to those criteria along with the basis for including any loans not
meeting those criteria. This disclosure is only required for an initial rating and does not need to
be furnished in connection with any subsequent rating actions. For purposes of this rule, the date
of first sale is the date on which the first investor is irrevocably contractually committed to
invest, which, depending on the terms and conditions of the contract, could be the date on which
the issuer receives the investor’s subscription agreement or check.
(b) In the case where the issuer and one or more underwriters have obtained the same
third-party due diligence report related to a particular asset-backed securities transaction, if any
one such party has furnished all the disclosures required in order to meet the obligations under
paragraph (a) of this section, the other party or parties are not required to separately furnish the
same disclosures related to such third-party due diligence report.
(c) If the disclosure required by this rule has been made in the prospectus (including an
attribution to the third-party that provided the third-party due diligence report), the issuer or
underwriter may refer to that section of the prospectus in Form ABS-15G rather than providing
the findings and conclusions itself directly in Form ABS-15G.
(d) For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, issuer is defined in Rule 17g10(d)(2) (§ 240.17g-10(d)(2) of this chapter) and third-party due diligence report means any
report containing findings and conclusions of any due diligence services as defined in Rule 17g10(d)(1) (§ 240.17g-10(d)(1) of this chapter) performed by a third party.

649

(e) The requirements of this rule would not apply to an offering of an asset-backed
security if certain conditions are met, including:
(i) The offering is not required to be, and is not, registered under the Securities Act of
1933;
(ii) The issuer of the rated security is not a U.S. person (as defined under Securities Act
Rule 902(k)); and
(iii) the security issued by the issuer will be offered and sold upon issuance, and any
underwriter or arranger linked to the security will effect transactions of the security after
issuance, only in transactions that occur outside the United States.
(f) The requirements of this rule would not apply to an offering of an asset-backed
security if certain conditions are met, including:
(i) The issuer of the rated security is a municipal issuer; and

Section 240.17g-8 is added to read as follows:

673

§ 240.17g-8 Policies, procedures, and internal controls.
(a) Policies and procedures with respect to the procedures and methodologies used to
determine credit ratings. A nationally recognized statistical rating organization must establish,
maintain, enforce, and document policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure:
(1) That the procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data
and models, the nationally recognized statistical rating organization uses to determine credit
ratings are approved by its board of directors or a body performing a function similar to that of a
board of directors.
(2) That the procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data
and models, the nationally recognized statistical rating organization uses to determine credit
ratings are developed and modified in accordance with the policies and procedures of the
nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
(3) That material changes to the procedures and methodologies, including changes to
qualitative and quantitative data and models, the nationally recognized statistical rating
organization uses to determine credit ratings are:
(i) Applied consistently to all current and future credit ratings to which the changed
procedures or methodologies apply; and
(ii) To the extent that the changes are to surveillance or monitoring procedures and
methodologies, applied to current credit ratings to which the changed procedures or
methodologies apply within a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the number of
credit ratings impacted, the complexity of the procedures and methodologies used to determine
the credit ratings, and the type of obligor, security, or money market instrument being rated.

674

(4) That the nationally recognized statistical rating organization promptly publishes on an
easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website:
(i) Material changes to the procedures and methodologies, including to qualitative models
or quantitative inputs, the nationally recognized statistical rating organization uses to determine
credit ratings, the reason for the changes, and the likelihood the changes will result in changes to
any current credit ratings; and
(ii) Notice of the existence of a significant error identified in a procedure or
methodology, including a qualitative or quantitative model, the nationally recognized statistical
rating organization uses to determine credit ratings that may result in a change to current credit
ratings.
(5) That the nationally recognized statistical rating organization discloses the version of a
credit rating procedure or methodology, including the qualitative methodology or quantitative
inputs, used with respect to a particular credit rating.
(b) Policies and procedures with respect to credit rating symbols, numbers, or scores. A
nationally recognized statistical rating organization must establish, maintain, enforce, and
document policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to:
(1) Assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will
default, fail to make timely payments, or otherwise not make payments to investors in
accordance with the terms of the security or money market instrument.
(2) Clearly define each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by the
nationally recognized statistical rating organization to denote a credit rating category and notches
within a category for each class of credit ratings for which the nationally recognized statistical

675

rating organization is registered (including subclasses within each class) and to include such
definitions in Exhibit 1 to Form NRSRO (§ 249b.300 of this chapter).
(3) Apply any symbol, number, or score defined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this
section in a manner that is consistent for all types of obligors, securities, and money market
instruments for which the symbol, number, or score is used.
(c) Policies and procedures with respect to look-back reviews. The policies and
procedures a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is required to establish,
maintain, and enforce pursuant to section 15E(h)(4)(A) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-7(h)(4)(A))
must address instances in which a review conducted pursuant to those policies and procedures
determines that a conflict of interest influenced a credit rating assigned to an obligor, security, or
money market instrument by including, at a minimum, procedures that are reasonably designed
to ensure that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization will:
(1) Promptly determine whether the current credit rating assigned to the obligor, security,
or money market instrument must be revised so that it no longer is influenced by a conflict of
interest and is solely a product of the documented procedures and methodologies the nationally
recognized statistical rating organization uses to determine credit ratings; and
(2)(i) Promptly publish, based on the determination of whether a current credit rating
referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be revised (as applicable):
(A) A revised credit rating, if appropriate, and include with the publication of the revised
credit rating the information required by § 240.17g-7(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(i); or
(B) An affirmation of the credit rating, if appropriate, and include with the publication of
the affirmation the information required by § 240.17g-7(a)(1)(ii)(J)(3)(ii).

676

(ii) If the credit rating is not revised or affirmed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this
section within fifteen calendar days of the date of the discovery that the credit rating was
influenced by a conflict of interest, publish a rating action placing the credit rating on watch or
review and include with the publication an explanation that the reason for the action is the
discovery that the credit rating was influenced by a conflict of interest.
(d) Internal control structures. A nationally recognized statistical rating organization
must take into consideration the factors identified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section
when establishing, maintaining, enforcing, and documenting an effective internal control
structure governing the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures, and
methodologies for determining credit ratings pursuant to section 15E(c)(3)(A) of the Act.
(1) With respect to establishing the internal control structure, the nationally recognized
statistical rating organization must take into consideration:
(i) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a newly developed methodology or
proposed update to an in-use methodology for determining credit ratings is subject to an
appropriate review process (for example, by persons who are independent from the persons that
developed the methodology or methodology update) and to management approval prior to the
new or updated methodology being employed by the nationally recognized statistical rating
organization to determine credit ratings;
(ii) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a newly developed methodology or
update to an in-use methodology for determining credit ratings is disclosed to the public for
consultation prior to the new or updated methodology being employed by the nationally
recognized statistical rating organization to determine credit ratings, that the nationally
recognized statistical rating organization makes comments received as part of the consultation

677

publicly available, and that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization considers the
comments before implementing the methodology;
(iii) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that in-use methodologies for determining
credit ratings are periodically reviewed (for example, by persons who are independent from the
persons who developed and/or use the methodology) in order to analyze whether the
methodology should be updated;
(iv) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that market participants have an opportunity
to provide comment on whether in-use methodologies for determining credit ratings should be
updated, that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization makes any such comments
received publicly available, and that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization
considers the comments;
(v) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that newly developed or updated quantitative
models proposed to be incorporated into a credit rating methodology are evaluated and validated
prior to being put into use;
(vi) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that quantitative models incorporated into inuse credit rating methodologies are periodically reviewed and back-tested;
(vii) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization engages in analysis before commencing the rating of a class of obligors, securities,
or money market instruments the nationally recognized statistical rating organization has not
previously rated to determine whether the nationally recognized statistical rating organization
has sufficient competency, access to necessary information, and resources to rate the type of
obligor, security, or money market instrument;

678

(viii) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization engages in analysis before commencing the rating of an “exotic” or
“bespoke” type of obligor, security, or money market instrument to review the feasibility of
determining a credit rating;
(ix) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that measures (for example, statistics) are
used to evaluate the performance of credit ratings as part of the review of in-use methodologies
for determining credit ratings to analyze whether the methodologies should be updated or the
work of the analysts employing the methodologies should be reviewed;
(x) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that, with respect to determining credit
ratings, the work and conclusions of the lead credit analyst developing an initial credit rating or
conducting surveillance on an existing credit rating is reviewed by other analysts, supervisors, or
senior managers before a rating action is formally taken (for example, having the work reviewed
through a rating committee process);
(xi) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that a credit analyst documents the steps
taken in developing an initial credit rating or conducting surveillance on an existing credit rating
with sufficient detail to permit an after-the-fact review or internal audit of the rating file to
analyze whether the analyst adhered to the nationally recognized statistical rating organization’s
procedures and methodologies for determining credit ratings;
(xii) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that the nationally recognized statistical
rating organization conducts periodic reviews or internal audits of rating files to analyze whether
analysts adhere to the nationally recognized statistical rating organization’s procedures and
methodologies for determining credit ratings; and

679

(xiii) Any other controls necessary to establish an effective internal control structure
taking into consideration the nature of the business of the nationally recognized statistical rating
organization, including its size, activities, organizational structure, and business model.
(2) With respect to maintaining the internal control structure, the nationally recognized
statistical rating organization must take into consideration:
(i) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that the nationally recognized statistical rating
organization conducts periodic reviews of whether it has devoted sufficient resources to
implement and operate the documented internal control structure as designed;
(ii) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that the nationally recognized statistical
rating organization conducts periodic reviews or ongoing monitoring to evaluate the
effectiveness of the internal control structure and whether it should be updated;
(iii) Controls reasonably designed to ensure that any identified deficiencies in the internal
control structure are assessed and addressed on a timely basis;
(iv) Any other controls necessary to maintain an effective internal control structure taking
into consideration the nature of the business of the nationally recognized statistical rating
organization, including its size, activities, organizational structure, and business model.
(3) With respect to enforcing the internal control structure, the nationally recognized
statistical rating organization must take into consideration:
(i) Controls designed to ensure that additional training is provided or discipline taken
with respect to employees who fail to adhere to requirements imposed by the internal control
structure;
(ii) Controls designed to ensure that a process is in place for employees to report failures
to adhere to the internal control structure; and

680

(iii) Any other controls necessary to enforce an effective internal control structure taking
into consideration the nature of the business of the nationally recognized statistical rating
organization, including its size, activities, organizational structure, and business model.
(4) With respect to documenting the internal control structure, the nationally recognized
statistical rating organization must take into consideration any controls necessary to document an
effective internal control structure taking into consideration the nature of the business of the
nationally recognized statistical rating organization, including its size, activities, organizational
structure, and business model.
12.

Section 240.17g-9 is added to read as follows:

§ 240.17g-9 Standards of training, experience, and competence for credit analysts.
(a) A nationally recognized statistical rating organization must establish, maintain,
enforce, and document standards of training, experience, and competence for the individuals it
employs to participate in the determination of credit ratings that are reasonably designed to
achieve the objective that the nationally recognized statistical rating organization produces
accurate credit ratings in the classes of credit ratings for which the nationally recognized
statistical rating organization is registered.
(b) The nationally recognized statistical rating organization must consider the following
when establishing the standards required under paragraph (a) of this section:

qualitative analysis, the knowledge necessary to effectively evaluate and process the data
relevant to the creditworthiness of the obligor being rated or the issuer of the securities or money
market instruments being rated;

681

(2) If the credit rating procedures and methodologies used by the individual involve
quantitative analysis, the technical expertise necessary to understand any models and model
inputs that are a part of the procedures and methodologies;
(3) The classes and subclasses of credit ratings for which the individual participates in
determining credit ratings and the factors relevant to such classes and subclasses, including the
geographic location, sector, industry, regulatory and legal framework, and underlying assets,
applicable to the obligors or issuers in the classes and subclasses; and
(4) The complexity of the obligors, securities, or money market instruments for which
the individual participates in determining credit ratings.
(c) The nationally recognized statistical rating organization must include the following in
the standards required under paragraph (a) of this section:

FORM NRSRO INSTRUCTIONS
696

A.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.

1.

Form NRSRO is the Application for Registration as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organization (“NRSRO”) under Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) and Exchange Act Rule 17g-1. Exchange Act Rule 17g-1 requires an Applicant/NRSRO to
use Form NRSRO to:
•

File an initial application to be registered as an NRSRO with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“Commission”);

•

File an application to register for an additional class of credit ratings with the
Commission;

•

File an application supplement with the Commission;

•

File an update of registration pursuant to Section 15E(b)(1) of the Exchange Act with the
Commission;

•

File an annual certification pursuant to Section 15E(b)(2) of the Exchange Act with the
Commission; and

•

Furnish a withdrawal of registration pursuant to Section 15E(e) of the Exchange Act to
the Commission.

2.

Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(c) requires that an Applicant/NRSRO promptly file with the Commission
a written notice if information filed with the Commission in an initial application for registration or
in an application to register for an additional class of credit ratings is found to be or becomes
materially inaccurate before the Commission has granted or denied the application. The notice
must identify the information found to be materially inaccurate. The Applicant/NRSRO must also
promptly file with the Commission accurate and complete information as an application
supplement on Form NRSRO.

3.

Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i), an NRSRO must make its current Form NRSRO and
information and documents filed in Exhibits 1 through 9 to Form NRSRO publicly and freely
available on an easily accessible portion of its corporate Internet website within 10 business days
after the date of the Commission Order granting an initial application for registration as an

697

NRSRO or an application to register for an additional class of credit ratings and within 10
business days after filing with or furnishing to, as applicable, the Commission an update of
registration, annual certification, or withdrawal from registration on Form NRSRO.
The certifications from qualified institutional buyers, disclosure reporting pages, and Exhibits 10
through 13 are not required to be made publicly available by the NRSRO pursuant to Rule
17g-1(i). An Applicant/NRSRO may request that the Commission keep confidential the
certifications from qualified institutional buyers, the disclosure reporting pages, and the
information and documents in Exhibits 10 – 13 filed with the Commission. An Applicant/NRSRO
seeking confidential treatment for these submissions should mark each page “Confidential
Treatment” and comply with Commission rules governing confidential treatment (See 17 CFR
200.80 and 17 CFR 200.83). The Commission will keep this information confidential to the extent
permitted by law.
4.

Section 15E(a)(2) of the Exchange Act prescribes time periods and requirements for the
Commission to grant or deny an initial application for registration as an NRSRO. These time
periods also apply to an application to register for an additional class of credit ratings.

5.

Type or clearly print all information. Use only the current version of Form NRSRO or a
reproduction of it.

6.

Section 15E of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-7) authorizes the Commission to collect the
Information on Form NRSRO from an Applicant/NRSRO. The principal purposes of Form
NRSRO are to determine whether an Applicant should be granted registration as an NRSRO,
whether an NRSRO should be granted registration in an additional class of credit ratings, whether
an NRSRO continues to meet the criteria for registration as an NRSRO, for an NRSRO to
withdraw from registration, and to provide information about an NRSRO to users of credit ratings.
Intentional misstatements or omissions may constitute federal criminal violations under 18 U.S.C.
1001.
The information collection is in accordance with the clearance requirements of Section 3507 of
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507). The Commission may not conduct or
sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a

698

valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The time required to complete
and file or furnish, as applicable, this form, will vary depending on individual circumstances. The
estimated average time to complete an initial application is displayed on the facing page of this
Form. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or suggestions for reducing the burden to
Chief Information Officer, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington,
DC 20549 or PRA Mailbox@sec.gov.
7.

Under Exchange Act Rule 17g-2(b)(10), an NRSRO must retain copies of all Forms NRSRO
(including Exhibits, accompanying information, and documents) filed with or furnished to, as
applicable, the Commission. Exchange Act Rule 17g-2(c) requires that these records be retained
for three years after the date the record is made.

8.

An Applicant must file with the Commission at the address indicated below two paper copies of
an initial application for registration as an NRSRO under Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(a), an
application to register for an additional class of credit ratings under Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(b),
a supplement to an initial application or application to register for an additional class of credit
ratings under Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(c), or a withdrawal of an initial application or an
application to register for an additional class of credit ratings under Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(d).
ADDRESS -

The mailing address for Form NRSRO is:
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

699

all applicable instructions for the Form, including the instructions in Item A.8 with respect to how a
Form NRSRO must be filed with or furnished to the Commission.

Item 4. Section 15E(j)(1) of the Exchange Act requires an NRSRO to designate a compliance officer
responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the NRSRO established pursuant to sections
15E(g) and (h) of the Exchange Act (respectively, to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information
and address and manage conflicts of interest) and for ensuring compliance with applicable securities
laws, rules, and regulations.
Item 5. Section 15E(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i) require an NRSRO to
make Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 – 9 to Form NRSRO filed with the Commission publicly and freely
available on an easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s corporate Internet website within 10 business
days after the date of the Commission order granting an initial application for registration as an NRSRO
or an application to register for an additional class of credit ratings and within 10 business days after filing
with or furnishing to, as applicable, the Commission an amendment, annual certification, or withdrawal
from registration on Form NRSRO. The certifications from qualified institutional investors, Disclosure
Reporting Pages, and Exhibits 10 through 13 are not required to be made publicly available on the
NRSRO’s corporate Internet website. Describe how the current Form NRSRO and Exhibits 1 – 9 will be
made publicly and freely available on an easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s corporate Internet
website by providing the Internet address and link to the Form and Exhibits.
Item 6. Complete Item 6 only if filing an initial application for registration, an application to be registered
in an additional class of credit ratings, or an application supplement.
Item 6A. Pursuant to section 15E(a)(1)(B)(vii) of the Exchange Act, an Applicant applying for registration
as an NRSRO must disclose in the application the classes of credit ratings for which the
Applicant/NRSRO is applying to be registered. Indicate these classes by checking the appropriate box or
boxes. For each class of credit ratings, provide in the appropriate box the approximate number of
obligors, securities, and money market instruments in that class for which the Applicant/NRSRO presently
has a credit rating outstanding as of the date of the application. In determining this amount, the
Applicant/NRSRO must treat as a separately rated security or money market instrument each individually
rated security and money market instrument that, for example, is assigned a distinct CUSIP or other

705

unique identifier, has distinct credit enhancement features as compared with other securities or money
market instruments of the same issuer, or has a different maturity date as compared with other securities
or money market instruments of the same issuer. The Applicant/NRSRO must not include an obligor,
security, or money market instrument in more than one class of credit rating. An Applicant/NRSRO must
include in the class of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv) of the Exchange Act (issuers of
asset-backed securities) to the extent not described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv), any rated security or money
market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed securities transaction. For
each class of credit ratings, also provide in the appropriate box the approximate date the
Applicant/NRSRO began issuing and making readily accessible credit ratings in the class on a continuous
basis through the present as a “credit rating agency,” as that term is defined in section 3(a)(61) of the
Exchange Act. If there was a period when the Applicant/NRSRO stopped issuing credit ratings in a
particular class or stopped operating as a credit rating agency, provide the approximate date the
Applicant/NRSRO resumed issuing and making readily accessible credit ratings in that class as a credit
rating agency. Refer to the definition of “credit rating agency” in the instructions below (also at 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(61)) to determine when the Applicant/NRSRO began operating as a “credit rating agency.”
Item 6B. To meet the definition of “credit rating agency” pursuant to section 3(a)(61)(A) of the Exchange
Act, the Applicant must, among other things, issue “credit ratings on the Internet or through another
readily accessible means, for free or for a reasonable fee.” Briefly describe how the Applicant/NRSRO
makes the credit ratings in the classes indicated in Item 6A readily accessible for free or for a reasonable
fee. If a person must pay a fee to obtain a credit rating made readily accessible by the Applicant/NRSRO,
provide a fee schedule or describe the price(s) charged.
Item 6C. If the Applicant/NRSRO is required to file qualified institutional buyer certifications under section
15E(a)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act file a minimum of 10 certifications from qualified institutional buyers,
none of which is affiliated with the Applicant/NRSRO. Each certification may address more than one
class of credit ratings. To be registered as an NRSRO for a class of credit ratings identified in Item 6A
under “Applying for Registration,” the Applicant/NRSRO must file at least two certifications that address
the class of credit ratings. If this is an application of an NRSRO to be registered in one or more additional
classes of credit ratings, file at least two certifications that address each additional class of credit ratings.

706

The required certifications must be signed by a person duly authorized by the certifying entity, must be
notarized, must be marked “Certification from Qualified Institutional Buyer,” and must be in substantially
the following form:
“I, [Executing official], am authorized by [Certifying entity] to execute this certification on behalf of
[Certifying entity]. I certify that all actions by stockholders, directors, general partners, and other
bodies necessary to authorize me to execute this certification have been taken and that [Certifying

You are not required to make a Certification from a Qualified Institutional Buyer filed with this Form
NRSRO publicly available on your corporate Internet website pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i).
You may request that the Commission keep these certifications confidential by marking each page
“Confidential Treatment” and complying with Commission rules governing confidential treatment (See 17
CFR 200.80 and 17 CFR 200.83). The Commission will keep the certifications confidential upon request
to the extent permitted by law.
Item 7. An Applicant filing Form NRSRO to apply for registration as an NRSRO should not complete Item
7. An NRSRO filing or furnishing, as applicable, Form NRSRO for any other reason must complete Item
7. The information in Item 7 must be updated on an annual basis with the filing of the annual certification.

707

Item 7A. Indicate the classes of credit ratings for which the NRSRO is currently registered by checking
the appropriate box or boxes. For each class of credit ratings, provide in the appropriate box the
approximate number of obligors, securities, and money market instruments in that class for which the
NRSRO had a credit rating outstanding as of the end of the most recently ended calendar year. In
determining this amount, NRSRO must treat as a separately rated security or money market instrument
each individually rated security and money market instrument that, for example, is assigned a distinct
CUSIP or other unique identifier, has distinct credit enhancement features as compared with other
securities or money market instruments of the same issuer, or has a different maturity date as compared
with other securities or money market instruments of the same issuer. The NRSRO must not include an
obligor, security, or money market instrument in more than one class of credit rating. An NRSRO must
include in the class of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv) of the Exchange Act (issuers of
asset-backed securities) to the extent not described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv), any rated security or money
market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed securities transaction. For
each class of credit ratings, also provide in the appropriate box the approximate date the NRSRO began
issuing and making readily accessible credit ratings in the class on a continuous basis through the
present as a “credit rating agency,” as that term is defined in section 3(a)(61) of the Exchange Act. If
there was a period when the NRSRO stopped issuing credit ratings in a particular class or stopped
operating as a credit rating agency, provide the approximate date the NRSRO resumed issuing and
making readily accessible credit ratings in that class as a credit rating agency. Refer to the definition of
“credit rating agency” in the instructions below (also at 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(61)) to determine when the
NRSRO began operating as a “credit rating agency.”
Item 7B. Briefly describe how the NRSRO makes the credit ratings in the classes indicated in Item 7A
readily accessible for free or for a reasonable fee. If a person must pay a fee to obtain a credit rating
made readily accessible by the NRSRO, provide a fee schedule or describe the price(s) charged.
Item 8. Answer each question by checking the appropriate box. Refer to the definition of “person within
an Applicant/NRSRO” set forth below to determine the persons to which the questions apply. Information
that relates to an affirmative answer must be provided on a Disclosure Reporting Page (NRSRO) and
filed with Form NRSRO. Submit a separate Disclosure Reporting Page (NRSRO) for each person that:

708

(a) has committed or omitted any act, or has been subject to an order or finding, enumerated in
subparagraphs (A), (D), (E), (G), or (H) of section 15(b)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, has
been convicted of any offense specified in section 15(b)(4)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or
has been enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in section 15(b)(4)(C) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934; (b) has been convicted of any crime that is punishable by imprisonment for 1 or
more years, and that is not described in section 15(b)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or has
been convicted of a substantially equivalent crime by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) is
subject to any order of the Commission barring or suspending the right of the person to be associated
with an NRSRO. The Disclosure Reporting Page (NRSRO) is attached to these instructions. Note: the
definition of “person within an Applicant/NRSRO” is narrower than the definition of “person associated
with a nationally recognized statistical rating organization” in Section 3(a)(63) of the Exchange Act.
You are not required to make any disclosure reporting pages submitted with this Form NRSRO publicly
available on your corporate Internet website pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i). You may request
that the Commission keep any disclosure reporting pages confidential by marking each page
“Confidential Treatment” and complying with Commission rules governing confidential treatment. The
Commission will keep the disclosure reporting pages confidential upon request to the extent permitted by
law.
Item 9. Exhibits. Section 15E(a)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act requires a credit rating agency’s application
for registration as an NRSRO to contain certain specific information and documents and, pursuant to
section 15E(a)(1)(B)(x), any other information and documents concerning the applicant and any person
associated with the applicant that the Commission requires as necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors. If any information or document required to be included with any
Exhibit is maintained in a language other than English, file a copy of the original document and a version
of the document translated into English. Attach a certification by an authorized person that the translated
version is a true, accurate, and complete English translation of the information or document. Attach the
Exhibits to Form NRSRO in numerical order. Bind each Exhibit separately, and mark each Exhibit or
bound volume of the Exhibit with the appropriate Exhibit number. The information in the Exhibits must be
sufficiently detailed to allow for verification. The information and documents in Exhibits 1 through 9 must

709

be made publicly and freely available on an easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s corporate Internet
website pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i). The information and documents in Exhibits 10 through
13 are not required to be made publicly available on the NRSRO’s corporate Internet website pursuant to
Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i). An NRSRO may request that the Commission keep these Exhibits
confidential by marking each page of them “Confidential Treatment” and complying with Commission
rules governing confidential treatment (See 17 CFR 200.80 and 17 CFR 200.83). The Commission will
keep the information and documents in these Exhibits confidential upon request to the extent permitted by
law. (Note: After registration, Exhibits 10 through 13 are not required to be made publicly available by the
NRSRO pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i) and they should not be updated with the filing of the
annual certification. Instead, similar information must be filed with the Commission not more than 90 days
after the end of each fiscal year pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-3.)
Exhibit 1. (1) An Applicant/NRSRO must provide in this Exhibit performance measurement statistics
consisting of transition and default rates for each class (and applicable subclass of credit ratings as listed
below) for which it is seeking registration as an NRSRO or for which it is registered as an NRSRO. For
each applicable class and subclass of credit ratings, an Applicant/NRSRO must provide transition and
default rates for 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year time periods through the most recent calendar year end. The
transition and default rates for each time period must be presented together in tabular form
(“Transition/Default Matrix”). The Transition/Default Matrices must be presented on a calendar year basis
even if the Applicant/NRSRO has a fiscal year end other than December 31. Exhibit 1 must be updated
annually with the filing of the NRSRO’s Annual Certification pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(f).
Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17g-1(i), an NRSRO must make the Annual Certification publicly and
freely available on an easily accessible portion of the NRSRO’s corporate Internet website within 10
business days after the filing and must make its most recently filed Exhibit 1 freely available in writing to
any individual who requests a copy of the Exhibit. The classes and subclasses of credit ratings for which
an Applicant/NRSRO must provide Transition/Default Matrices are (as applicable):
(A) The class of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act (financial
institutions, brokers, or dealers).

710

(B) The class of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(ii) of the Exchange Act (insurance
companies);
(C) The class of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iii) of the Exchange Act (corporate
issuers);
(D) The following subclasses of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv) of the Exchange Act
(issuers of asset-backed securities) and, to the extent not described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(iv), any
security or money market instrument issued by an asset pool or as part of any asset-backed
securities transaction:
(i) Residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) (for the purposes of Exhibit 1, RMBS means
a securitization primarily of residential mortgages);
(ii) Commercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”) (for the purposes of Exhibit 1, CMBS
means a securitization primarily of commercial mortgages);
(iii) Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) (for the purposes of Exhibit 1, a CLO means a
securitization primarily of commercial loans);
(iv) Collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) (for the purposes of Exhibit 1, a CDO means a
securitization primarily of other debt instruments such as RMBS, CMBS, CLOs, CDOs, other
asset backed securities, and corporate bonds);
(v) Asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) (for the purposes of Exhibit 1, ABCP means short
term notes issued by a structure that securitizes a variety of financial assets (e.g., trade
receivables or credit card receivables), which secure the notes);
(vi) other asset-backed securities (“other ABS”) (for the purposes of Exhibit 1, other ABS means a
securitization primarily of auto loans, auto leases, floor plan financings, credit card receivables,
student loans, consumer loans, or equipment leases); and
(vii) other structured finance products (“other SFPs”) (for the purposes of Exhibit 1, other SFPs
means any structured finance product not identified in subparagraphs (i) through (vi) above -the Applicant/NRSRO must provide a description of the products in this subclass); and
(E) The following subclasses of credit ratings described in section 3(a)(62)(B)(v) of the Exchange Act
(issuers of government securities, municipal securities, or securities issued by a foreign government):

711

(i) Sovereign issuers;
(ii) U.S. public finance; and
(iii) International public finance.
(2) The Transition/Default Matrices for applicable classes and subclasses of credit ratings must be
presented in the same order that the classes and subclasses of credit ratings are identified in paragraphs
(1)(A) through (E) above. For a given class or subclass, Transition/Default Matrices must be presented in
the following order: 1-year matrix, 3-year matrix, and then 10-year matrix. If the Applicant/NRSRO has not
been determining credit ratings in the applicable class or subclass for the length of time necessary to
produce a 1-year, 3-year, and/or 10-year Transition/Default Matrix, it must explain that fact in the location
where the Transition/Default Matrix would have been presented in the Exhibit. The Applicant/NRSRO
must clearly define, after the presentation of all applicable Transition/Default Matrices, each symbol,
number, or score in the rating scale used by the Applicant/NRSRO to denote a credit rating category and
notches within a category for each class and subclass of credit ratings in any Transition/Default Matrix
presented in the Exhibit. In, addition the Applicant/NRSRO must clearly explain the conditions under
which it classifies obligors, securities, or money market instruments as being in default. Next, the
Applicant/NRSRO must provide the uniform resource locator (URL) of its corporate Internet website
where the credit rating histories required to be disclosed pursuant to 17 CFR 17g-7(b) will be located (in
the case of an Applicant) or are located (in the case of an NRSRO). Exhibit 1 must contain no
performance measurement statistics or information other than as described in, and required by, these
Instructions for Exhibit 1; except that the Applicant/NRSRO may provide after the presentation of all
required Transition/Default Matrices and other disclosures: (1) a short statement describing the required
method of calculating the performance measurement statistics in Exhibit 1 (the single cohort approach)
and any advantages or limitations to the single cohort approach the Applicant/NRSRO believes would be
appropriate to disclose; (2) a short statement that the Applicant/NRSRO has calculated and published on
an Internet website performance measurement statistics using the average cohort approach (if
applicable), a description of the differences between the single cohort approach and the average cohort
approach used to calculate the performance measurement statistics, and the Internet website URL where
the performance measurements statistics calculated using the average cohort approach are located; and

712

(3) the Internet website URLs where any other information relating to performance measurement statistics
of the Applicant/NRSRO is located.
(3) The Transition/Default Matrices must be presented using the format of the sample matrix
(“Sample Matrix”) below. The first row of a Transition/Default Matrix must contain the column headings:
“Credit Ratings as of [insert the period start date]”; “Credit Ratings as of [insert the period end date]
percent”; and “Other Outcomes During [insert the period start date and end date] (percent)”. The second
row must contain column headings that are grouped under the three top row headings. The first and
second columns in Transition/Default Matrix are for entering information about the credit ratings as of the
period start date and must be grouped under the first heading in the first row. The cells in the second row
for the first two columns must contain the headings, respectively: “Credit Rating Scale” and “Number of
Ratings Outstanding.” The applicable date is the date 1, 3, or 10 years prior to the most recent calendar
year end depending on whether the Transition/Default Matrix is for a 1-year, 3-year, or 10-year period.
The next sequence of columns are for entering information about the credit ratings as of the period end
date and must be grouped under the second heading in the first row. The cells in the second row for this
series of columns must contain, from left to right, each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used
by the Applicant/NRSRO to denote a credit rating category and notches within a category for the
applicable class or subclass of credit ratings in descending order from the highest to the lowest notch.
The Applicant/NRSRO must not include a “default” category if its rating scale has such a category. The
final three columns in the header row are for entering information about credit ratings that were classified
as in default or paid off during the period, or were withdrawn during the period for reasons other than
default or having been paid off (see explanations below). These columns must grouped under the third
heading in the top row. The cells in the header rows for these columns must have the following headings
from left to right, “Default”, “Paid Off”, and “Withdrawn (other)”. The first column of a Transition/Default
Matrix must have a separate cell containing each symbol, number, or score in the rating scale used by
the Applicant/NRSRO to denote a credit rating category and notches within a category for the applicable
class or subclass of credit ratings in descending order from the highest to the lowest notch. The
Applicant/NRSRO must not include a “default” category in the column if its rating scale has such a
category. The last cell of the first column must contain the word “Total.” The cells representing no

713

change in the credit rating as of the period end date must be highlighted. Finally, the Transition/Default
Matrix must have a title identifying the applicable class or subclass of credit ratings, the period covered,
and the start date and end date of the period.
The Transition/Default Matrix must resemble the Sample Matrix below except that the number of
credit rating symbols depicted in the cells of the first column and header row of a matrix will depend on
the number of notches in the applicable rating scale of the Applicant/NRSRO (excluding a “default”
category).

(4) An Applicant/NRSRO must complete a Transition/Default Matrix as follows:
(A) Second Column Showing Number of Ratings Outstanding as of the Period Start Date. To
determine the number of credit ratings outstanding as of the period start date (the “start-date
cohort”) for all classes of credit ratings other than the class of issuers of asset-backed securities,
the Applicant/NRSRO must: (1) identify each obligor that the Applicant/NRSRO assigned a credit
rating to as an entity where the credit rating was outstanding as of the period start date; (2)
identify each additional obligor that issued securities or money market instruments that the
Applicant/NRSRO assigned credit ratings to where the credit ratings were outstanding as of the
period start date; and (3) include in the start-date cohort only credit ratings assigned to an obligor
as an entity, or, if the obligor is not assigned a credit rating as an entity, the credit rating of the
obligor’s senior unsecured debt. All other credit ratings outstanding as of the period start date
assigned to securities or money market instruments issued by the obligor must be excluded from
the start-date cohort. For the class of issuers of asset-backed securities, the start-date cohort

714

must consist of credit ratings that the Applicant/NRSRO assigned to all securities or money
market instruments in the class where the credit ratings were outstanding as of the period start
date, excluding expected or preliminary credit ratings.
In determining the start-date cohort for all classes of credit ratings, the Applicant/NRSRO must
exclude credit ratings that the Applicant/NRSRO classified as in default as of the period start date
or that were expected or preliminary credit ratings.
The Applicant/NRSRO must next determine the number of credit ratings in the start-date cohort in
each notch in the “Credit Rating Scale” column as of the period start date and enter this number
in the appropriate cell. The Applicant/NRSRO must enter the total number of credit ratings in the
start-date cohort in the last cell of the column.
(B) Rows Representing Credit Rating Notches. Each row representing a credit rating notch must
contain percents indicating the credit rating outcomes as of the period end date of all the credit
ratings at that notch as of the period start date. The percents in a row must add up to 100%. To
compute the percents for each row in the Transition/Default Matrix representing a notch in the
rating scale:
(i) The Applicant/NRSRO must determine the number of credit ratings in the start-date cohort
at that notch as of the period start date that were assigned a credit rating at the same notch
as of the period end date. This number must be expressed as a percent of the total number
of credit ratings at that notch as of the period start date and the percent must be entered in
the column representing the same notch. The cell must be highlighted. To determine this
percent, the Applicant/NRSRO must use the credit rating as of the period end date and not a
credit rating assigned between the period start date and the period end date.
(ii) The Applicant/NRSRO must determine the number credit ratings at that notch as of the
period start date at each other notch as of the period end date. These numbers must be
expressed as percents of the total number of credit ratings at that notch as of the period start
date and the percents must be entered in the columns representing each notch. To
determine these percents, the Applicant/NRSRO must use the credit rating as of the period

715

end date and not a credit rating assigned between the period start date and the period end
date.
(iii) The Applicant/NRSRO must determine the number of credit ratings at that notch as of the
period start date that went into Default (see explanation below) at any time during the
applicable time period. This number must be expressed as a percent of the total number of
credit ratings at that notch as of the period start date and the percent must be entered in the
Default column. The Applicant/NRSRO must classify a credit rating as a Default if any of the
following conditions are met:
(a) The obligor failed to timely pay principal or interest due according to the terms of an
obligation during the applicable period or the issuer of the security or money market
instrument failed to timely pay principal or interest due according to the terms of the
security or money market instrument during the applicable period;
(b) The security or money market instrument was subject to a write-down, applied loss,
or other realized deficiency of the outstanding principal amount during the applicable
period; or
(c) The Applicant/NRSRO classified the obligor, security, or money market instrument as
having gone into default using its own definition of “default” during the applicable
period.
A credit rating that goes into in Default as defined in this paragraph (4)(B)(iii) must be
classified as in Default even if the Applicant/NRSRO assigned a credit rating to the obligor,
security, or money market instrument at a notch above default in its rating scale on or after
the event of Default or withdrew the credit rating on or after the event of Default.
(iv) The Applicant/NRSRO must determine the number of credit ratings at that notch as of the
period start date that were Paid Off (see explanation below) at any time during the applicable
time period. This number must be expressed as a percent of the total number of credit
ratings at that notch as of the period start date and the percent must be entered in the Paid
Off column. To determine this percent, the Applicant/NRSRO must classify a credit rating as
Paid Off if the issuer of the security or money market instrument assigned the credit rating

716

extinguished its obligation with respect to the security or money market instrument during the
applicable time period by paying in full all outstanding principal and interest due according to
the terms of the security or money market instrument (for example, because the security or
money market instrument matured, was called, or was prepaid); and the Applicant/NRSRO
withdrew the credit rating for the security or money market instrument because the obligation
was extinguished.
(v) The Applicant/NRSRO must determine the number of credit ratings at that notch as of the
period start date for which the Applicant/NRSRO withdrew a credit rating at any time during
the applicable time period for a reason other than Default (as described in paragraph
(4)(B)(iii)) or Paid-Off (as described in paragraph (4)(B)(iv)). This number must be expressed
as a percent of the total number of credit ratings at that notch as of the period start date and
the percent must be entered in the Withdrawn (other) column. The Applicant/NRSRO must
classify the credit rating as Withdrawn (other) even if the Applicant/NRSRO assigned a credit
rating to the obligor, security, or money market instrument after withdrawing its credit rating.
Exhibit 2. Provide in this Exhibit a general description of the procedures and methodologies used
by the Applicant/NRSRO to determine credit ratings, including unsolicited credit ratings within the
classes of credit ratings for which the Applicant/NRSRO is seeking registration or is registered. The
description must be sufficiently detailed to provide users of credit ratings with an understanding of
the processes employed by the Applicant/NRSRO in determining credit ratings, including, as
