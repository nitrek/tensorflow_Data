ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16386

In the Matter of
TRACI J. ANDERSON, CPA,
TIMOTHY W. CARNAHAN, AND
CYIOS CORPORATION

NOTICE

On December 21, 2015, I issued the initial decision (ID) in this matter. See Traci J.
Anderson, CPA, Initial Decision Release No. 930, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5189. In the ID, I noted
that a party could file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the ID, and
that if such motion to correct was filed by a party, then a party had twenty-one days to file a
petition for review of the ID from the date of the order resolving the motion to correct. Id. at
*66-67; see 17 C.F.R. § 201.410(b). On December 24, pro se Respondents Timothy W.
Carnahan and CYIOS Corporation submitted a motion to correct manifest errors of fact, and on
January 4, 2016, submitted a motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal, both of which I
denied. See Traci J. Anderson, CPA, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3472, 2016 SEC LEXIS
43 (ALJ Jan. 6, 2016). In my order denying those motions, I noted that inasmuch as the motion
for certification “[was] a petition for review of the ID, it [was] necessarily directed to the
[Securities and Exchange] Commission.” Id.
On January 11, 2016, Respondents submitted to this office a document which appears to
be a petition for review of the ID pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.410(b). The Commission’s Office
of the Secretary (OS) did not appear on the service list accompanying the document, and this
office therefore forwarded it to OS. I note that Respondents submitted the document within
twenty-one days of my order denying their motion to correct and motion for certification, and
exactly twenty-one days after the ID issued. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.410(b).
