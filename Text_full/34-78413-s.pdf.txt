Silicon Valley Executive Settles Insider Trading Charges
July 26, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a former
Silicon Valley executive has agreed to settle insider trading charges after secretly purchasing
thousands of stock shares in family members’ brokerage accounts to illegally profit on the news
of her company’s acquisition.
An SEC investigation found that Yi Chen, who was the corporate controller at Fremont, Calif.based Oplink Communications, learned confidentially that the company was in discussions to be
acquired by Koch Industries. She worked on due diligence for the acquisition and participated in
calls and meetings with Koch representatives. Despite the fact that she was working on the
acquisition and subject to a “blackout period” prohibiting her from trading in Oplink stock, Chen
attempted to circumvent the rules by trading in other family members’ accounts based on the
nonpublic information. Oplink’s stock price rose by nearly 14 percent when the companies
publicly announced the acquisition. Chen then sold all of the Oplink stock in her family
accounts for more than $34,000 in profits.
Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Chen agreed to pay $36,086.31 in
disgorgement and interest plus a $34,678.44 penalty for a total of $70,764.75. She is barred
from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and she is suspended
from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant, which includes not participating
in the financial reporting or audits of public companies. The SEC’s order permits her to apply for
reinstatement after five years.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Walker Newell and supervised by Jennifer J. Lee of
the San Francisco office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.
