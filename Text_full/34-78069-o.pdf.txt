Corporation Finance (“Corporation Finance”) sent a delinquency letter to CSDT requesting

with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 C.F.R.
Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual) (“Commission Issuer Address
Rules”). As of June 8, 2016, the common stock of ECAU was quoted on OTC Link, had five
market makers, and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c211(f)(3).

concerning the securities of Vision Industries Corp. (“VIICQ”) (CIK No. 1405424), a dissolved
Florida corporation located in Long Beach, California with a class of securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g) because it is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended June 30, 2014.On September 15, 2015, Corporation Finance sent a delinquency
letter to VIICQ requesting compliance with its periodic filing requirements but VIICQ did not
receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the
Commission as required by Commission Issuer Address Rules. As of June 8, 2016, the common
stock of VIICQ was quoted on OTC Link, had eight market makers, and was eligible for the
“piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies. Therefore, it is
ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that trading in the
