Re: File Number S7-15-16
Dear Mr. Secretary:
The purpose of this letter is to provide you with the Council of Institutional Investors’ (CII or
Council) comments on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC or Commission)
proposed rule entitled “Disclosure Update and Simplification.” 1
The Council is a nonprofit, nonpartisan association of public, corporate and union pension funds,
and other employee benefit plans, foundations and endowments with combined assets that
exceed $3 trillion. The Council also has associate (non-voting) members, including asset
management firms with more than $20 trillion in assets under management. Our member funds
are major, long-term investors committed to protecting the retirement savings of millions of
American workers. 2 The quality of disclosure regarding the public companies in which much of
that savings is invested is thus critical to our members.
CII generally supports the proposal’s objective of facilitating “the disclosure of information to
investors, while simplifying compliance efforts, without significantly altering the total mix of
information provided to investors.” 3 However, the interpretation of “significantly altering”
potentially is highly subjective.
Moreover, the devil is in the details, and we are concerned that there are a great many details in
this proposal, many of a highly technical nature, such that it can be difficult to assess reductions
in disclosure that may significantly impact the mix of information available to investors,
particularly in the limited comment period provided. We would be very concerned if this
proposal, which is put forward as technical, results in reduction in disclosure of interest to
particular investors and other users if those individuals and institutions do not have the

appropriate opportunity to fully evaluate what is being eliminated. We offer some initial
comments in this letter, but may return with further commentary as we review comment letters
and hear further from our members and the investor community more generally on particular
concerns.
Disclosure Rulemaking Priorities
Consistent with the view we expressed in our recent comment letter to the Commission in
response to the Concept Release on “Business and Financial Disclosure Required by Regulation
S-K,” 4we believe that pursuing a final rule in connection with the proposal should not be a high
priority given the SEC’s limited resources and the limited benefits the proposal is likely to
provide to investors and the capital markets generally. 5 Indeed, in its economic analysis, the SEC
seems to suggest that the proposed changes “may make the U.S. capital markets more
competitive relative to markets in other countries,” 6 but the Commission’s own IAC “is of the
view that the current degree, quality, and frequency of disclosure for U.S. issuers overall is
appropriate and a source of strength for the U.S. capital markets.” 7
We believe there are a number of other SEC disclosure-related projects are far more likely to
benefit investors and the capital markets than the proposal. Those alternative disclosure related
projects we strongly support include the following:
•

Issuance of final rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act proposals on:
o Section 953(a): Disclosure of Pay Versus Performance
o Section 954: Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation
o Section 955: Disclosure Regarding Employee and Director Hedging, 8 and

Overlapping Requirements
We generally support the Commission’s proposals in sections II.C. and II.D. that would delete or
integrate certain identified topics that are “overlapping.” 14 However, for those topics that overlap
with U.S. GAAP, we would be concerned if U.S. GAAP were to change in such a way that
useful information previously required by SEC disclosure requirements is no longer provided
under U.S. GAAP. 15
For those topics that would result in relocation of disclosures, we generally do not support
relocation of disclosures from inside to outside the financial statements. Many investors place

significant value on having required disclosures subject to “annual audit and/or interim review,
internal control over financial reporting, and XBRL tagging requirements.” 16 Many investors
also place significant value on having required disclosures not subject to the “safe harbor under
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.” 17 Thus, for example, we would oppose the
proposed amendments discussed in section III.C.1 that “would result in the elimination of
disclosures about an issuer’s status as a real estate investment trust . . . in the audited notes to the
financial statements, in reliance on disclosures within the same filing, but outside the audited
financial statements.” 18
Finally, we believe the Commission should “mandate a cross-reference in the prior location of
the disclosures [that are relocated] to assist investors in navigating the issuer’s disclosures and
help maintain the prominence and/or context of the disclosures.” 19 Cross-referencing can be a
useful tool in eliminating “repetition within filings [and better ensuring] . . . that investor
understanding is not reduced due to excessive fragmentation.” 20
Equity Compensation Plans
We support the proposed revision of Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K, but believe that all
companies should continue to report on the aggregated data provided in the table. U.S. GAAP
and SEC disclosure rules do not otherwise require disclosure of the number of securities
remaining available for future issuance.
We agree with the Commission that the existing required disaggregation of information between
equity compensation plans approved by security holders and those not approved by security
holders is no longer useful to investors due to exchange listing requirements that now mandate,
“with limited exceptions, shareholder approved plans.” 21
Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements
The lack of transparency regarding repurchase agreements was viewed as a contributing factor to
the global financial crisis. 22 As described in the proposal, “[i]n response to constituency concerns
in the wake of the global crisis . . .[i]n 2014, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and
disclosure for repurchase agreements and similar transactions.” 23 Those amendments did not
become effective until last year for most companies.

As indicated in the proposal, there are some differences in the form and content of the disclosure
requirements for repurchase agreements under U.S. GAAP versus Rule 4-08(m) of Regulation SX. 24 Given the importance of these disclosures, the relative newness of the U.S. GAAP
amendments, and the existence of differences in the form and content of the respective
requirements, we cannot support the proposed revision to Rule 4-08(m) at this time.
Legal Proceedings
We do not oppose the proposed incorporation of Item 103 of Regulation S-K into U.S. GAAP. 25
We, however, believe that such an action would fall far short of the long-standing needs and
demands of investors for better and more timely qualitative and quantitative disclosures related
to legal proceedings. 26
Disclosures relating to legal proceedings may be critical to investors in making buy-sell or hold
decisions because frequently they are associated with material cash outflows or events that have
the potential to greatly affect a company’s liquidity, capitalization or business prospects. The
existing disclosure requirements in Item 103 and U.S. GAAP simply do not provide sufficient
information necessary for investors to understand the nature, and potential magnitude and timing
of any loss contingencies relating to legal proceedings. We, therefore, would support standardsetting activities by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to resolve this gaping hole in
disclosure requirements. Finally, we do not believe that revisions “to the standards of the Public
Accounting Oversight Board . . . or the American Bar Association Statement of Policy
Regarding Lawyers’ Responses to Auditors’ Requests for Information,” are a precondition to
improving disclosures on this important topic. 27
