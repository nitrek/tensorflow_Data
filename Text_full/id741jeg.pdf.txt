INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
January 30, 2015

Timothy S. Leiman for the Division of Enforcement, Securities and
Exchange Commission
Marlon Quan, pro se and for Stewardship Investment Advisors, LLC

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
Summary

This Initial Decision of Default grants the Division of Enforcement’s Unopposed Motion for
Entry of Initial Decision by Default (Motion) and permanently bars Respondent Marlon Quan from
associating with an investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal
advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization (collectively,
associational bar), and revokes the investment adviser registration of Respondent Stewardship
Investment Advisors, LLC.
Procedural Background
Under Sections 203(e) and 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities
and Exchange Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings (OIP) against
Respondents. The OIP alleges that in February 2014, a jury in the district of Minnesota found
Respondents liable for multiple counts of securities fraud, and that in September 2014, the district
court permanently enjoined Respondents from future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of
the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, and Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8. OIP at 2.
In accordance with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(i)-(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i)-(ii),
Respondents were served with the OIP on November 7, 2014. See Marlon Quan, Admin. Proc.

Rulings Release No. 2083, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4643 (Dec. 3, 2014) (December 3 Order). On
December 3, 2014, I held a prehearing conference, attended by counsel for the Division and Quan,
representing himself pro se and Stewardship. Although Quan indicated during the prehearing
conference that he intended to file an Answer on behalf of himself and Stewardship, to date he has
failed to do so. Respondents are now in default. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f); see also
OIP at 3. On December 19, 2014, this Office received the Division’s Motion, with supporting
exhibits.1 Exhibit C to the Motion is an undated letter from Quan to the Division, in which Quan
represents that: he and Stewardship do not oppose the relief sought by the Division; he does not
intend to file an Answer on his or Stewardship’s behalf; and he understands that he is defaulting,
and thus that I likely will determine the proceedings against him and Stewardship and order the
relief sought by the Division.
Quan and Stewardship are in default for not defending the proceeding. Therefore, the
Division’s Motion is granted, and the facts alleged in the OIP are deemed true. See 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.155(a); OIP at 3. This proceeding will be determined upon consideration of the record,
including the OIP and the Division’s exhibits, as well as on facts officially noticed pursuant to
Rule 323, 17 C.F.R. § 201.323.2
Findings of Fact
Quan, age 58, is a resident of Edison, New Jersey. OIP at 1. Quan is the founder,
managing member, and principal owner of Stewardship, a registered investment adviser. Id.
Quan established Stewardship in 2001, owning and operating it ever since, and registered it with
the Commission in 2005. Id. at 1-2. Stewardship is a Delaware limited liability company and
was the investment adviser to—and managing member of—two hedge funds that Quan
controlled: Stewardship Credit Arbitrage Fund, LLC and Stewardship Credit Arbitrage Fund,
Ltd. (collectively, the SCAF Funds). Id. at 2.
From 2001 to 2009, Quan provided investors and prospective investors with preferred
placement memoranda (PPMs) and marketing materials touting the risk management techniques
that would be used to protect the SCAF Funds’ investments. Mem. Op. & Order at 3, Quan
(Sept. 19, 2014), ECF No. 577 (Op.); see OIP at 2. The promised safeguards included the use of
a “lock box” account, “full due diligence” on loan transactions, audits of “intermediaries,” and
the retention of cash collateral in a blocked account. Op. at 3; OIP at 2. These safeguards were
never put in place. Op. at 18; OIP at 2. More than half of the SCAF Funds’ portfolio was
invested in loans to a company owned by Thomas J. Petters, who purportedly used the borrowed
funds to purchase electronic merchandise to resell to “big box” retailers. Op. at 3. In reality,
Petters was operating a massive Ponzi scheme. Id. at 3-4; OIP at 2. In February 2008, when
Petters’s scheme started unraveling, Quan entered into a forbearance agreement on $110 million
of Petters’s promissory notes that had gone into arrears. Op. at 20. Although the delinquent
1

The Division’s exhibits consist of the amended complaint in Quan’s underlying district court
proceeding (Ex. A), the judgment and subsequent amended judgment (Ex. B), and a letter from
Quan to the Division (Ex. C).

Under Rule 323, I take official notice of the district court record in Quan’s underlying district
court proceeding.
2

notes represented over 25% of the SCAF Funds’ assets, Quan assured investors through a
newsletter that the SCAF Funds were performing well and that “few defaults have occurred.”
Id.; see OIP at 2. Despite having emptied a cash collateral account for the SCAF Funds as part
of the forbearance agreement on the Petters notes, Quan later represented to investors that the
account was still intact. Op. at 20.
Altogether, investors invested over $500 million in the SCAF Funds from 2001 to 2009.
Id. at 3; OIP at 2. During this period, the SCAF Funds paid Stewardship performance and
management fees (together with interest, origination, and consulting fees to Quan’s commercial
finance business), in excess of $95 million, approximately $33 million of which was distributed
to Quan. Op. at 3; OIP at 2. As a result of the fraud, SCAF Fund investors faced losses
exceeding $221 million. OIP at 2.
On February 11, 2014, after a nine-day jury trial, Respondents were found liable for
multiple counts of securities fraud, and on September 22, 2014, the district court permanently
enjoined Respondents from future violations of Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3),
Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-8.
Op. at 2; Ex. B; OIP at 2. The district court found Respondents jointly liable for disgorgement of
$80,613,589. Ex. B. The court later amended its judgment to include liability for over $16 million
in prejudgment interest. Id.
Conclusions of Law
Advisers Act Section 203(f) authorizes the Commission to impose an associational bar
against Quan if: (1) at the time of the alleged misconduct, he was associated with an investment
adviser; (2) he has been enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in Advisers Act
Section 203(e)(4); and (3) the sanction is in the public interest. 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(f). Advisers
Act Section 203(e) empowers the Commission to revoke Stewardship’s registration if: (1) the
sanction is in the public interest; and (2) the investment adviser is permanently enjoined by any
court of competent jurisdiction from “engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice . . . in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security.” 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(e)(4).
The statutory bases to impose an associational bar against Quan and to revoke
Stewardship’s registration have been satisfied. During the time of his misconduct, Quan was
associated with Stewardship, an investment adviser. Quan and Stewardship were both enjoined
from future violations of the federal securities laws, well within the meaning of “conduct . . . in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security” under Advisers Act Section 203(e)(4). 15
U.S.C. § 80b-3(e)(4), (f). Respondents did not file Answers or oppose the Motion and therefore
have not offered any evidence to refute the conclusion that the statutory bases for a sanction have
been satisfied. Accordingly, a sanction will be imposed if it is in the public interest.
Sanctions
In determining whether sanctions are in the public interest, the Commission considers the
factors set forth in Steadman v. SEC, namely: the egregiousness of the respondent’s actions; the
isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction; the degree of scienter involved; the sincerity of the
3

respondent’s assurances against future violations; the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful
nature of his conduct; and the likelihood that the respondent’s occupation will present
opportunities for future violations (Steadman factors). 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979),
aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981); see Gary M. Kornman, Exchange Act Release No.
59403, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *22 (Feb. 13, 2009), pet. denied, 592 F.3d 173 (D.C. Cir.
2010). The inquiry into the appropriate sanction to protect the public interest is flexible, and no
one factor is dispositive. Gary M. Kornman, 2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *22. The Commission
also considers the age of the violation, the degree of harm to investors and the marketplace
resulting from the violation, and the deterrent effect of administrative sanctions. See Schield
Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at *35-36 & n.46 (Jan. 31,
2006); Marshall E. Melton, Advisers Act Release No. 2151, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *4-5
(July 25, 2003). Associational bars have long been considered effective deterrence. See Guy P.
Riordan, Securities Act Release No. 9085, 2009 SEC LEXIS 4166, at *81 & n.107 (Dec. 11,
2009) (collecting cases), pet. denied, 627 F.3d 1230 (D.C. Cir. 2010).
After analyzing the public interest factors in light of the protective interests served,
Respondents’ current competence, and their risk of future misconduct, I have determined that it
is appropriate and in the public interest to bar Quan from participation in the securities industry
to the fullest extent possible, and to revoke Stewardship’s registration. See Ross Mandell,
Exchange Act Release No. 71668, 2014 SEC LEXIS 849, at *7-8 (Mar. 7, 2014). Respondents’
conduct was egregious. Respondents recruited investors through the use of fraudulent offering
and marketing materials that misrepresented safeguards in place to protect investor capital. Op.
at 3; OIP at 2. Respondents sold promissory notes issued by Petters, the perpetrator of a massive
Ponzi scheme, to the SCAF Funds, and then provided false assurances to the SCAF Funds to
conceal the fraud. Op. at 2-4; OIP at 2. Through their misconduct, Stewardship received
performance and management fees exceeding $95 million from the SCAF Funds, approximately
$33 million of which was distributed to Quan. Op. at 3; OIP at 2. As a result of the fraud, SCAF
Funds investors lost over $221 million. OIP at 2. The district court ordered Respondents jointly
and severally liable for disgorgement of $80,613,589. Ex. B. The size of the disgorgement
reflects the egregiousness of Respondents’ actions and the substantial harm that they caused their
clients. Moreover, Respondents’ conduct was recurrent and took place over the course of several
years, from 2001 to 2009, and was therefore not a “momentary lapse in judgment.” Ross
Mandell, 2014 SEC LEXIS 849, at *17-18; Op. at 23. This reflects a longstanding pattern of
violative conduct that demonstrates unfitness for the securities industry. Additionally, the
conduct continued for a year even after Quan entered into the forbearance agreement in 2008.
Moreover, Respondents were enjoined for conduct involving fraud. See Ex. B. The
Commission considers past misconduct involving fraud to be particularly egregious and
requiring a severe sanction. See Peter Siris, Exchange Act Release No. 71068, 2013 SEC
LEXIS 3924, at *23 (Dec. 12, 2013) (the Commission has “repeatedly held that conduct that
violates the antifraud provisions of the securities laws is especially serious and subject to the
severest of sanctions under the securities laws” (internal quotation marks omitted)), pet. denied,
773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Richard C. Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 12104, 1976
SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb. 12, 1976) (“When the past misconduct involves fraud, fidelity to
the public interest requires us to be mindful of the fact that the securities business is one in which
opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly and that this necessitates specialized legal
treatment.” (internal footnote omitted)). Where a respondent has been enjoined from violating
4

antifraud provisions of the securities laws, the Commission “typically” imposes a permanent bar.
Toby G. Scammell, Advisers Act Release No. 3961, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4193, at *37 (Oct. 29,
2014).
Respondents acted with scienter. See Op. at 18, 20, 23. Respondents lured investors
through fraudulent offering and marketing materials that described safeguards that were never
put in place. Id. at 18-20. Moreover, once Petters’ Ponzi scheme came to light, rather than
inform investors of the truth, Respondents concealed the situation from them and provided false
assurances, leading investors to believe their investments were safe. Id. at 20. These wrongful
acts are representative of conduct evincing a high level of scienter.
Respondents have offered no evidence that they recognize the wrongful nature of their
conduct, nor have they offered any assurance that they will not violate securities laws in the
future. Id. at 23. Although Quan has previously represented that he does not intend to return to
the securities industry, absent an associational bar there would be nothing to prevent Quan from
resuming these activities, which would present opportunities for future violations and the risk
that his conduct will be repeated. Id. “Each area of the industry covered by the [associational]
bar presents continual opportunities for similar dishonesty and abuse, and depends heavily on the
integrity of its participants and on investors’ confidence.” Ross Mandell, 2014 SEC LEXIS 849,
at *22 (internal quotation marks and alteration brackets omitted); see Richard C. Spangler, Inc.,
1976 SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34.
Although “[c]ourts have held that the existence of a past violation, without more, is not a
sufficient basis for imposing a bar[,] . . . ‘the existence of a violation raises an inference that it
will be repeated.’” Tzemach David Netzer Korem, Exchange Act Release No. 70044, 2013 SEC
LEXIS 2155, at *24 n.50 (July 26, 2013) (quoting Geiger v. SEC, 363 F.3d 481, 489 (D.C. Cir.
2004)) (alteration in internal quotation omitted). Respondents have failed to rebut that inference.
Failure to make assurances against future violations and to recognize wrongdoing demonstrates
the threat of future violations. See Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940
Release No. 2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS 2346, at *16-19 (Aug. 30, 2002).
In conclusion, it is in the public interest to impose a permanent associational bar against
Quan and to revoke Stewardship’s registration as an investment adviser.
Order
It is ORDERED that the Division of Enforcement’s Unopposed Motion for Entry of
Initial Decision by Default against Marlon Quan and Stewardship Investment Advisors, LLC, is
GRANTED.
It is FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, Marlon Quan is permanently BARRED from associating with an investment
adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or
nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

5

It is FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, the investment adviser registration of Stewardship Investment Advisors, LLC, is
REVOKED.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule of Practice 360. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file
a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of the Initial
Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the
Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest
error of fact is filed by a party, then that party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for
review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of
fact.
The Initial Decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or motion to
correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events occurs, the Initial Decision shall not become
final as to that party.
Respondents are notified that they may move to set aside the default in this case. Rule
155(b) permits the Commission, at any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to
prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion
to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to
appear or defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
