STAY ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings on January 27, 2016, pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on Respondent Moazzam
“Mark” Malik’s conviction of several felonies under New York state law, including grand
larceny, forgery, and securities fraud. Malik is currently incarcerated.
The Division of Enforcement has reported that Malik has executed an offer of settlement and
returned it to the Division. The Division will submit the offer to the Office of the Secretary, and,
upon issuance of the settlement order imposing an industry bar, the proceeding will be completely
resolved. The Division’s report and the executed offer of settlement will be construed as a joint
motion to stay pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2). Accordingly, the proceeding will be stayed
pursuant to that provision.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
