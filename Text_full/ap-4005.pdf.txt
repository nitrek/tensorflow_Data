File No. 3-16509

In the Matter of
EDWARD M. DASPIN, a/k/a “EDWARD (ED) MICHAEL”;
LUIGI AGOSTINI; and
LAWRENCE R. LUX

ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

After the Second Circuit vacated its stay of this proceeding as to Respondent Luigi
Agostini, I held a prehearing conference yesterday to discuss scheduling a hearing as to him. See
Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3980, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2422 (ALJ July
12, 2016). During the conference, I made clear that my prior stay as to Agostini—which simply
had confirmed the Second Circuit’s stay—had also been lifted. See Edward M. Daspin, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3508, 2016 SEC LEXIS 158 (ALJ Jan. 14, 2016). I also denied
Agostini’s request for an additional stay, and determined that this matter would move forward to
a hearing.
Based on the parties’ representations concerning their availability, I ORDER that the
hearing in this matter as to Luigi Agostini shall begin on September 14, 2016, in New York, New
York, at a time and specific location to be determined.
I FURTHER ORDER that witness subpoena requests are due by August 15, 2016.
Subpoena forms, as well as instructions for respondents, are available at https://www.sec.gov/alj.
