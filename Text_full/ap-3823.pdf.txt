LARRY M. PHILLIPS

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND DIRECTING PARTIES TO
HOLD PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On April 19, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents. A hearing is currently scheduled for May 31, 2016. On
May 3, the parties submitted a joint status report, confirming that Respondents have been served
with the OIP and will file answers by May 25, and requesting that the hearing be postponed and
that a prehearing conference be held on May 31.
I POSTPONE the hearing and direct the parties to hold an initial prehearing conference
without the hearing officer by May 31, 2016, to discuss each numbered item in Rule of Practice
221(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c), including the date by which each item will be accomplished. By
June 2, 2016, the parties shall file a joint prehearing conference statement, which addresses each
numbered item in Rule 221(c), includes proposed due dates where applicable (the parties may
denote that an item is “not applicable” in their filing), establishes the date the OIP was served on
Respondents in accordance with Rule 141, and proposes a procedural schedule that will result in
a hearing commencing roughly four months from the date the OIP was served on Respondents.
See 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2). The statement should also address a potential hearing location
and how many days might be necessary to complete the hearing.
In addition, Respondents should address whether they waive their right to a hearing
commencing between thirty and sixty days from service of the OIP. OIP at 5; see 15 U.S.C.
§§ 78u-3(b), 80b-3(k)(2). A subsequent prehearing conference with the hearing officer will be
scheduled if appropriate. If the parties are unable to hold a prehearing conference by May 31,
the Division shall notify my office before that date.
The parties should email courtesy copies of any filings in this proceeding in PDF textsearchable format and, when possible, Microsoft Word format, to alj@sec.gov.
