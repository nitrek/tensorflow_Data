COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), files its
complaint and alleges that:
OVERVIEW
1.

This matter involves a financial fraud conducted by certain personnel in the

accounting department of Swisher Hygiene, Inc. (“Swisher”) that began shortly
after the Charlotte, North Carolina-based hygiene and sanitation company became
a public reporting company in late 2010.
2.

Immediately after being appointed as Swisher’s Chief Financial Officer

(“CFO”) in May 2011, Michael Kipp (“Kipp”), who had previously served as

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 1 of 57

Swisher’s controller, orchestrated an earnings management scheme during the
second, third, and fourth quarters of that year.
3.

In 2011, Swisher was actively acquiring sanitation and waste management

companies.
4.

At this time, Swisher lacked effective internal control over financial

reporting. In particular, Swisher had difficulty integrating the financial reporting
systems of recently acquired companies into its own systems, had an insufficient
number of qualified accounting personnel, and placed undue emphasis on meeting
internal financial results.
5.

As Swisher’s CFO, Kipp directed the accounting entries made by Swisher

and incorporated into Swisher’s financial statements.
6.

Exploiting Swisher’s lack of effective internal controls, Kipp presided over

an accounting group that aggressively reevaluated and manipulated various
acquisition-related reserves and expenses in order to increase earnings to
predetermined targets tied to the expectations of the Company’s lenders as the
basis for future acquisition financing.
7.

Kipp carried out the fraudulent scheme with the assistance of Joanne Viard

(“Viard”), Swisher’s Director of External SEC Reporting, who was responsible for
Swisher’s acquisition accounting.
2

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 2 of 57

8.

During the closing process for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2011,

Swisher’s earnings management scheme followed a certain pattern, namely (1) the
communication of a target for Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Interest,
Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) by Kipp to accounting personnel; (2)
an initial closing process that produced results less than the target; (3) meetings
and communications through which Kipp demanded adjustments to help Swisher
meet the original target; and (4) the recording of adjusting accounting entries that
were not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
to achieve the target.
9.

After reaching the Adjusted EBITDA target, Kipp typically told his team

that additional entries would not be allowed.
10.

Kipp and Viard directed and/or recorded entries that were incorporated into

financial statements that Swisher included in quarterly reports filed with the
Commission.
11.

As the result of the earnings management scheme, Swisher issued quarterly

reports on Form 10-Q and quarterly earnings announcements that were included on
Form 8-K in 2011 that were materially misstated.

3

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 3 of 57

12.

As CFO, Kipp signed the Sarbanes-Oxley quarterly certifications and

management representation for Swisher’s Forms 10-Q filed for the second and
third quarters of 2011.
13.

Both Kipp and Viard knew or recklessly disregarded that the accounting

entries they manipulated for purposes of achieving earnings targets were not in
accordance with GAAP.
14.

Swisher received a financial benefit by using its stock (the price of which

was artificially inflated by the publicly reported inflated earnings) and/or
convertible notes to pay for a series of acquisitions during 2011.
15.

The scheme came to light in early 2012, before Swisher filed its Form 10-K

for 2011.
16.

In January 2012, Kipp summarily terminated Swisher’s controller for

refusing to make an accounting entry that the controller thought was improper.
17.

Shortly thereafter, the terminated controller provided Swisher’s general

counsel and outside auditor, BDO USA, LLP (“BDO”), with a draft letter outlining
the controller’s concerns that senior management was preparing financial
statements that met previously communicated targets.

4

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 4 of 57

18.

Upon learning of the former controller’s allegations, Swisher’s Audit

Committee commenced an internal investigation, which led to the terminations of
Kipp and Viard.
19.

In February 2013, after the conclusion of the internal investigation, Swisher

filed amended quarterly reports for the first three quarters of 2011, including
restated financial statements, to reflect adjustments to previously reported financial
information. The restatement reflects correction of entries made in furtherance of
the earnings management scheme, as well as errors largely associated with the
company’s lack of effective internal controls (also acknowledged as part of the
restatement).

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY
31.

In 2011 and 2012, Swisher Hygiene, Inc. was a Delaware corporation

headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Prior to the sale of its operating assets,
8

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 8 of 57

Swisher was a commercial hygiene company delivering essential hygiene and
sanitizing solutions to customers in a wide range of end-markets. At that time,
Swisher’s common stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act. Swisher became a public company at the end of 2010, and its stock
commenced trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) on
February 2, 2011. In November 2015, Swisher consummated the sale of the stock
of its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Swisher International, Inc., and other assets
relating to Swisher’s U.S. operations, which comprised all of Swisher’s remaining
operating interests, to Ecolab, Inc., a publically traded company. In January 2016,
NASDAQ suspended trading in Swisher’s stock, and initiated formal delisting
proceedings.
THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
A.
32.

Background and Mechanics of Swisher’s Acquisition Strategy

Swisher became a public reporting company in late 2010. From inception,

Swisher’s business strategy was to grow through acquisitions. In 2011, Swisher
acquired 63 franchises and independent businesses.
33.

Swisher’s newly acquired companies continued to maintain their own

accounting systems for a three- to six-month period after the transactions closed.

9

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 9 of 57

The acquired companies typically sent trial balances to lower-level accounting
personnel at Swisher for monthly consolidation.
34.

Viard was involved in the monthly “mapping” of trial balances for certain

acquisitions to Swisher’s accounting systems. The acquired companies’ financial
reporting systems were maintained in approximately 75 separate databases, and
different portions of each company’s accounting records were consolidated with
Swisher’s in an ad-hoc and inconsistent manner.
B.
35.

Swisher Engaged in an Earnings Management Scheme During the
Second, Third, and Fourth Quarters of 2011

Swisher reported Adjusted EBITDA in its public filings with the

Commission and to its Board of Directors.
36.

According to its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011,

Swisher defined Adjusted EBITDA as ”net loss excluding the impact of income
taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and income, foreign
currency gain, net gain/loss on debt related fair value measurements, stock based
compensation and third party costs directly related to mergers and acquisitions.”
37.

Adjusted EBITDA amounts are derived by adjusting the GAAP financial

results for certain items. Misstatements in Swisher’s Adjusted EBITDA for the
second and third quarters of 2011 resulted in misstatements in Swisher’s GAAP
financial statements.
10

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 10 of 57

38.

Swisher developed internal Adjusted EBITDA targets that were based on

what management understood to be the expectations of the Company’s lenders as
the basis for future acquisition financing.
39.

Swisher’s financial statement closing process during the second, third, and

fourth quarters of 2011 was conducted with the intent to realize targeted Adjusted
EBITDA figures, and the closing process ended immediately after achieving those
results rather than continuing through a complete analysis of all significant
accounts.
40.

Kipp e-mailed Swisher’s senior management reporting the consolidated

Adjusted EBITDA after the initial close and announced that continued efforts were
underway to identify the shortage in the preliminary results relative to expected
results.
41.

Thereafter, Kipp communicated with his corporate accounting team

regarding suggested areas and amounts for adjustments. The corporate level
accounting personnel were asked to get “into the weeds” and contribute ideas as to
how to improve earnings results.
42.

A “hit list” of potential positive adjusting entries would be compiled and the

positive adjusting entries or “good guys” were recorded.

11

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 11 of 57

43.

Accounting personnel were encouraged to find offsets for negative entries or

“bad guys.”
44.

When Swisher achieved its Adjusted EBITDA target, the financial statement

closing process concluded, and Kipp e-mailed his accounting team, announcing the
result and advised that additional entries would not be recorded.
45.

Kipp sent another e-mail to senior management announcing that the

Adjusted EBITDA figures had been achieved.
46.

For example, for the second quarter of 2011, Swisher needed $3 million of

Adjusted EBITDA to meet its predetermined target.
47.

After the initial closing process for the quarter concluded on July 23, 2011,

the Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $2.3 million. Kipp instructed
relevant accounting staff to make adjustments to achieve the $3 million targeted
amount.
48.

By July 29, 2011, Swisher’s Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was

$3 million.
49.

As the adjustments were accumulated to meet the target, Viard would update

Swisher’s Financial Statement Workbook.

12

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 12 of 57

50.

Similarly, Swisher’s forecasted Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was

$5.2 million. On October 14, 2011 following the initial closing process for the
quarter, Swisher computed its Adjusted EBITDA at $4.1 million.
51.

Kipp again instructed Swisher staff to make adjusting accounting entries to

increase the Adjusted EBITDA. Swisher ultimately reported an Adjusted EBITDA
of $5.26 million for the third quarter of 2011.
52.

The accounting adjustments directed by Kipp typically involved aggressive

re-evaluation and manipulation of various acquisition-related reserves and
expenses. Five instances of improper accounting identified are described below in
detail.
C.
53.

Improper Accounting Associated with Swisher’s Acquisition of
Choice Environmental

Three of the five accounting adjustments involved in the earnings

management scheme related to Swisher’s acquisition of Choice Environmental
(“Choice”), a Florida-based waste management and sanitation company.
54.

When accounting for its acquisition of Choice on Swisher’s financial

statements, Swisher was required to recognize and measure all of the identifiable
assets and liabilities of Choice at “fair value” as of the acquisition or closing date.

13

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 13 of 57

55.

Fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or

paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date.” (ASC 805-10-20)
56.

If the acquiring company does not have all of the information that it needs to

value the acquired company’s assets by the time it files financial statements that
cover the acquisition date, the fair values are considered provisional and can be
adjusted throughout the “measurement period,” which is up to one year after
acquisition. (ASC 805-10-25-13 through 19)
57.

Measurement period adjustments are reflected retroactively back to the

acquisition date. A measurement period adjustment can only be recorded if the
purchaser obtains new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of
the acquisition date that, if known at the time, would have affected the
measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. (ASC 805-10-25-13)
58.

Measurement period adjustments to reflect newly learned facts are recorded

on the balance sheet as an increase or decrease to goodwill.
59.

If facts and circumstances come to light during the measurement period that

did not exist as of the acquisition date, the acquiring company must account for
those changes in its post-combination financial statements in conformity with any
other applicable GAAP, typically impacting the income statement.
14

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 14 of 57

1.
60.

Background on Swisher’s Acquisition of Choice
Environmental

One of Swisher’s most significant acquisitions during 2011 was Choice, a

Florida-based waste management and sanitation company. The transaction closed
on March 1, 2011.
61.

Both Kipp (then in his capacity as Swisher’s Controller) and Viard were

responsible for setting up accruals and expenses in connection with the related
acquisition accounting.
62.

After the transaction closed, senior management closely tracked Choice’s

financial results; with projected annual revenues of approximately $76 million and
projected annual EBITDA of approximately $17 million (as of October 2011),
Choice’s performance significantly impacted Swisher’s financial results.
63.

During the second, third, and fourth quarters, Choice’s financial results

consistently failed to meet Swisher’s initial expectations.
64.

In an October 2011 e-mail to Choice’s CFO and others, Swisher’s CEO

bluntly expressed his disappointment with Choice’s financial results: “We need to
have a discussion… The 4th quarter number you are ‘selling’ needs to be
reconciled to the budget current ‘Choice’ management provided on the date of
acquisition plus the pro forma that current ‘Choice’ management provided with

15

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 15 of 57

synergies for [two specific transactions]. We paid for the EBITDA number that
management provided and we expect to see it.”
65.

As an operating division of Swisher, Choice’s disappointing financial results

during the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2011 were the primary driver of the
earnings management scheme.
2.
66.

Improper Adjustment of a Choice Employee’s Salary Expense
(Kipp and Viard: Second and Third Quarters of 2011)

During 2011, Swisher terminated certain employees of the acquired

companies after the acquisition dates and reclassified the previously recorded
salary expenses for those employees to the opening balance of goodwill, thereby
increasing Swisher’s earnings.
67.

Although contingent payments to employees may be included as part of a

business combination exchange, classification of post-merger salary expenses as
acquisition costs requires a determination that the subsequent salary expenses, as
“contingent consideration,” were specifically contemplated as part of the business
combination, and existed at the date of acquisition, rather than a subsequent,
separate transaction. (ASC 805-10-55-24 to 25)
68.

In July 2011, after learning that Swisher had not met its Adjusted EBITDA

target for the second quarter, Viard, at Kipp’s direction, reclassified the salary
expense of Choice’s Chief Operating Officer for that quarter as a severance
16

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 16 of 57

payment. This adjusting entry increased goodwill, reduced Swisher’s second
quarter expenses, and enabled the company to meet its second quarter Adjusted
EBITDA target.
69.

At the same time, Viard also reclassified the accrued salary expense for this

employee for the third quarter to goodwill, thus reducing expenses for that quarter.
70.

Choice’s Chief Operating Officer never agreed to a severance arrangement

and never executed a written severance agreement at the time of the merger.
71.

Because there was no severance agreement in place prior to the acquisition,

this accounting adjustment violated GAAP and was improperly undertaken in
furtherance of the earnings management scheme.
72.

Kipp and Viard knew that the reclassification of this employee’s salary from

an expense to goodwill was made to meet earnings targets.
73.

Kipp and Viard also knew that they lacked sufficient documentary support

for this adjustment.
74.

As part of Swisher’s restatement, these adjusting entries (which had

increased Swisher’s Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $112,000 and $462,000
in the second and third quarters, respectively) were reversed and reclassified as
salary expense.

3.

75.

Improper Treatment of a Purportedly Unfavorable Contract
as an Acquisition Expense (Kipp and Viard; Second and
Third Quarters)

In accounting parlance, an “unfavorable contract” is one that has terms that

are unfavorable relative to market terms. (ASC 805-20-55-31)
76.

When a contract is acquired as part of an acquisition, the acquiring company

typically performs an analysis to determine if the contract is “out of market” or
“unfavorable,” often using valuation specialists to make that determination.
77.

In making this determination, the issue is not whether a contract is

profitable, but whether it is less profitable than similar contracts negotiated at
prevailing “market” terms.
78.

For an unfavorable contract, the acquiring entity must recognize a liability at

fair value as of the acquisition date, establish a reserve for that liability, and
amortize that liability against the reserve over the life of the contract.
79.

Swisher, in violation of GAAP, improperly reclassified a waste services

contract covering a portion of Lee County, Florida (the “Lee County contract”) as
an “unfavorable contract,” thereby increasing earnings by $182,000 and $90,000 in
the second and third quarters respectively.

18

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 18 of 57

80.

Swisher assumed the contract through the acquisition of Choice. Prior to the

acquisition, Choice was having difficulties servicing the contract as required by
Lee County.
81.

As a result of these difficulties, Choice was required to make changes to the

manner in which it serviced the contract, which resulted in additional operating
expenses to service the contract.
82.

The monthly cost estimates for these additional operating expenses were

$39,400.
83.

After receiving an e-mail from Swisher’s CEO identifying the additional

costs associated with operating the Lee County contract, Kipp tasked Viard with
making a related purchase accounting adjustment, and identified the issue as an
“open item” to help achieve Adjusted EBITDA targets.
84.

Viard raised the issue with a representative from a third-party valuation

consulting firm that Swisher used in connection with its acquisition accounting. In
a July 24, 2011 e-mail to the valuation specialist, Viard stated: “I am getting a lot
of pressure to record a liability for an underwater contract for Lee county [sic] at
Choice. The issue I have is that the president and CFO of Choice keep telling me
that the Lee county contract operates more efficiently than the majority of their

19

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 19 of 57

contracts. Therefore, there is no like comparable contract that I could easily
compared [sic] margins and prove that it is underwater.”
85.

The valuation specialist expressed skepticism about classifying the Lee

County contract as unfavorable. Specifically, he responded to Viard’s e-mail as
follows: “The clause was in the contract that was agreed to. It may be performing
poorer than expected, but seems to be within the allowable operating margins
given the allowable structure of the final deal given the contract.”
86.

Nevertheless, Viard chose to classify the Lee County contract as

unfavorable. This allowed Swisher to treat the expenses from the Lee County
contract as a cost of acquisition, thus removing those expenses from the income
statement and increasing earnings.
87.

Kipp and Viard were fully aware that the accounting treatment of this

contract, which was ultimately reversed and reclassified as part of the restatement,
was chosen in order to increase Swisher’s Adjusted EBITDA so that it could meet
an internal target.
88.

Viard, aware of the earnings management scheme, failed to perform the

necessary analysis or obtained the requisite documentation to support the adjusting
accounting entry.

89.

Manipulation of Choice’s Insurance Reserves
(Kipp; Third Quarter of 2011)

Swisher also manipulated insurance reserves in order to reach Adjusted

EBITDA targets in the third quarter of 2011.
90.

In particular, Kipp directed a reduction of Choice’s reserve for workers’

compensation expense in order to meet earnings targets.
91.

Specifically, during the third quarter closing process, Kipp engaged in the

following e-mail exchange with Choice’s CFO:
Kipp: Please call me as soon as possible. I need to talk to you about
your Q3 numbers. I need you to go back and squeeze them for
an additional $220K of EBITDA. I suspect that you should
have room in some of your reserves. You should have $300K
of Workers comp accruals we set up on the operating balance
sheet that should still be there.
Choice CFO: Mike – in the last 2 days I had Ken analyze our general
insurance reserve – and I know we have about $70K there. …I
need to look at the Workers Comp – Ken was looking into that,
but we just had the audit and haven’t got the results …so we
didn’t want to touch it yet…but if we are at the “rainy day” then
maybe we take it now. Besides those 2 items…we scrubbed the
21

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 21 of 57

hell out of our #s this month hoping to get closer to budget.
Overall I think I can take the $225 out of reserves…but I will
leave me naked on reserves after this.
Kipp: Do your best to get to $200K. We need to stretch a bit to get to
the numbers in Q3. I think we all will be a bit bare. At the end
of the day if we get to the number I will let some come back
your way. Can I get a confirmation that you can do 200K
today? Tell me where to book it by account up here and we
will do it in consolidation.
Choice CFO: Mike – here is what I have for you:
$50,000 of General Insurance Reserve ….
$175,000 of Workers Comp. Insurance ….
As I stated earlier, the cupboard is pretty bare now.
Kipp: I appreciate the help. I will try to help you refill the cupboard
as we go forward.
92.

Kipp later sent an e-mail to another member of the accounting staff

indicating that Swisher would “refill the cookie jar” using items to be found in a
monthly operating review.

22

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 22 of 57

93.

By reducing the workers compensation insurance reserve by $175,000, Kipp

enabled Swisher to increase its earnings for the quarter by a corresponding amount.
94.

Kipp directed the adjustments to the worker’s compensation insurance

reserve solely for the purpose of achieving earnings targets, without any regard to
appropriate accounting treatment.
95.

The associated $175,000 increase to earnings from the adjustment to the

worker’s compensation insurance reserves did not comply with GAAP and was
reversed as part of the restatement based on a lack of supporting documentation for
the valuation of the reserve at the time of acquisition.

Manipulation of “Earnout” Reserve in Connection with Swisher’s
Acquisition of En-Viro Solutions, Inc. (Kipp and Viard; Third
Quarter of 2011)

Swisher also made adjustments to its accounting for an “earnout” reserve

associated with the January 2011 acquisition of En-Viro Solutions, Inc. (“Enviro”), a waste management company based in Seattle, Washington, in order to
achieve targeted results in the third quarter of 2011.
97.

An earnout is a contractual obligation whereby the purchaser of a business

agrees to pay the seller additional future consideration based on the acquired
business achieving certain future financial goals. The term “earnout” refers to a
pricing structure in mergers and acquisitions where the sellers must “earn” part of
23

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 23 of 57

the purchase price based on the performance of the business following the
acquisition.
98.

The appropriate accounting treatment for an earnout, also referred to as

“contingent consideration,” is to reflect the anticipated future payments at fair
value on the balance sheet at the time of acquisition. An earnout must be both
probable and subject to reasonable estimation at the time it is initially recorded.
(ASC 805-20-25-15A, 805-30-25-5 & 805-30-35-1).
99.

Subsequent to the acquisition, changes in the fair value of an associated

earnout are accounted for in one of two ways.
100. If the change in fair value is a result of additional information that existed at
the acquisition date, the resulting change is corrected retrospectively to the
provisional balance sheet amounts recorded to goodwill and the associated earnout
accrual.
101. If the change in fair value is a result of events that occurred after the
acquisition date, the resulting change is recorded in the income statement as either
an increase or decrease in earnings.
102. In connection with the En-viro acquisition, in January 2011, Viard recorded
a $1 million earnout reserve that corresponded to anticipated future quarterly
payments representing 10% of the company’s “Gross Margin generated on service
24

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 24 of 57

revenue,” (“gross margin revenue”) i.e., the dollar amount by which gross revenues
exceeded associated service costs.
103. At that time, En-viro’s annual gross margin revenue was approximately $1
million based on its existing customer base.
104. Based on past performance, the earnout could only have reasonably been
expected to generate approximately $100,000 per year, or $300,000 over a threeyear period.
105. The historical financial information included in Viard’s associated
“Purchase Accounting Workbook” did not support an earnout greater than
$300,000.
106. In February 2011, a Swisher employee involved in the acquisition sent Viard
an e-mail reflecting the anticipated timing of the earnout payments. This analysis
reflected an increase in the quarterly earnout amount over the three year period and
total payments equaling $1,000,000.
107. Viard copied and pasted the e-mail into the associated workbook. Viard did
not fair value the earnout and performed no due diligence on this entry.
108. Kipp and Viard aggressively reevaluated the reserve in connection with the
earnings management scheme during the closing process for the third quarter of
2011.
25

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 25 of 57

109. Specifically, on October 15, 2011, during the third quarter closing process,
Kipp and Viard had the following e-mail exchange:
Kipp:

How much of the BDO accrual is for the 2011 audit?

Didn’t we leave something in for that? To your point, technically we
probably should not be accruing any of that since the service hasn’t
been performed. Any thoughts? I need to get about $300K in
expense reductions. This could be one.
Viard:

The Enviro earnout may have some potential, but may be

(sic) would be stretching it. It is a 3-year total $1M pay out and they
have not been making the full payments, but again they have 3 years
to hit the revenue targets. The payments have been around $20-30K a
quarter… We haven’t wanted to reverse anything just yet, given that
they have 3 years, but it likely (sic) that they will not get the full $1M.
What have we done about the Mt. Hood profit sharing accrual? . . . .
This is $180K.
Kipp:

How would the earn-out be booked? Wouldn’t that be an

adjustment to goodwill rather than the P&L?
Viard:

No – it is contingent consideration. Fair value at the time

of acquisition and subsequent changes go through the P&L. As long
26

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 26 of 57

as the changes are not material I wouldn’t need to disclose. I am not
positive where on the income statement to put it.
Kipp:

Can you do a quick calculation of what the reserve

adjustment would be if the remaining payments were $25K/Qtr. How
much of the Earn-out can be bring down to earnings?
Viard:

It is anywhere from $200K to 700K. . . . The only risk we

have is if they finally start to make their numbers.
***
Viard:

Do you want to run it through SG&A?

Kipp:

Where should it go? I would like it in EBITDA.

110. Following the e-mail exchange above, Viard reached out to two Swisher
employees involved in the acquisition for their thoughts on what the remaining
payout would be. In response, Kipp said:
For this analysis, I would assume they earn no more than 50% of the
contractual bonus in any period. I have reviewed the assumptions with
[Swisher’s CEO] and [Swisher’s EVP]. They are good with it. Please
finalize and send a journal entry to [Swisher’s controller].

27

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 27 of 57

111. During the closing process for the third quarter of 2011, Viard ultimately
reduced improperly the Enviro earnout reserve by $500,000, with a corresponding
increase to earnings for that quarter.
112. Viard made this accounting adjustment without documenting any analysis as
to whether the entire $500,000 reduction was attributable to newly acquired
information.
113. Viard’s failure to assess whether any portion of the adjustment was the result
of facts or circumstances that existed at the time of acquisition was, at a minimum,
severely reckless.
114. Had Viard, in connection with determining how to book the reduction in the
earnout reserve, considered whether the initial valuation was appropriate, she
would have determined that at least a portion of the excess reserve was attributable
to information that existed at the time of the acquisition, and thus should have been
booked through goodwill, not earnings.
115. In a presentation to the Swisher’s Board of Directors in connection with the
acquisition on En-Viro, those most familiar with the transaction only valued the
earnout at approximately $700,000, rather than the $1 million that Viard had
recorded. This indicates that at least $300,000 of the reduction to the $1 million

28

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 28 of 57

earnout was attributable to information known when the earnout was initially
recoded, rather than information acquired after the merger closed.
116. Viard proposed another adjustment to the earnout in the Fourth Quarter of
2011, and acknowledged at that time that the adjustment would “leave just enough
room to cover the remaining Enviro earnout.” She further noted that there would
not “be any room to adjust in the future” and that there was a potential that they
would have to pay more in the future.
117. Kipp’s conduct in connection with this transaction reflects his fraudulent
intent. When Viard attempted to obtain more information to support the
accounting adjustment, Kipp stopped her further inquiry.
118. Kipp provided Viard the assumptions to use in her analysis, but there is no
evidence that those assumptions were supported by anything other than the desire
to obtain the right number for EBITDA purposes.
119. Kipp also controlled the stream of information supporting the accounting
adjustment, and Kipp never obtained the requisite documentation to support the
adjustment.
120. Given that this accounting adjustment arose from Kipp’s request for
additional expense reductions in connection with the earnings management
scheme, both Kipp and Viard acted knowingly or recklessly.
29

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 29 of 57

121. The subsequent $500,000 adjustment was reversed as part of the
restatement, based on the fact that the initial valuation of the earnout lacked any
supporting documentation.
122. The independent auditing firm retained by Swisher’s audit committee during
the internal investigation fair valued the earnout at $350,000. As part of Swisher’s
year-end audit for 2011, BDO fair valued the earnout at $300,000.
E.

Manipulation of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (Kipp;
Fourth Quarter)

123. In connection with the closing process for the second quarter of 2011, Kipp
determined to apply a new methodology for calculating Swisher’s allowance for
doubtful accounts.
124. Specifically, using historical monthly write-offs (apparently across all
divisions and recent acquisitions) for the preceding 5 months (with certain onetime adjustments) as a percentage of credit sales for the same period, Swisher
multiplied the resulting percentage by associated accounts receivable.
125. Applying this methodology in the second quarter of 2011, Kipp was able to
conclude that the allowance for doubtful accounts that had been booked was too
high and that a write-down to the reserve was appropriate.
126. Kipp used two different methodologies to calculate the reserve in the second
quarter of 2011, with only the second methodology disclosed to BDO.
30

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 30 of 57

127. Initially, the staff accountant responsible for preparing the accounts
receivable analysis applied a 0.5% rate to calculate the reserve. That analysis
resulted in the reserve being overstated by approximately $361,000.
128. Based on that analysis, Swisher reduced the reserve by $250,000 (the
remaining excess reserve, $125,000, appears to have been re-classified to reserve
against a note that Swisher was having difficulty collecting).
129. Less than two weeks later, the staff accountant prepared a second analysis of
accounts receivable. For that analysis, she used the 0.3% rate, which generated an
additional $330,000 of excess reserve.
130. Ultimately, Swisher booked both adjustments and reduced the reserve by
$580,000.
131. Contemporaneous e-mails indicate that Kipp viewed the overstated reserve
as an earnings management cushion/tool, and ultimately determined to book the
second adjustment to the reserve only after sufficient other adjustments had been
made to hit the earnings targets for that quarter.
132. For example, in connection with the closing process for the second quarter
of 2011, e-mails indicate that Kipp delayed making a final determination as to the
size of the second adjustment to Swisher’s allowance for doubtful accounts until he
first confirmed that accounting personnel had made other requested adjustments.
31

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 31 of 57

133. On July 26, 2011, Kipp bluntly e-mailed a member of the accounting
department: “I need about 250K in income to get to 3MM.” After the employee
responded with some corresponding adjustments short of the requested amount,
Kipp responded: “Let’s work up the number. If we are short. [sic] We will get it in
bad debt.”
134. Earlier that day, a lower level accountant at Swisher told Kipp in an e-mail
that she had “accidently posted” a $330,000 adjustment to the reserve, and
indicated that the final entry would be posted that day, the final day by which Kipp
indicated had that the earnings targets were to be met.
135. Using the same methodology and employing the 0.3% rate, the reserve was
further reduced in in the third quarter of 2011 by approximately $150,000.
136. During the fourth quarter of 2011, accounting personnel discovered that
Swisher was significantly under-reserved in this area because the company had
failed to include write-offs associated with Choice’s operations after that company
was acquired in March 2011.
137. The terminated controller initially discovered the discrepancy and provided
the information to Kipp, who insisted that Swisher would not book the adjustment
and insisted that the controller find a way to fix it.

32

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 32 of 57

138. After the controller declined to make any adjustments (which would have
resulted in a reduction to earnings), Kipp instructed another employee to come up
with some solution that would not impact earnings.
139. In response, that employee obtained a spreadsheet of Swisher’s acquisitions
during the year, and arbitrarily increased the previously recorded reserves for each
company by approximately 5%, thereby increasing the reserve for doubtful
accounts by approximately $550,000 without impacting earnings, i.e. with
corresponding debits to the goodwill associated with the acquisitions.
140. The employee provided his “solution” to Kipp, who authorized him to book
the associated reserve entry.
F.

The Earnings Management Scheme Unraveled in the Fourth
Quarter of 2011

141. Swisher’s earnings management scheme unraveled in early 2012 when, as
part of the year-end financial statement closing process, Kipp terminated the
controller after the controller refused to record an accounting entry for which the
controller thought there was no plausible justification other than to hit a target.
142. After articulating why he believed the entry was inappropriate, the controller
sent an e-mail, dated January 23, 2012, to Kipp saying “I’ll run it by BDO so that
we are all on the same page.”

33

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 33 of 57

143. The next morning Kipp sent the controller the following response: “You’ll
run it by me since I am the chief accounting officer. I am out of patience with
this.”
144. Kipp terminated the controller the next day.
145. The controller’s performance reviews showed that the controller was
meeting or exceeding all relevant performance standards.
146. The terminated controller subsequently met with Swisher’s General Counsel
and BDO and provided them with a draft letter to the audit committee.
147. The letter raised several accounting issues, including the allegation that
Swisher was using purchase accounting to manage reported results to previously
determined Adjusted EBITDA targets.
148. The controller’s letter also alleged that Swisher’s standard practice was to
put reserves on the opening balance sheet for a number of potential losses and for
contingent consideration. The reserves were typically recorded at their highest
possible amount so that they could be considered part of the purchase price of the
acquired entity and thus offset against goodwill. Swisher would later reduce the
inflated reserves and reflect the reduction as an increase to income.

34

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 34 of 57

149. Similarly, rather than expensing the costs that arose in connection with the
ongoing operation of the acquired businesses, Swisher would frequently place
those costs on the opening balance sheet as part of goodwill.
150. After learning of the former controller’s allegations, in March 2012
Swisher’s audit committee hired the law firm of Holland & Knight to conduct an
internal investigation. Holland & Knight and the forensic accounting firm Cherry
Bekaert & Holland reviewed the accounting entries related to each of the 63
acquisitions made by Swisher in 2011.
151. On March 28, 2012, Swisher announced that the quarterly reports for 2011
should no longer be relied upon and might require restatement.
152. On May 17, 2012, Swisher announced that it was firing Kipp and Viard.
153. In management representation letters sent to BDO in connection with the
firm’s reviews conducted in the second and third quarters of 2011, while
orchestrating the earnings management scheme, Kipp falsely represented that he
had “no knowledge of [f]raud or suspected fraud involving management or
involving employees who have significant roles in internal controls,” and that he
had “not identified any significant deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in
the design or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the

35

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 35 of 57

Company’s ability to record, process, summarize, and report interim financial
data.”
G.

Swisher Restated its Financial Results for the First Three
Quarters of 2011

154. As a result of Swisher’s earnings management and departure from GAAP,
the internal investigators identified approximately 20 accounts that were materially
misstated in 2011.
155. Consequently, on February 19, 20 and 21, 2013, Swisher filed amended
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2011,
June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011, respectively. The following table details
the restatement effect on Swisher’s originally reported net loss before income taxes
(in 000s):

156. The restatement reflects entries made in furtherance of the earnings
management scheme, as well as errors largely associated with the company’s lack
of effective internal controls (also acknowledged as part of the restatement).
157. The five instances of acquisition-related earnings management adjustments
described above (all of which were reversed as part of the restatement) had
36

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 36 of 57

increased Swisher’s previously reported earnings by approximately $500,000
(4.1%) and $1,500,000 (57%) in the second and third quarters of 2011,
respectively.
158. These five accounting adjustments had a material impact on Swisher’s
financial statements, in part because they were made to further an earnings
management scheme.
159. Swisher also restated Adjusted EBITDA as follows (in 000s):

Materially Deficient Internal Controls

160. Swisher acknowledged in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2011, filed on February 26, 2013, and in its restated Forms 10-Q for 2011 that
as of those reporting periods, Swisher’s internal control over financial reporting
and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as a result of material
weakness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting.
161. Among the deficiencies identified were the placement of an undue emphasis
on internal anticipated financial results in communications during the financial
statement close process and allowing for overrides of entity-level controls during
37

Case 3:16-cv-00258 Document 1 Filed 05/24/16 Page 37 of 57

the financial reporting close process resulting in a number of journal entries having
either insufficient or no support.
162. Swisher failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal
accounting controls permitting the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, particularly with respect to the financial close process.
163. As CFO, Kipp knowingly failed to implement a system of internal
accounting controls and knowingly falsified accounts.
164. Kipp knowingly circumvented the controls, and knowingly falsified
accounting records in order to produce financial statements in alignment with
targeted numbers and such management override of controls was a material
weakness at Swisher.
165. Viard, directly or indirectly, falsified Swisher’s accounting records or caused
such records to be falsified in furtherance of the earnings management scheme.
166. In Swisher’s most recent 10-K, both Swisher and BDO acknowledged that
Swisher did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
167. Swisher’s financial statement closing process during the second, third, and
fourth quarters of 2011 was conducted with the intent to realize targeted Adjusted
EBITDA figures, and the closing process ended immediately after achieving those
38
