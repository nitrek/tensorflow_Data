Release No. 4101/August 30, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File Nos. 3-16227, 3-16229

In the Matter of
MIDDLEBURY SECURITIES, LLC

NOTICE

GREGORY OSBORN

On June 14, 2016, these proceedings were consolidated in their entirety and I ordered a
briefing schedule that set a July 29 deadline for motions for summary disposition, an August 19
deadline for oppositions, and an August 31 deadline for replies. Middlebury Sec., LLC, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3915, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2100. Thereafter, Respondent Gregory Osborn
emailed the Division of Enforcement and members of this office, prompting me to instruct the
parties that if they wish me to consider any future submissions, they must file hard copies with the
Office of the Secretary, and further prompting me to order Osborn to stop sending this office emails,
by cc or otherwise, unless they are courtesy copies of filings. Middlebury Sec., LLC, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 4034, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2659 (ALJ Aug. 2, 2016).
On August 26, Osborn violated my August 2 order by emailing my office regarding the
status and due date of his opposition. The August 19 deadline for oppositions has come and gone.
As such, the Division’s motion for summary disposition as to Osborn is ripe for decision, and the
Division shall not file a reply unless I direct otherwise.
Further, the parties are reminded that in Commission administrative proceedings, relief is
properly requested by filing a motion rather than sending a letter addressed to the administrative law
judge. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.152, .154 (specifying the form of filings, including motions). I note
that the Commission’s Rules of Practice do not require that motions be bound, only that they be
stapled in the upper left corner. 17 C.F.R. § 201.152(a)(6). Also, I consider the requirement that a
motion be “accompanied by a written brief of the points and authorities relied upon” satisfied where
the motion and the written brief are combined in one document. 17 C.F.R. § 201.154(a).
