For Review of Action Taken by FINRA

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
REGISTERED SECURITIES ASSOCIATION—REVIEW OF ASSOCIATION ACTION
DENYING REQUEST TO PROCESS CORPORATE ACTION
Registered securities association, in declining to process issuer's proposed name change,
made findings that are not supported by the record. Held, review proceeding is
remanded.
APPEARANCES:

Appeal filed: October 21, 2015
Last brief received: February 2, 2016
AutoChina International Limited ("AutoChina" or the "Company"), an issuer of securities

AutoChina's request that FINRA process and announce its name change to Fincera, Inc.2 FINRA
found that AutoChina's request was deficient under FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3)(3) because FINRA
had actual knowledge that AutoChina was the subject of a civil action related to fraud or
securities law violations.3 FINRA then determined that processing the name change would pose
too great a risk to the investing public and the securities markets and declined to process the
request.4 In denying the request FINRA stated that AutoChina had "fail[ed] to address" why
certain defendants in the civil action "are apparently still employed by or affiliated with
AutoChina," and that failure "weighs heavily against processing the proposed name change."
In its appeal, AutoChina does not dispute FINRA's finding that its request was deficient;
rather, AutoChina disputes FINRA's finding that certain defendants in the civil action are
employed by or affiliated with AutoChina, and our own review of the record has identified no
evidence to support FINRA's finding. As explained below, we do not remand on the issue of
whether the request was deficient under FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3)(3). We are remanding the
proceeding to FINRA to determine the employment and/or affiliation status of those defendants,
and in light of those findings, determine whether denying the requested name change is
necessary for the protection of investors and the public interest. As outlined below, FINRA
should ensure that the record contains all of the evidence upon which its action is taken.

AutoChina's Request that FINRA Process Company-Related Actions

FINRA processes requests from issuers of securities traded on the over-the-counter
markets to announce and publish certain corporate actions. These actions include both actions
provided for in Exchange Act Rule 10b-17,5 such as dividends and stock splits (collectively
"SEA Rule 10b-17 Actions") and "'Other Company-Related Actions,' includ[ing] . . . any
issuance or change to a symbol or name."6 FINRA publishes announcements of these actions on
its website. On February 17, 2015, AutoChina asked FINRA to process and announce a stock

FINRA Rule 6490 sets forth requirements and procedures governing FINRA's review and
processing of documents related to, among other things, "any issuance or change to a symbol or
name" "to facilitate the orderly trading and settlement" of securities traded on the over-thecounter markets. Rule 6490(a)(1), (2).
3

Rule 6490(d)(3)(3) permits FINRA to base a deficiency determination on FINRA's
"actual knowledge that the issuer [or certain other persons] . . . are the subject of . . . a civil or
criminal action related to fraud or securities laws violations."

FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3) provides that "[i]In circumstances where an SEA Rule 10b-17
Action or Other Company-Related Action is deemed deficient, the Department may determine
that it is necessary for the protection of investors, the public interest and to maintain fair and
orderly markets, that documentation related to such SEA Rule 10b-17 Action or Other CompanyRelated Action will not be processed."

split, and on June 8, 2015, while its stock split request was still under review, the Company
asked FINRA to process and announce a name change to Fincera, Inc.7
In submitting the stock split request, AutoChina disclosed to FINRA that it had "recently
settled a regulatory action with the SEC." FINRA staff asked AutoChina to provide additional
information and documents related to its request.8 Within a week after beginning its review,
FINRA staff discovered the 2014 Commission litigation release announcing a settlement with
two defendants in a civil action ("Civil Action") against AutoChina, its former Secretary Hui Kai
Yan ("Yan"), eight other individuals, and two limited corporations (together, the "AutoChina
Defendants").9 On February 27, AutoChina provided a summary of salient facts about the Civil
Action, provided additional information about the Commission's investigation that resulted in the
Civil Action, made representations about AutoChina's cooperation with the investigation and
compliance with the terms of the settlement, and noted, among other things, that no officers or
directors other than Yan were named in the complaint filed in the Civil Action ("Complaint")
and that the Commission did not make any allegations regarding AutoChina's financial reporting
or operations.10
7

AutoChina apparently submitted the request electronically. The record contains a printout of the form AutoChina submitted, but not the attachment in pdf format that the form
references. The record does not contain any communication from FINRA acknowledging the
receipt of the request, or any documents obtained or generated during FINRA's review of the
request. On remand, FINRA should ensure that the record contains all of the evidence upon
which its action is taken.
AutoChina's application to the Commission sought review of FINRA's denial of both the
request for a name change and request for a stock split. In its reply brief, AutoChina withdrew
its application with respect to the request to process a stock split. We have reviewed documents
concerning FINRA's review of the stock split request only to the extent they bear on FINRA's
decision regarding the name change.
8

Few of the documents the staff requested are contained in the record certified to us. For
example, FINRA asked for ten documents in an e-mail dated February 18, 2015. AutoChina
replied by e-mail on February 24, 2015, referring to "the attached letter and related documents in
response to the questions raised below." However, the record contains only the text of the
February 24 e-mail.

SEC v. AutoChina Int'l Ltd., Litigation Rel. No. 23033, 2014 WL 2915933 (June 27,
2014). In an e-mail exchange dated February 25, 2015, the staff asked AutoChina whether the
litigation release related to the Company, and AutoChina confirmed that it did.
10

The Complaint alleged that the AutoChina Defendants fraudulently manipulated
AutoChina's shares to increase AutoChina's trading volume and create the appearance of
liquidity, thereby enhancing the ability of AutoChina's chairman and chief executive officer,
Yong Hui Li ("Li"), to obtain financing for the Company. The Complaint further alleged that the
stock manipulation involved 26 brokerage accounts at E*Trade Financial Corporation
("E*Trade") into which more than $60 million were deposited over four months and through
which millions of shares of AutoChina stock were sold. The Complaint alleged that accountopening documents at E*Trade indicated that six of the individual defendants were employees of

B.

FINRA's Denial of AutoChina's Requests

On August 21, 2015, FINRA's Department of Market Operations ("Department") issued a
notice denying AutoChina's requests ("Deficiency Notice"), based on its determination that the
requests were deficient under FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3)(3) and that denying the requests was
"necessary for the protection of investors, the public interest, and to maintain fair and orderly
markets." In explaining its determination, the Department relied on FINRA's actual knowledge
of the Civil Action, the allegations of the Complaint, and the Final Judgments.11
On August 28, 2015, AutoChina appealed the Department's determination to a
subcommittee of FINRA's Uniform Practice Code Committee ("Subcommittee"), asserting that
"[t]he [Deficiency] Notice . . . fails to point out that the [Defaulting Defendants] are not
employed by the Company (and were not so employed at the time of the Civil Action)."12 The
Company also made several arguments as to why, in its view, refusing to process the requests
was detrimental to the public interest.13
On September 29, 2015, the Subcommittee denied AutoChina's requests to process the
stock split and name change. The Subcommittee's decision said it was reached "[a]fter careful
(. . . continued)
AutoChina. It also alleged that one of the individual defendants was a manager at an AutoChina
subsidiary and another was a former manager at AutoChina, that four of the individual
defendants were relatives of Li, and that AutoChina identified one of the corporate defendants as
an "affiliate" on a Form 20-F filed with the Commission in 2011 for the period ending December
31, 2010. SEC v. AutoChina Int'l Ltd., No. 12-cv-10643-GAO (D. Mass.) (complaint filed Apr.
11, 2012).
On June 25, 2014, the district court entered judgments by consent against AutoChina and
Yan (the "Final Judgments"). In consenting to the entry of the Final Judgments, AutoChina and
Yan neither admitted nor denied the allegations of the Complaint. The Final Judgments
permanently enjoined AutoChina and Yan from future violations of the antifraud provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the Exchange
Act. The district court also ordered AutoChina to pay a civil penalty of $4.35 million and
permanently barred Yan from serving as an officer or director of any public company. The court
entered default judgments as to the remaining defendants (the "Defaulting Defendants") on
October 24, 2014.
11

The Department did not explain how it obtained "actual knowledge" as required by
FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3)(3), but it cited both the Complaint and the litigation release.
12

AutoChina also noted that the Department inaccurately stated in the Deficiency Notice
that the Civil Action was still pending against the Defaulting Defendants. As noted above, a
final judgment was entered by default against those defendants in October 2014.
13

After acknowledging the appeal, the Subcommittee instructed the Department to submit
AutoChina's company-related action notification form; the Department's deficiency notice; and
the Department's documentation in support of the deficiency notice. The record does not show
that the Department submitted these documents.

5
consideration of AutoChina's request, the Department's denial of that request, and the additional
supporting documentation that the Department and AutoChina submitted in this appeal." The
Subcommittee agreed that the Department had correctly found AutoChina's request deficient
under Rule 6490(d)(3)(3), based on the settlement of the Civil Action. In its public interest
analysis, the Subcommittee found the Civil Action and the Final Judgment against AutoChina
"very serious," particularly in light of "the gravity of the violations at issue" and AutoChina's
proposed corporate actions. The Subcommittee stated that "the Commission's investigation,
which led to the filing of the [Civil Action], initially focused on the conduct of Li and
AutoChina's current Chief Financial Officer," and found that "the continued involvement of
executives, managers, and directors who were employed with AutoChina when the misconduct
occurred raises significant concerns about the company-related actions that AutoChina has
requested." The Subcommittee also found that although Yan was the only former senior
executive and director named as a defendant in the Complaint,
[the Complaint] also details misconduct by several other individuals and corporate
entities affiliated with AutoChina and Li. . . . Although AutoChina has stated that
Yan is no longer with the company, it has made no such representations with
regard to the other AutoChina Defendants. AutoChina's failure to address why
the other AutoChina Defendants are apparently still employed by or affiliated
with AutoChina weighs heavily against processing the company's proposed name
change and forward stock split.
The Subcommittee noted that the Civil Action had resulted in AutoChina's payment of
$4.35 million as a civil penalty a little more than a year previously and stated that the AutoChina
Defendants "have demonstrated a profound disregard for securities regulation." Under these
circumstances, the Subcommittee affirmed the Department's denial, concluding that the
processing of AutoChina's proposed actions would pose too much risk to the investing public
and the securities markets.14

ANALYSIS

Standard of Review

Exchange Act Section 19(f) governs our review of a self-regulatory organization's denial
of access to services.15 Under Section 19(f), we must dismiss AutoChina's application for review
if we find that (i) the specific grounds on which FINRA based its denial exist in fact; (ii) the
denial was in accordance with FINRA's rules; and (iii) those rules are, and were applied in a
manner, consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act.16

14

Under FINRA Rule 6490(e), the Subcommittee's decision is FINRA's final decision in
this matter.

"any person with respect to access to services offered" by the SRO); see, e.g., Positron Corp.,

19(f) to review of FINRA denial of request to process corporate actions).

B.

Certain Grounds for the Denial do not Exist in Fact

We first analyzed a denial of a Company-Related Action request under FINRA Rule
6490(d)(3) in mPhase Technologies, Inc., where we explained:
FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3) requires FINRA to conduct a two-step analysis in
determining whether to process a Company-Related Action request. First, FINRA
must assess whether the issuer's request is deficient. As the Rule states, FINRA's
deficiency determination "shall" be based "solely . . . [on] one or more" of the five
enumerated factors . . . . Second, in the event that FINRA deems an issuer's
request deficient, FINRA then "may determine" not to process the issuer's request
if it finds that denial "is necessary for the protection of investors, the public
interest and to maintain fair and orderly markets."17
The preponderance of the record supports the facts on which FINRA based its finding of
a deficiency under the first step of the Rule 6490(d)(3) analysis. Among other things, a request
is deficient if FINRA has "actual knowledge that the issuer, . . . officers, . . . or other persons
connected to the issuer . . . are the subject of a . . . settled . . . civil . . . action related to fraud or
securities laws violations."18 The record reflects that FINRA had actual knowledge about the
Civil Action while considering AutoChina's requests. AutoChina disclosed the existence of the
Civil Action to FINRA on its initial request that FINRA process a stock split, and FINRA
received additional information about the Civil Action during its review of that request. Because
the Civil Action named AutoChina, among others, as a defendant and alleged that AutoChina
had violated the federal securities laws, AutoChina's request was deficient under Rule
6490(d)(3)(3).19 Therefore, we sustain FINRA's finding of a deficiency under Rule
6490(d)(3)(3). FINRA need not revisit this finding on remand, and indeed AutoChina does not
dispute that its request was deficient under the first step of the analysis.
However, FINRA's public interest analysis relied on facts not in the record.20 FINRA
emphasized in its decision that AutoChina's failure to address the alleged continued employment
17

(citations omitted). See also Positron Corp., 2015 WL 470454, at *6 (setting forth and applying
two-step analysis that FINRA must conduct under FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3) in determining
whether to process a Company-Related Action request).
18

FINRA Rule 6490(d)(3)(3).

19

AutoChina does not dispute that its request was deficient under the first step of the
analysis pursuant to Rule 6490(d)(3)(3).
20

Certain evidence that FINRA cited in its public interest analysis is supported by the
record, but FINRA did not find this evidence to be independently dispositive of whether a denial
of the request was in the public interest. For example, evidence clearly establishes that
AutoChina consented to a final judgment in the Civil Action and that AutoChina paid the $4.35
million civil penalty in 2014. The record contains copies of the final judgments as to the two
defendants who settled and the Commission's litigation release announcing the entry of these
final judgments. The record also contains a copy of the Complaint, providing a basis for findings
as to the allegations it contains. See, e.g., mPhase Techs., Inc., 2015 WL 412910, at *6-7
(continued . . .)

7
or affiliation of the AutoChina Defendants "weighed heavily" in its determination to deny the
request for the name change. FINRA found that the AutoChina Defendants (other than Yan) are
still employed by or affiliated with AutoChina. We found no evidence that supports this finding,
and FINRA fails to identify the evidence on which it relied in determining that the defendants are
still employed by or affiliated with AutoChina.21 Other evidence is to the contrary. AutoChina
asserted before the Subcommittee that "the other defendants to the [Civil Action] are not
employed by the Company (and were not so employed at the time of the Civil Action)."22
In light of the lack of record evidence that supports the finding of employment or
affiliation of the AutoChina Defendants (other than Yan), and because that finding "weighed
heavily" in FINRA's decision, we find that it is appropriate to remand this matter to FINRA.23
On remand, FINRA should determine whether the AutoChina Defendants (other than
Yan) are employed by or affiliated with the Company. In the course of making such findings,
FINRA should consider providing the Company with an opportunity to introduce additional
(. . . continued)
(holding that FINRA could consider the underlying findings in a settlement order that were
neither admitted nor denied in making its public interest determination under Rule 6490, where
FINRA gave the applicant the opportunity to dispute the relevance of the settlement to the
Company-Related Action Request, and where FINRA "considered a number of factors in
addition to the settlement").
21

FINRA also found that "the Commission's investigation, which led to the filing of the
federal civil action, initially focused on the conduct of Li and AutoChina's current Chief
Financial Officer." We have not located, and FINRA has not cited, any record evidence in
support of this finding.
22

AutoChina attached to its brief on appeal what appears to be a chain of e-mails dating
from March 12, 2015 to June 3, 2015, between "OTC Corporate Actions" at finra.org and
counsel for AutoChina, in which AutoChina represented, on June 3, 2015, "Except for Hui Kai
Yan, who was employed as the Secretary and a Director of AutoChina during the time of the
SEC complaint, no other person named as a defendant in the complaint was a director, officer or
employee of AutoChina or had any other affiliation with AutoChina during the time of the SEC
complaint." This e-mail string, which we have reviewed as part of our consideration of the
Company's appeal, should have been certified as part of the record, in accordance with Rule of
Practice 420(d) (requiring the self-regulatory organization whose action is the subject of an
application for Commission review to "certify and file with the Commission one copy of the
record upon which the action complained of was taken"). AutoChina asserts, without
contradiction by FINRA, that the appendices attached to its brief "all were reviewed by or
available to the UPCC Subcommittee, but were not included in FINRA's certified record on
appeal."
23

In its brief on appeal, FINRA argues that the defendants "were connected to the Company
for purposes of FINRA's review under Rule 6490." But FINRA's public interest determination
was not based on whether certain defendants in the Civil Action were "connected to" AutoChina.
Instead, FINRA looked to whether those defendants were employed by or affiliated with
AutoChina.

8
evidence to resolve this issue. If the defendants are not employed by or affiliated with
AutoChina, FINRA should determine whether, in light of the deficiency of the Company's
request, a denial of the request is in the public interest. FINRA also should ensure that the record
contains all of the evidence upon which its action is taken.24
An appropriate order will issue.25

Because the issues have been thoroughly briefed and can be adequately determined on
the basis of the record filed by the parties, Applicant's request for oral argument is denied. Rule

on the "papers filed by the parties" unless the "decisional process would be significantly aided by
