In the Matter of
STAY ORDER
NICHOLAS ROWE

On January 25, 2016, the parties jointly moved to stay this proceeding on the basis that
the Division of Enforcement received a scanned copy of an executed offer of settlement from
Respondent Nicholas Rowe, which the parties represent is an agreement on all major terms.
The motion is GRANTED and this proceeding is again STAYED, subject to compliance
with Rule of Practice 161(c)(2). See 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2). Subject to Commission
approval of the settlement, Rowe’s motion to compel certain parties to clarify documents,
Rowe’s motion to compel production of documents designated as privileged by the New
Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation, and the parties’ joint motion to introduce prior
sworn testimony are MOOT.
In light of the stay, the prehearing conference scheduled for January 29, 2016, and the
hearing scheduled to commence on February 1, 2016, are CANCELED.
