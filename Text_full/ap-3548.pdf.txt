In the Matter of
DC BRANDS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE,
POSTPONING HEARING AND
SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On January 11, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings. A hearing is scheduled to commence on February 8, 2016.
On January 22, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondent was served with the OIP on January 14, 2016, in accordance with
Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Because service was made by mail,
Respondent’s answer to the OIP was due January 27, 2016. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.160(b), .220(b). To date, Respondent has not answered the OIP. Additionally, on
January 22, 2016, the Division filed a motion to convert the hearing to a prehearing conference.
I ORDER that Respondent shall SHOW CAUSE by February 8, 2016, why this
proceeding should not be determined against it due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise
defend this proceeding. I FURTHER ORDER that the hearing scheduled for February 8, 2016,
is POSTPONED, and a telephonic prehearing conference shall be held on February 9, 2016, at
3:00 p.m. EST.
If Respondent fails to respond to this order or attend the prehearing conference, it will be
deemed to be in default, the proceeding will be determined against it, and the registration of its
securities will be revoked. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f).
