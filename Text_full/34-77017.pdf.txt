SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
AND SECTION 203(f) OF THE
INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
JASON BO-ALAN BECKMAN
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Section 203(f) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Jason Bo-Alan Beckman (“Respondent” or
“Beckman”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
RESPONDENT
1.
Beckman, age 46, is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence arising from his
conviction for mail fraud and wire fraud. Beckman was the principal owner and manager of The
Oxford Private Client Group LLC (“Oxford PCG”), an investment adviser registered with the
Commission. From 1990 until 2009, Beckman was also a registered representative associated with
several broker-dealers registered with the Commission.

ENTRY OF THE INJUNCTION
2.
On January 12, 2016, a final judgment was entered against Beckman, permanently
enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933
(“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections
206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, in the civil action entitled Securities and Exchange
Commission v. Jason Bo-Alan Beckman, et al., Civil Action Number 11-CV-574, in the United
States District Court for the District of Minnesota.
3.
The Commission’s complaint alleged the following facts: Beckman and Oxford
PCG raised at least $47.3 million from at least 143 investors from August 2006 to July 2009
through a fraudulent, unregistered offering of investments in a purported foreign currency trading
venture (the “Currency Program”), which raised a total of at least $194 million from close to 1,000
victims. Many of the victims were investment advisory clients of Beckman’s firm, Oxford PCG.
Beckman told investors that each investor’s money would be invested in the Currency Program,
their money would be held in a segregated account, there was little or no risk to their money, they
would receive guaranteed returns ranging from 10.5% to 12% per year, and they could withdraw
their money at any time. These representations were false. The investors solicited by Beckman
and Oxford PCG suffered losses of at least $39.1 million from their investments in the Currency
Program. None of the funds was ever placed in segregated accounts at banks or foreign currency
trading firms. A significant portion of the investors’ funds were never invested but instead were
used to fund purported payments of interest and principal to other investors and diverted to
Beckman and others’ personal accounts. Beckman received approximately $7.7 million of
investor funds.
CRIMINAL CONVICTION
4.
On July, 19, 2011, Beckman was indicted for his role in the offering fraud that led
to the SEC civil action. United States v. Beckman, et al., 11-cr-228 (D. Minnesota). A Second
Superseding Indictment was filed against him on February 2, 2012. The Second Superseding
Indictment charged Beckman with fraudulently soliciting investors for the foreign currency trading
program. Specifically, the Second Superseding Indictment alleged that Beckman falsely
represented to investors that the currency trading program: earned double-digit returns; was so safe
that investors could not lose their principal; and, that individual investors’ funds would not be
commingled. On July 12, 2012, a federal jury found Beckman guilty of mail and wire fraud based
on the same misconduct that underlay the Commission’s action. On January 14, 2013, Beckman
was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $155,359,411.77 in restitution. On May
12, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed Beckman’s conviction
and sentence. On November 10, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Beckman’s
petition for a writ of certiorari.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
2

necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220 of
the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as provided
by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial decision
no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related proceeding
will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in
proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within the meaning
of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of
Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
