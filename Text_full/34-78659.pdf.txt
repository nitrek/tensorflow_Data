NOTICE OF PROPOSED
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans
(“Rules”), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the
Commission a proposed plan of distribution (the “Plan of Distribution” or “Plan”) for the
distribution of monies paid in the above-captioned matter.
On October 19, 2011, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-And-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and Desist Orders (“Order”)1 against Credit Suisse
Alternative Capital, LLC (f/k/a Credit Suisse Alternative Capital, Inc.) (“CSAC”), Credit Suisse
Asset Management, LLC (“CSAM”), and Samir H. Bhatt (“Bhatt”) (collectively, “Respondents”)
for violating various provisions of the federal securities laws. As set forth in the Order, CSAC, a
registered representative, and Bhatt, the portfolio manager at CSAC, prepared the marketing
materials for a largely synthetic collateralized debt obligation (“CDO”) known as Class V III that
was structured and marketed by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“CGMI”). The marketing
materials contained misrepresentations and omissions that defrauded investors. The
Commission’s Order held CSAC and CSAM jointly and severally liable for a total of $2,500,000
in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty, and Bhatt liable for a $50,000
civil money penalty. The Respondents made the payments as required by the Order.

Fund has been deposited in an interest-bearing account at the United States Department of
Treasury.

201.1102(a), to the court registry account established in the related Commission action, SEC v.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Case No. 11-cv-7387 (S.D.N.Y.) (“CGMI Action”), to be
combined with the CGMI Action’s distribution fund of approximately $285,000,000 for

action.
