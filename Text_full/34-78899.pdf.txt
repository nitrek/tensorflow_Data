OPINION AND ORDER DISMISSING
APPLICATION FOR REVIEW

LI-LIN HSU
For Review of Action Taken by
FINRA

Appeal filed:
Last brief received:

July 1, 2016
August 8, 2016

FINRA requests that we dismiss Li-Lin Hsu’s application for review of its action barring
her from association with any FINRA member firm in any capacity.1 Hsu, an individual
formerly associated with a FINRA member, was barred for failing to provide information in
connection with a FINRA investigation. Because we agree with FINRA that Hsu failed to
exhaust her administrative remedies, we grant its motion to dismiss her application for review.
Background
On April 9, 2015, FINRA informed Hsu that it was conducting an inquiry with respect to
her suspension and termination from Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (“Ameriprise”).
FINRA explained that the purpose of its inquiry was to determine whether violations of the
federal securities laws or FINRA, NASD, NYSE, or MSRB rules had occurred. It requested that
Hsu provide certain documents and information pursuant to FINRA Rule 8210.2

Hsu has not filed an opposition to FINRA’s motion.

See FINRA Rule 8210(a) (stating that “FINRA staff shall have the right” to require a
“person associated with a member” to provide specified testimony, information, or documents).

2
Hsu responded to the requests, and FINRA requested additional documents from her on
July 31, 2015, and August 11, 2015. After Hsu failed to respond to those requests, FINRA
suspended her pursuant to FINRA Rule 9552.3 Hsu eventually provided the requested
information, and FINRA terminated the suspension in December 2015.
On January 6, 2016, FINRA requested that Hsu provide ten additional categories of
documents and information by January 13, 2016, and asked her to arrange a time to speak with
its assigned investigator. Hsu did not respond to these requests or to the investigator’s
subsequent calls and emails. On January 14, 2016, FINRA informed Hsu that she had violated
Rule 8210 because she had failed to respond to its requests, and FINRA made a second request
that Hsu provide the documents and information sought in the January 6 letter by January 22,
2016. FINRA also informed Hsu that if she failed to do so, she would be subject to the
institution of an expedited or formal disciplinary proceeding that could lead to sanctions,
including a bar from the securities industry. Hsu did not respond.
On February 29, 2016, FINRA sent Hsu a notice of suspension letter pursuant to Rule
9552. The letter informed her that she would be suspended from association with any FINRA
member in any capacity on March 24, 2016, unless she complied with FINRA’s January 6 and
14, 2016 requests for information. The letter also apprised Hsu that she could stay the
suspension before it took effect by requesting a hearing pursuant to FINRA Rule 9552(e).4
FINRA further advised Hsu that if she were suspended, she could file with the head of FINRA
Enforcement a written request for termination of the suspension on the grounds that she had fully
complied with the prior requests. Finally, the letter notified Hsu that if she were suspended and
failed to request termination of the suspension within three months of the notice of suspension,
i.e., by June 1, 2016, she would be barred automatically pursuant to FINRA Rule 9552(h).5
Hsu failed to produce any of the requested documents or information and did not request
a hearing. On March 24, 2016, FINRA notified Hsu that she had been suspended from
association with any FINRA member. FINRA reminded her that she would be barred if she did
not request termination of the suspension by June 1, 2016.
Hsu did not request termination of the suspension (or comply with FINRA’s requests).
Instead, she sent FINRA an email on June 1, 2016, requesting that FINRA extend her
compliance deadline. Hsu asserted that she had been out of the country receiving treatment for

provide information requested pursuant to FINRA rules then FINRA staff may provide written
notice to such person “specifying the nature of the failure and stating that the failure to take
corrective action within 21 days after service of the notice will result in suspension of
membership or of association of the person with any member”).

injuries following an August 3, 2015 car accident and that her attorney had advised her not to
respond to the requests without his supervision.
On June 1, 2016, FINRA notified Hsu by email that her request for an extension had been
reviewed and denied. FINRA emphasized that it had commenced the Rule 9552 proceeding on
February 29, 2016, and had apprised Hsu of the necessity of responding to its requests—and the
repercussions for failing to do so—through its previous correspondence.
Also on June 1, 2016, FINRA notified Hsu that she had been barred from associating
with any FINRA member in any capacity in accordance with Rule 9552(h) and the notice of
suspension and suspension from association letters. On July 1, 2016, Hsu timely appealed the
bar.
Analysis
We dismiss Hsu’s application because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies
before FINRA. “[W]e will not consider an application for review if that applicant failed to
exhaust FINRA’s procedures for contesting the sanction at issue.”6 We have explained that it is
“clearly proper to require that a statutory right to review be exercised in an orderly fashion, and
to specify procedural steps which must be observed as a condition to securing review.”7
Hsu does not dispute that she did not follow these procedural steps. She failed to “avail
herself of FINRA’s administrative process through [1] taking corrective action” by producing the
information FINRA requested, “[2] requesting a hearing in response to the notice of suspension,
or [3] filing for termination of the suspension.”8 Because Hsu did none of these things, she
failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.9
In her application for review, Hsu argues that FINRA should have granted her request for
an extension of time to respond to its suspension notice. But a request for an extension of time to
respond to a Rule 9552 notice does not satisfy the obligation to exhaust administrative remedies
before FINRA. An extension request does not demonstrate compliance with Rule 8210 requests,
request a hearing, or seek termination of a suspension on the grounds of full compliance. Put
differently, simply contacting FINRA after receiving a notice under Rule 9552 does not
constitute exhaustion. Accordingly, we have dismissed applications for review where, although

an applicant contacted FINRA, she failed to take the necessary steps required to exhaust her
remedies.10
Dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies may not be appropriate if an
applicant can establish that FINRA abused its discretion in denying a request for an extension of
time. But where FINRA properly denies an extension request, dismissal is appropriate. In other
words, an extension request that is properly denied does not excuse an applicant’s failure to
exhaust.11
We review FINRA’s denial of Hsu’s request pursuant to an abuse of discretion
standard.12 Hsu sought an extension of time on two bases. We conclude FINRA did not abuse
its discretion by denying her request.
First, Hsu asserted to FINRA that she needed an extension because she was out of the
country receiving medical treatment for injuries suffered in an August 2015 car accident in
California. But Hsu did not substantiate her claimed physical injuries by providing medical
records or establish that they prevented her from responding to FINRA’s January 2016 requests
by June 1, 2016.13 Hsu’s car accident did not prevent her from traveling internationally or

(Sept. 16, 2011) (dismissing application for review on exhaustion grounds where applicant
produced no documents, sought hearing after deadline to do so, and, instead of requesting
termination of suspension on grounds of full compliance, merely promised to be in full
compliance and punctual going forward); Gary A. Fox, Exchange Act Release No. 46511, 2002

available administrative remedies” before FINRA); Lee Gura, Exchange Act Release No. 50570,

providing information in late 2015 in response to other FINRA requests. Hsu also represents that
she answered a Commission subpoena at the Los Angeles regional office on May 26, 2016, i.e.,
nearly a week before the deadline to respond to FINRA’s requests, and that she did so
completely. Hsu does not establish that she could not also have complied with FINRA’s
requests.
Second, Hsu asserted that she needed an extension because her attorney advised her not
to disclose any information to FINRA without his supervision since FINRA might share it with
Ameriprise and Ameriprise had pursued litigation against her. This suggests that Hsu did not
respond to FINRA’s Rule 9552 notice for reasons other than her claimed injuries, medical
treatment, and travel. Moreover, a recipient of a Rule 8210 request cannot avoid compliance
based on the advice of counsel14 or because of implications for other litigation.15 In any event,
Hsu does not allege that her attorney advised her that she was not required to respond to
FINRA’s requests; rather, Hsu states that her attorney informed her that responding to the
requests might have collateral consequences in her litigation with Ameriprise and that she should
coordinate with him before doing so. Hsu also presents no evidence that she engaged in such
coordination with her attorney.16 She simply did not answer the requests, and waited until the
day she would be barred automatically to request an extension of her compliance deadline. On
these facts, we find that FINRA properly acted within its broad discretion in denying Hsu’s
request for an extension of time.

at *5 (Jan. 28, 2000) (“Reliance on counsel, however, does not excuse Chiulli from his

43363, 2000 WL 1423640, at *3 (Sept. 19, 2000) (“Escott-Russell was not relieved of her

would cooperate fully with NASD information request once any associated litigation was
resolved because “the possibility of litigation in connection with the underlying transaction
provided no excuse” for failure to comply with Rule 8210).
16

Hsu’s attorney never entered an appearance in the Rule 9552 proceeding or contacted
FINRA.

6
We thus conclude that there is no basis to excuse Hsu’s failure to exhaust her
administrative remedies before FINRA.
Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, IT IS ORDERED that Li-Lin Hsu’s
application for review is DISMISSED.
By the Commission.
