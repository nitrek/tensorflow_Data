UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
October 28, 2016

In the Matter of
InterAmerican Gaming, Inc., and
Spot Mobile International Ltd.,
ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING
File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of InterAmerican Gaming, Inc.
(CIK No. 1125053), a revoked Nevada corporation with its principal place of business
listed as Toronto, Ontario, Canada with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker
symbol IAGM, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended
September 30, 2012. On January 23, 2013, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division
of Corporation Finance to InterAmerican Gaming, Inc. requesting compliance with its
periodic filing obligations, and by letter of February 7, 2013, InterAmerican Gaming,
Inc.â€™s counsel acknowledged receipt of the delinquency letter, but InterAmerican
Gaming, Inc. has failed to cure its delinquencies in response to the delinquency letter.
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Spot Mobile International

Ltd. (CIK No. 913659), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business listed
as North York, Ontario, Canada with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol
RPID, because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended October 31,
2011. On April 5, 2016, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation
Finance to Spot Mobile International Ltd. requesting compliance with its periodic filing
obligations, but Spot Mobile International Ltd. did not receive the delinquency letter due
to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by
Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of
EDGAR Filer Manual).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed companies is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on October 28, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EST on November
10, 2016.
By the Commission.

Secretary
