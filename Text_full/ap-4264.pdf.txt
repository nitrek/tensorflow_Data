authenticity, or admissibility into evidence of documents.

December 7, 2016:

Because the deadline for filing motions in limine passed before the case was enjoined, if a party
wishes to file a motion in limine with respect to a previously identified witness or exhibit, the
party should seek leave to do so, showing good cause for the failure to have filed a timely
motion. See Charles L. Hill, Jr., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2722, 2015 SEC LEXIS
2098 (May 26, 2015) (motions in limine and any objections to exhibits and witnesses due June 2,
2015).
