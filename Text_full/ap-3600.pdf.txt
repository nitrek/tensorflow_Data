In the Matter of

ORDER SETTING SUMMARY
DISPOSITION SCHEDULE

PAUL D. CRAWFORD

On January 11, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings against Respondent Paul D. Crawford, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
On February 10, 2016, the parties submitted a joint prehearing conference statement. The
statement includes a proposed schedule with prehearing deadlines. I adopt the parties’ proposed
schedule as to summary disposition briefing, as follows:
February 26, 2016:

Motions for summary disposition are due.

March 25, 2016:

Oppositions are due.

April 8, 2016:

Replies are due.

Although Respondent does not intend at this time to file a cross-motion for summary
disposition, if he elects to do so, he must follow the same schedule noted above. If this
proceeding is not resolved by summary disposition, I will set a telephonic prehearing conference
to discuss a prehearing schedule.
Electronic courtesy copies of the parties’ submissions should be emailed to ALJ@sec.gov
in PDF text-searchable format. Electronic copies of exhibits should not be combined into a
single PDF file, but sent as separate attachments.
SO ORDERED.
