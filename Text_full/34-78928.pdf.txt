The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of the foregoing
companies because of questions regarding the adequacy and accuracy of information
about the companies. The order was entered pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
The Commission cautions brokers, dealers, shareholders, and prospective purchasers that
they should carefully consider the foregoing information along with all other currently
available information and any information subsequently issued by these companies.
Brokers and dealers should be alert to the fact that, pursuant to Rule 15c2-11 under the
Exchange Act, at the termination of the trading suspensions, no quotation may be entered
relating to the securities of the subject companies unless and until they have strictly
complied with all of the provisions of the rule. If any broker or dealer is uncertain as to
what is required by the rule, it should refrain from entering quotations relating to the
securities of these companies that have been subject to trading suspensions until such
time as it has familiarized itself with the rule and is certain that all of its provisions have
been met. Any broker or dealer with questions regarding the rule should contact the staff
in the Division of Trading and Markets, Office of Interpretation and Guidance, at (202)
551-5777. If any broker or dealer enters any quotation that is in violation of the rule, the
Commission will consider the need for prompt enforcement action.
If any broker, dealer or other person has any information that may relate to this matter,
they should immediately contact Elisha L. Frank, Assistant Regional Director, or Jason
R. Berkowitz, Assistant Regional Director, Miami Regional Office of the Securities and
Exchange Commission at (305) 982-6300, or Michael D. Paley, Assistant Regional
