On March 29, 2016, Administrative Law Judge Carol Fox Foelak issued an Initial Decision
with respect to Brian J. Ourand. The Initial Decision stated, among other things, that “a party
may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of the

Decision.
At this time, the Commission requests the views of the parties as to whether Ourand’s
appeal should be dismissed as untimely pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 410(b).
It is ORDERED that the parties file briefs on this issue, not to exceed five pages, by June 6,
2016. Responses to the initial briefs, not to exceed three pages, may be filed by June 13, 2016,
and no further briefs may be filed without seeking leave from the Commission.
