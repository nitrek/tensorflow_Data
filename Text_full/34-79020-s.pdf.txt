SEC Suspends Three Former CPAs With Felony Convictions
September 30, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the permanent
suspensions of three former CPAs with felony convictions – Dennis Duban of Malibu, California,
Steven M. Brazile of St. Louis, Missouri and Alan Ritter of North Miami Beach, Florida.
Duban was a CPA licensed in California, Washington, Hawaii and New York. He was also the sole
owner of a state-registered advisory firm. After being charged with multiple criminal counts
including two counts of conspiracy to defraud in a criminal action, Duban falsely certified in Forms
ADV that he had not been charged with any felony in the past ten years. Duban ultimately pleaded
guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and one count of willfully
aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false personal income tax return.
Brazile was a CPA licensed in Texas. According to a criminal court filing, Brazile embezzled
money from his corporate employer. He pleaded guilty to one count of interstate transportation of
a security obtained by fraud.
Ritter was a CPA licensed in New York. He was accused in a criminal court filing of engaging in
a Ponzi scheme. He pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud.
Duban, Brazile and Ritter are suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as
accountants, which includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits of public
companies. In addition, Durban agreed to a permanent industry bar.
SEC enforcement staff used surveillance techniques to identify the criminal convictions and CPA
designations of these individuals.
The investigations were conducted by Jen Peltz and supervised by Paul Montoya of the SEC’s
Chicago Regional Office.
