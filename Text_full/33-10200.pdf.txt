SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
[Release Nos. 33-10200; 34-78726 / August 30, 2016]
Order Making Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Adjustments to Registration Fee Rates
I.

Background
The Commission collects fees under various provisions of the securities laws.

Section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) requires the Commission to
collect fees from issuers on the registration of securities. 1 Section 13(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) requires the Commission to collect fees on
specified repurchases of securities. 2 Section 14(g) of the Exchange Act requires the
Commission to collect fees on specified proxy solicitations and statements in corporate
control transactions. 3 These provisions require the Commission to make annual
adjustments to the applicable fee rates.
II.

Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Adjustment to Fee Rates
Section 6(b)(2) of the Securities Act requires the Commission to make an annual

adjustment to the fee rate applicable under Section 6(b). 4 The annual adjustment to the
fee rate under Section 6(b) of the Securities Act also sets the annual adjustment to the fee
rates under Sections 13(e) and 14(g) of the Exchange Act. 5

3

15 U.S.C. 78n(g).

4

15 U.S.C. 77f(b)(2). The annual adjustments are designed to adjust the fee rate in a given fiscal
year so that, when applied to the aggregate maximum offering price at which securities are
proposed to be offered for the fiscal year, it is reasonably likely to produce total fee collections
under Section 6(b) equal to the “target fee collection amount” specified in Section 6(b)(6)(A) for
that fiscal year.

15 U.S.C. 78m(e)(4) and 15 U.S.C. 78n(g)(4).

Section 6(b)(2) sets forth the method for determining the annual adjustment to the
fee rate under Section 6(b) for fiscal year 2017. Specifically, the Commission must
adjust the fee rate under Section 6(b) to a “rate that, when applied to the baseline estimate
of the aggregate maximum offering prices for [fiscal year 2017], is reasonably likely to
produce aggregate fee collections under [Section 6(b)] that are equal to the target fee
collection amount for [fiscal year 2017].” That is, the adjusted rate is determined by
dividing the “target fee collection amount” for fiscal year 2017 by the “baseline estimate
of the aggregate maximum offering prices” for fiscal year 2017.
Section 6(b)(6)(A) specifies that the “target fee collection amount” for fiscal year
2017 is $585,000,000. Section 6(b)(6)(B) defines the “baseline estimate of the aggregate
maximum offering prices” for fiscal year 2017 as “the baseline estimate of the aggregate
maximum offering price at which securities are proposed to be offered pursuant to
registration statements filed with the Commission during [fiscal year 2017] as determined
by the Commission, after consultation with the Congressional Budget Office and the
Office of Management and Budget . . . .”
To make the baseline estimate of the aggregate maximum offering price for fiscal
year 2017, the Commission is using a methodology that has been used in prior fiscal
years and that was developed in consultation with the Congressional Budget Office
(“CBO”) and Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”). 6 Using this methodology,
the Commission determines the “baseline estimate of the aggregate maximum offering

Appendix A explains how we determined the “baseline estimate of the aggregate maximum
offering price” for fiscal year 2017 using our methodology, and then shows the arithmetical
process of calculating the fiscal year 2017 annual adjustment based on that estimate. The
appendix includes the data used by the Commission in making its “baseline estimate of the
aggregate maximum offering price” for fiscal year 2017.

price” for fiscal year 2017 to be $5,047,682,013,502. Based on this estimate, the
Commission calculates the fee rate for fiscal 2017 to be $115.90 per million. This
adjusted fee rate applies to Section 6(b) of the Securities Act, as well as to Sections 13(e)
and 14(g) of the Exchange Act.
III.

Effective Dates of the Annual Adjustments
The fiscal year 2017 annual adjustments to the fee rates applicable under Section

6(b) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(e) and 14(g) of the Exchange Act will be
effective on October 1, 2016. 7
IV.

Conclusion
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(e) and

14(g) of the Exchange Act, 8
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the fee rates applicable under Section 6(b) of the
Securities Act and Sections 13(e) and 14(g) of the Exchange Act shall be $115.90 per
million effective on October 1, 2016.

APPENDIX A
Congress has established a target amount of monies to be collected from fees
charged to issuers based on the value of their registrations. This appendix provides the
formula for determining such fees, which the Commission adjusts annually. Congress
has mandated that the Commission determine these fees based on the “aggregate
maximum offering prices,” which measures the aggregate dollar amount of securities
registered with the Commission over the course of the year. In order to maximize the
likelihood that the amount of monies targeted by Congress will be collected, the fee rate
must be set to reflect projected aggregate maximum offering prices. As a percentage, the
fee rate equals the ratio of the target amounts of monies to the projected aggregate
maximum offering prices.
For 2017, the Commission has estimated the aggregate maximum offering prices
by projecting forward the trend established in the previous decade. More specifically, an
ARIMA model was used to forecast the value of the aggregate maximum offering prices
for months subsequent to July 2016, the last month for which the Commission has data
on the aggregate maximum offering prices.
The following sections describe this process in detail.
A. Baseline estimate of the aggregate maximum offering prices for fiscal year 2017.
First, calculate the aggregate maximum offering prices (AMOP) for each month
in the sample (July 2006 - July 2016). Next, calculate the percentage change in the
AMOP from month to month.

4

Model the monthly percentage change in AMOP as a first order moving average
process. The moving average approach allows one to model the effect that an
exceptionally high (or low) observation of AMOP tends to be followed by a more
“typical” value of AMOP.
Use the estimated moving average model to forecast the monthly percent change
in AMOP. These percent changes can then be applied to obtain forecasts of the total
dollar value of registrations. The following is a more formal (mathematical) description
of the procedure:
1. Begin with the monthly data for AMOP. The sample spans ten years, from July 2006
to July 2016.
2. Divide each month’s AMOP (column C) by the number of trading days in that month
(column B) to obtain the average daily AMOP (AAMOP, column D).
3. For each month t, the natural logarithm of AAMOP is reported in column E.
4. Calculate the change in log(AAMOP) from the previous month as
∆t = log (AAMOPt) – log(AAMOPt-1). This approximates the percentage change.
5. Estimate the first order moving average model ∆t = α + βet-1 + et, where et denotes the
forecast error for month t. The forecast error is simply the difference between the
one-month ahead forecast and the actual realization of ∆t. The forecast error is
expressed as et = ∆t – α – βet-1. The model can be estimated using standard
commercially available software. Using least squares, the estimated parameter values
are α = 0.002807020 and β = -0.82994.

5

6. For the month of August 2016 forecast ∆t = 8/16 = α + βet = 7/16. For all subsequent
months, forecast ∆t = α.
7. Calculate forecasts of log(AAMOP). For example, the forecast of log(AAMOP) for
October 2016 is given by FLAAMOP t = 10/16 = log(AAMOP t = 7/16) + ∆ t = 8/16 +∆ t = 9/16
+ ∆ t = 10/16.
8. Under the assumption that et is normally distributed, the n-step ahead forecast of
AAMOP is given by exp(FLAAMOPt + σn2/2), where σn denotes the standard error
of the n-step ahead forecast.
9. For October 2016, this gives a forecast AAMOP of $19.614 billion (Column I), and a
forecast AMOP of $411.9 billion (Column J).
10. Iterate this process through September 2017 to obtain a baseline estimate of the
aggregate maximum offering prices for fiscal year 2017 of $5,047,682,013,502.

B. Using the forecasts from A to calculate the new fee rate.
1. Using the data from Table A, estimate the aggregate maximum offering prices
between 10/01/16 and 9/30/17 to be $5,047,682,013,502.
2. The rate necessary to collect the target $585,000,000 in fee revenues set by Congress
is then calculated as: $585,000,000 ÷ $5,047,682,013,502 = 0.000115895.
3. Round the result to the seventh decimal point, yielding a rate of 0.0001159 (or
$115.90 per million).
