In the Matter of
DONALD F. (“JAY”) LATHEN, JR.,
ORDER DENYING LEAVE FOR
EDEN ARC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, and SUMMARY DISPOSITION
EDEN ARC CAPITAL ADVISORS, LLC

Respondents have asked for leave to move for summary disposition. The Division of
Enforcement opposes Respondents’ motion. Because Respondents have not shown a likelihood
that they will be able to demonstrate the absence of a “genuine issue with regard to any material
fact,” 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b), their motion is denied.
Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding in August 2016.
The order instituting proceedings (OIP) alleges the following. Respondent Donald F. Lathen, Jr.,
owns, controls, and occupies all corporate offices of Respondent Eden Arc Capital Management,
LLC (the Adviser). OIP ¶ 3. The Adviser allegedly serves as the investment adviser to Eden
Arc Capital Partners, LP (the Fund). Id. ¶ 4. Respondent Eden Arc Capital Advisors, LLC (the
General Partner), serves as the general partner to the Fund. Id. ¶ 5.
Briefly stated, the Division alleges that Respondents defrauded issuers of bonds and
certificates of deposit. Lathen allegedly identified “terminally ill individuals,” referred to as
“Participants,” who, for $10,000 were willing to become joint owners with Lathen or his relative
of brokerage accounts. OIP ¶¶ 12, 19, 20, 23-24. Using money supplied by the Fund, Lathen
and each Participant would purchase, at a discount to par, securities containing a survivor option.
Id. ¶¶ 9-10, 31-32. On the death of the Participant, Lathen, as the joint account survivor,
exercised the option and sold the security back to the issuer at par plus interest. Id. ¶¶ 9, 11,
36-37.
Respondents allegedly engaged in fraud when Lathen opened the accounts (the opening
fraud) and when he exercised the options (the exercising fraud). The opening fraud allegedly
occurred because although the forms used to open the accounts listed Lathen and the Participants
as the joint owners, they were actually nominees of the Fund. OIP ¶¶ 24-25. The Fund could

not have been a joint owner because corporate entities do not have survivorship rights. Id. ¶ 30.
The exercising fraud allegedly occurred when Lathen exercised the survivor option, falsely
claiming to be the surviving joint owner and not disclosing the General Partner’s or the
Adviser’s “relationship to the investments” or the nature of their involvement with the
investments.1 Id. ¶¶ 37-38.
After Respondents answered the OIP, they asked for leave to move for summary
disposition.2 They agree that the Fund financed the “brokerage accounts that Mr. Lathen and
Participants had opened together.” Mot. at 1. They also agree that all the accounts “contained
. . . a ‘survivor’s option,’” which Lathen exercised on the death of each Participant. Id. at 2.
Respondents contend that in exercising the option, Lathen made two “true and accurate”
representations: “(1) the Participant was a ‘joint owner’ or ‘joint and beneficial owner’ on the
. . . account . . . ; and (2) he was the surviving joint owner.” Id.
Respondents contend that each account was a valid joint tenancy with rights of
survivorship because the accounts were opened “using the relevant survivorship language.” Mot.
at 3. According to Respondents, as a matter of New York law, a joint tenancy in an account “is
presumed valid and legally effective.” Id. They assert that “any party challenging the validity of
a [joint tenancy with rights of survivorship] must establish by ‘clear and convincing’ evidence
that it is not valid.” Id. And the only bases for invalidating a joint tenancy “are fraud, undue
influence, lack of capacity or a determination that the joint tenancy is a so-called ‘convenience
account.’” Id. (citing In re Estate of Grancaric, 936 N.Y.S. 2d 723, 726 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012)).
Respondents assert that Lathen and the Participants established valid joint tenancies and
nothing suggests a basis to reach any other conclusion. Mot. at 4. They argue that because each
joint tenancy was valid, Lathen was the “true” surviving joint tenant. Id. His assertions to the
issuers were therefore “true and accurate.” Id. Respondents assert that they will be entitled to
summary disposition because the Division has failed to “plead facts sufficient to overcome the
statutory presumption under New York law that the [joint tenancies with rights of survivorship]
that Mr. Lathen formed with Participants were valid and legally effective and that he was a true
‘survivor.’”3 Id.
Discussion
Commission Rule of Practice 250 governs motions for summary disposition. See 17
C.F.R. § 201.250. The version of Rule 250 applicable to this proceeding provides that an
1

The Division also contends that, because the investments and money in the accounts
actually belonged to the Fund, Respondents are liable for not maintaining the securities and
money in an account in the Fund’s name or in an account that contained only the Fund’s money
and securities. OIP ¶ 73.

Prior to the hearing, a party must seek leave before filing a motion for summary
disposition. 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a).

Respondents also argue that because the money and securities in question did not belong
to the Fund, Respondents did not violate any custody requirements. Mot. at 4-5.

administrative law judge “may grant [a] motion for summary disposition if there is no genuine
issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a summary
disposition as a matter of law.”4 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b). Although Rule 250 provides a
mechanism for seeking summary disposition, summary disposition is disfavored in cases like this
one, in which the Commission has ordered that an initial decision be issued within 300 days of
service of the OIP. Rules of Practice, Exchange Act Release No. 35833, 60 Fed. Reg. 32738,
32768 (June 23, 1995); see Jay T. Comeaux, Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 9633, 2014 WL
4160054, at *4 n.30 (Aug. 21, 2014). Unlike under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, when a
respondent moves for summary disposition in a Commission proceeding, the administrative law
judge must “take[] as true” the facts alleged in the OIP, “except as modified by stipulations or
admissions made by [the Division], by uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noticed
pursuant to Rule 323.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1), (e) (requiring a
party to support an assertion with evidence and providing consequences for the failure to do so).
The procedure contemplated under Rule 250 is thus more limited than that governed by Rule 56.
See 60 Fed. Reg. at 32768 (“[T]he circumstances when summary disposition prior to hearing
could be appropriately sought or granted will be comparatively rare.”). And leave for summary
disposition is inappropriate where “a genuine issue as to material facts clearly exists as to an
issue.” Id. at 32767.
Bearing in mind the Commission’s direction that summary disposition is disfavored and
considering Respondents’ arguments, their request for leave must be denied.
Respondents’ argument is that under New York law, the accounts were presumptively
valid joint tenancies with rights of survivorship and that there is no evidence to overcome that
presumption. Absent such evidence, Respondents assert that it is a fact that Lathen was the true
surviving joint tenant and that he was entitled to exercise the survivor options and receive the
resulting funds. Whether he or the Participants were nominees of the Fund is, in Respondents’
view, irrelevant. See Preh’g Tr. 11-12.
Assuming that Respondents are correct that the only issue is whether Lathen and the
Participants established valid joint tenancies in the accounts—in other words, assuming the
issuers would not have cared that their securities were purchased with capital supplied by the
Fund and that the Participants’ terminal conditions made near-term exercise of the survivor
options likely—Respondents’ motion for leave shows that they will not be able to demonstrate
that material facts are not in dispute.
As Respondents note, in New York the creation of a joint account with rights of
survivorship raises a presumption that the joint tenancy is valid. N.Y. Banking Law § 675(b).
This presumption may be rebutted by “clear and convincing” evidence “sufficient to support an
inference that the joint account had been opened in that form as a matter of convenience only.”
In re Estate of Coddington, 391 N.Y.S.2d 760, 761-62 (N.Y. App. Div. 1977). “In a true joint
account, each party has the right to withdraw one half of the funds during the lifetime of both

The parties previously elected to proceed under the Commission’s pre-amendment Rules
of Practice. See Donald F. (“Jay”) Lathen, Jr., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4149, 2016
SEC LEXIS 3416, at *1 & n.1 (ALJ Sept. 13, 2016).

tenants.” In re Estate of Zecca, 544 N.Y.S.2d 40, 41 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989) (internal citation
omitted). This means that “at the time the account was opened, there must have been a present
gift from the original donor to the cotenant of one half of the account which each could withdraw
unilaterally while both were alive.” Id.; see In re Estate of Stalter, 703 N.Y.S.2d 600, 602 (N.Y.
App. Div. 2000) (“the key underlying issue” is “decedent’s intent at the time that the account . . .
was created”). It is thus “well settled that the presumption” of validity “may be rebutted by
evidence showing” that the funding joint tenant did not “inten[d] . . . [to] confer[] a present
beneficial interest on the” other joint tenant at the time the account was opened. In re Friedman,
478 N.Y.S.2d 695, 696 (N.Y. App. Div. 1984), aff’d, 475 N.E.2d 454 (N.Y. 1984); see
Fischedick v. Heitmann, 699 N.Y.S.2d 508, 509 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999); Cinquemani v.
Cinquemani, 346 N.Y.S.2d 875, 877-78 (N.Y. App. Div. 1973). If such evidence is presented,
the party asserting the existence of the presumption must do more than simply rely on the fact of
the statutory presumption. Phelps v. Kramer, 477 N.Y.S. 2d 743, 745 (N.Y. App. Div. 1984);
see Brezinski v. Brezinski, 463 N.Y.S.2d 975, 977 (N.Y. App. Div. 1983) (explaining that if the
presumption of validity is rebutted, the burden shifts to the joint tenant claiming the
presumption’s benefit to show there was an “inten[t] to make a gift of the funds”).
For purposes of adjudicating Respondents’ motion for summary disposition, I would be
required to accept as true the facts alleged in the OIP. 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). Most relevant to
the issue Respondents pose, the OIP alleges, and Respondents concede, that some Participants
agreed “that they ‘[would] not be permitted to pledge, borrow against, withdraw or exercise any
right of ownership with respect to the Investments or other assets in the Account(s) without the
express written permission of Lathen, which permission may be withheld in Lathen’s sole
discretion.’” OIP ¶ 57 (emphasis added); Answer ¶ 57. This concession suggests that before the
accounts were opened, neither Lathen nor the Participants intended that the Participants would
have unilateral access to funds or securities in the accounts. Under the precedent discussed
above, evidence that some Participants could never unilaterally withdraw funds or securities
from the accounts raises a material factual dispute about whether Lathen and the Participants
entered into a valid joint tenancy in the accounts. See In re Estate of Zecca, 544 N.Y.S.2d at 41.
The OIP also alleges that neither Lathen nor the Participants were the owners of the
accounts. OIP ¶ 25. The Participants neither funded nor paid any costs associated with the
accounts. Id. ¶¶ 33-34. Respondents considered the assets in the accounts to be the Fund’s
assets and the Fund “earn[ed] all income associated with the ownership of the . . . investments in
the . . . accounts.” See id. ¶¶ 43, 49. Finally, Participants do not pay taxes on gains in the
accounts, id. ¶ 52, which raises an inference that the money or securities in the accounts did not
belong to them. These allegations further suggest that no one “inten[ded] . . . [to] confer[] a
beneficial interest” in the accounts on the Participants. Plotnikoff v. Finkelstein, 482 N.Y.S.2d
730, 732 (N.Y. App. Div. 1984). These allegations, which would be taken as true for purposes
of a summary disposition motion, are “sufficient to support an inference that the joint account
had been opened in that form as a matter of convenience only.” In re Estate of Coddington, 391
N.Y.S.2d at 761-62; see Wacikowski v. Wacikowski, 461 N.Y.S.2d 888, 889 (N.Y. App. Div.
1983) (finding the presumption rebutted on the basis of evidence that one joint tenant “always
had exclusive possession of the account passbook” and the other “never made any deposits to or
withdrawals from the account”). Respondents have therefore failed to show a likelihood that
they will be able to demonstrate the absence of a “genuine issue with regard to any material
4

fact.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b). As a result, they have failed to demonstrate that they should be
granted leave to move for summary disposition on this issue. See 60 Fed. Reg. at 32767 (stating
that it is inappropriate to grant leave to move for summary disposition “[w]here a genuine issue
as to material facts clearly exists as to an issue”); cf. Harrington v. Brunson, 12 N.Y.S.3d 696,
698 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015) (finding summary judgment inappropriate where, among other
things, evidence showed “that decedent was the sole depositor of the joint accounts, and that
plaintiff never withdrew funds from the joint accounts during decedent’s lifetime”).
