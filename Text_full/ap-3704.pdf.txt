CONFERENCE

On March 1, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled to commence on March 24, 2016.
On March 14, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP by March 10, 2016, in accordance with
17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii). Because service was made by mail, Respondents’ answers to the
OIP are due by March 23, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). If Respondents
fail to timely file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding, they will be deemed in default, the
proceeding will be determined against them, and the registrations of their securities will be
revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
I ORDER that the March 24, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED, and a telephonic prehearing
conference shall be held on April 25, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. EDT, if the proceeding has not been
resolved by then.
