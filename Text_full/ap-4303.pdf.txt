File No. 3-15619
In the Matter of

ORDER DESIGNATING SETTLEMENT ALJ

JOSEPH P. DOXEY
The parties have filed a joint motion requesting designation of a settlement administrative
law judge. In their motion, the parties have agreed to terms consistent with those outlined in
AirTouch Communications, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2253, 2015 SEC LEXIS 271
(ALJ Jan. 23, 2015).
Based on the parties’ agreement, and for purpose of facilitating settlement discussions
only, this matter is referred to Administrative Law Judge James E. Grimes, who is designated as
the settlement ALJ. By October 31, 2016, each party must separately submit a confidential
settlement statement (CSS) by email only, directly to lindellj@sec.gov. DO NOT SEND
COPIES OF THE CSS TO THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, THE PRESIDING
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE, OTHER COUNSEL/PARTIES, OR THIS OFFICE’S
MAIN EMAIL BOX (alj@sec.gov). Each party’s CSS should do the following:





Describe any settlement offers made and the current status of settlement discussions;
Identify the acceptable range of monetary penalties or remedial actions in valuing the
case for settlement purposes;
Identify additional information or action, if any, required by the party in order to engage
in meaningful settlement negotiations;
Assuming the settlement ALJ’s familiarity with the order instituting proceedings and
answer, describe the factual and legal support for each party’s key claims and defenses.
Factual claims should be supported by reference to evidence (such as a document or what
a witness will testify to), and legal claims by reference to binding or persuasive
authorities. Each party should highlight any weaknesses in its opponent’s case. Each
party is invited to append exhibits to its CSS.

If necessary, on November 3, 2016, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern, the settlement ALJ will
facilitate a confidential settlement conference with the parties by teleconference. The settlement
ALJ will meet with the parties first jointly and then privately as required. The parties’
representatives at the joint confidential settlement conference must bring, or have immediately
available by appropriate means, an individual with settlement authority. Additional discussions
may be scheduled if appropriate. No part of any settlement conference will be transcribed.

The confidential settlement process described above is not intended to supplant the
parties’ independent, good faith efforts to reach a mutually agreeable settlement. If a settlement
is reached, the parties should promptly notify the presiding ALJ with a motion to stay, as the
settlement ALJ will not communicate to the presiding ALJ any information on the status of the
parties’ confidential settlement negotiations.
