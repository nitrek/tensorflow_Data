Basic approach
Basic policy for personnel management

all companies with which we do business. We follow the
Three Principles of Respecting Initiative, Ensuring Fairness
and Encouraging Mutual Trust when managing our human
resources in areas such as recruitment, training, assignment
and utilization, evaluation and treatment. Honda seeks to
create an environment in which each associate’s ambitions
and abilities can be developed, as well as a workplace
where an individual’s potential can be actively exercised.
Under the circumstance that our business activities
expand into various parts of the world, based on the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
international standards, we have established Associate
Relations Policies in March 2012 and apply them to our
daily corporate actions, which put the Three Principles of
Personnel Management into practice.

Managing human resources through thorough
practice of the Three Principles based on our
Fundamental Belief, Respect for the Individual
Honda believes that the Human Being is born as a free and
unique individual with the capacity to think, reason and create
– and the ability to dream. Our wish is to nurture and promote
these characteristics in our company by respecting individual
differences and trusting each other as equal partners.
From this standpoint, Honda sets forth Respect for
the Individual consisting of the three elements of initiative,
equality, and trust as one of our Fundamental Beliefs. We
believe this spirit should permeate all our relationships, not
only with those in the Honda Group, but also everyone in

Our Fundamental Beliefs

Three Principles of Personnel Management
Respecting Initiative
Honda respects the individuality, creative thinking
and judgment of each associate.

Ensuring Fairness
At Honda, every person should have equal employment
opportunities. An individual’s race, gender, age, religion,
national origin, social or economic status has no impact
on the individual’s opportunities.

Encouraging Mutual Trust
Honda and its associates should respect, trust and
recognize each other as individuals and make
sincere efforts to fulfill our responsibilities.

Associate Relations Policies
To put these Three Principles into practice, Honda has established the following Associate Relations Policies:
1. Respecting individual human rights.
•	We accept the individual characteristics and differences of our associates
and respect their willingness and initiative.
•	We will always respect each individual’s basic human rights and will not
allow forced labor or child labor.

4. Creating an environment of free, open-minded dialogue.
•	The associates and the company will respect each other’s views and
endeavor to promote mutual understanding. Maintaining a relationship of
mutual trust, the associates and the company will make every effort to
engage in sincere discussions about any issues that might arise or exist.
•	Respecting freedom of association, or not to associate, and collective
bargaining, the company will attempt to resolve any and all issues in line with
the laws, conventions and usages of each respective country and region.

2. No discrimination
•	Based on the principle that all human beings should have equal
employment opportunities, we will strive to create opportunities for free
and fair competition.
•	We will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any form in the
workplace on the basis of an individual’s race, ethnicity, national origin,
religion, gender, or age among other characteristics.

5. Maintaining a working environment where each
associate can work with a sense of security.
•	The company will provide a safe and healthy workplace where all
associates can concentrate on work with a sense of security.

3. Complying with laws and ordinances.
•	We will respect the social norms, customs and culture of each country.
•	We will comply with the laws, regulations and ordinances enacted in each
country and region.

To be more precise, regional operation bases used to
be managed mainly by Japanese expatriates, however, this
style of management is being replaced with management
run by local associates who are the most familiar with the

Honda aims at establishment of an organization in
which Honda can demonstrate our total strength by
globally coordinating our operations.

Reinforcing human resources that support selfreliant operations in six global regions and enhance
Honda’s total strength
In accordance with our company principle that we are
dedicated to supplying products of highest quality yet at a
reasonable price for worldwide customer satisfaction
maintaining a global viewpoint, Honda has been proactively
developing business with a view to entering the global
markets since its foundation. In regard to our expansion
overseas, our business model has evolved from exporting
to local production and then to local development. In recent
years, our production and development functions are
under reinforcement not only in developed countries but
also in emerging countries where demand for motorization
is growing. Honda is striving for autonomy of our regional
operations in six regions worldwide.
In order to achieve this goal, Honda is pushing ahead
with global human resources management that facilitates

assigning human resources to enhance Honda’s total
strength.
One approach is to develop and reinforce local human
resources. Starting with the Honda Philosophy, Honda
Core Values, and competency, Honda aims to share values
as Honda Group associates and vitalize communication
through creating a communication environment and
making English its official language for working with
overseas. We provide training programs tailored for each
region based on its needs and conditions while offering at
the global level shared training programs to develop global
leaders.
Furthermore, in order for these global human
resources to be able to play active roles worldwide, Honda
has adopted a global job grade system (p. 69) in which
managerial positions varying from one operation base to
another in the world are defined by common grades across
the group. We aim to realize ideal management-level
assignment with the competent local personnel actively
demonstrating their abilities in respond to the needs of
global operation bases.

Setting companywide and regional policies and
objectives in two meeting structures
At Honda, the Human Resources and Associate Relations
Division at the corporate headquarters draws up global
human resources strategies from the mid- and long-term
standpoint in coordination with operations in each region.
Strategies proposed by the division are discussed by the
management members annually in the Global Strategy
Meeting.
Directions of personnel strategies deliberated in this
meeting are broken down by theme for further discussion
in the Global Human Resources Committee in which HR
responsible associates from six regions meet once a year.
Once companywide and regional plans and targets
become concrete, activities are launched in the entire
company.

Human resources management activities

Establishing a globally common foundation and developing human resources
An approach based on on-the-job training

Global leader development

Providing both on-the-job and off-the-job training to
support associates’ career development and abilities
Honda’s approach to personnel education is based on onthe-job training: building specialized skills and professional
capabilities through direct experience. In order to facilitate
effective on-the-job training, Honda has established for
every job description and area of expertise training
programs with systemized contents and levels for the
knowledge and skills required. These programs provide an
opportunity to understand each associate’s level of
expertise and control capabilities, while serving as
indicators to know if further development is needed. To
supplement these on-the-job training programs, Honda
also offers off-the-job training designed to provide
associates an opportunity to enhance their careers by
developing new specialized skills or management
capabilities. These training programs are level-specific and
include specialized training for each job description, entrylevel training, basic training based on the Honda
Philosophy, management training provided for acquisition
of new qualifications, quality training, etc.

Offering training programs to associates who will
undertake global management of future generations
As part of efforts to develop global leaders, Honda provides
training to associates chosen from operation bases all
around the world including those in Japan who will
undertake global management in the future.
The HEADS (Honda Executive Advanced Development
School) program, a combination of the executive leadership
training (off-the-job training) and an activity to draw up
plans to resolve management issues in a cross-functional
team was launched in 2012, in addition to the LDT
(Leadership Development Training) program.

Establishing the global job grade system
Introducing globally common grades for assigning
personnel to the most suitable positions globally
Besides providing training to develop global leaders who
undertake global management, Honda introduced a global
job grade system in 2011 for assigning its associates to the
most suitable positions.
In this system, individual positions existing in each
operation base of Honda such as development, production,
and sales facilities are evaluated and weighed based on
roles and responsibilities and defined by common grades
to be used group-wide in order to facilitate transfer of
associates to posts and locations in which they can
demonstrate their abilities better beyond the limits of
regions and operation. Honda has adopted this system to
positions of department and division managers of the
corporate headquarters and higher to proactively promote
local associates. We will strive to assign and utilize the
most appropriate human resources actively to operation
bases in the world in line with our growth strategies
through the Global Talent Board and Regional Talent Board
that manage worldwide key posts and key talent.

Promoting use of English as an
official language

Sharing a set of values among associates worldwide
It is important for progress of management localization to
share business judgment and codes of practice. That is to say,
to globally share a set of values such as the Honda Philosophy,
Honda core values, and competency with local associates.
With this awareness in mind, Honda provides a
training program to teach the Honda Philosophy as a part
of level-specific training that takes place worldwide. While
teaching business cases, company executives and regional
top managements make efforts to introduce practical
examples related to decision-making and business
judgments for what to consider and how to evaluate based
on the Honda Philosophy, so that the training will become
more pragmatic.

Making English an official language for
communication across regions
In order for the Honda Group to exercise its total strength
while operation bases in regions operate autonomously, it
is essential to create an environment where its associates
in the six regions can communicate closely.
In an effort to achieve this, Honda is working on
making English an official language by 2020 as a target.
With the adoption of this initiative, when inter-regional
communication takes place, information to be sent out will
be in English. Documents to be used in meetings participated
in by regional operation bases and communication for
information-sharing will also be in English.
As a part of this initiative, we strive to reinforce
training programs to improve associates’ English levels in
Japan. English proficiency will be required for associates to
be promoted to managerial positions in the future.

TOPICS Launching a human resources development program for the future of the US manufacturing industry
According to a study conducted by Deloitte, a US accounting
firm, and the Manufacturing Institute, a US NPO, although the
manufacturing industry in the United States will generate
more than 3.4 million jobs within the next 10 years, 2 million
of these jobs, approximately 60 percent, will be unfilled due to
the talent shortage.
Taking these circumstances into consideration, Honda
North America, Inc. announced in March 2015 that it will
provide a new training program to develop the next generation
workforce to be involved with cutting-edge technologies in the
manufacturing industry. The initiative intends to create interest
in manufacturing by providing educational and training
opportunities to junior high, high school and college students
as well as to offer continued learning opportunities to current
production area associates at the Honda Group.
The program includes all sorts of educational projects
tailored for each generation and takes place in Ohio where

Honda’s production base is located. For example, Honda
created a video game themed on making things (monozukuri)
and a moving lab for junior high school students to learn while
having fun. For high school students, Honda not only partners
with local high schools to develop the curriculum required for
manufacturing jobs but also funds science and engineering
curriculums. Scholarships are provided by Honda to college
students who pursue an associate degree in Manufacturing or
Mechanical Engineering Technology, in addition to an
opportunity to participate in the work-study pilot program
which allows students to go to school while working at Honda.
These programs are also designed to be utilized by Honda
suppliers for their human resources development.
Through these efforts, Honda strives to keep attracting
people with willingness and skills and to contribute to the
advancement of the manufacturing industry, the key to the US
economy, by carrying out the continued activity.

Fundamental approach to diversified workforce
Based on our fundamental belief of Respect for the
Individual, Honda pushes forward with our policy on
diversity, considering the promotion of diversity an activity
to enhance our company’s total strength, which is achieved
by members of a diverse workforce fully exercising their
abilities, while recognizing and respecting individual
differences without regard for nationality, race, gender, age,
educational background, with or without disabilities, etc.
By adding new business of jet airplanes and robots to
our main business area of motorcycles, automobiles, and
power products, Honda intends to have more encounters
with new customers globally in the future by way of
creating new products and technologies. We pursue
diversification of our workforce in line with the diversified
business development.

Expanding participation by women

Global employment

Honda has been pursuing awareness-raising activities,
through the likes of company magazines, lectures, and
training sessions, since a 2008 decision to focus on
expanding opportunities for participation by women in
Japan. As a result, the proportion of female associates in
the workforce has increased from 5.0% to 6.7% within the
past 10 years.
However, women in management positions account
for as little as 0.5%, highlighting the need for additional
support for career development of female associates. As a
part of this effort, in January 2015, Honda established the
Diversity Promotion Office, an organization specialized in
diversifying our workforce, where full-time career advisors
help female associates and their supervisors to develop
their careers.
As a management indicator for career development of
female associates, Honda has also set targets to more
than triple the number of women holding management
positions in FY2015 by 2020, and more than 9 times the
number in FY2015 by 2025. With the Diversity Promotion
Office playing a central role in initiatives in the future to
further support career development of each associate and
to improve childcare support programs to gear up career
development, Honda aims to achieve the targets.

As a part of efforts to diversify our human resources,
Honda has started a global employment program where
some of the new graduates who join our company are
hired directly from overseas labor markets. We especially
put emphasis on hiring from labor markets in emerging
countries where Honda plans to develop business further.
We strive to raise the total strength of our global
workforce by developing these employees to be a core of
our human resources who drive Honda’s global business in
the future.

Employment of people with disabilities

Building healthy working environments

Honda actively provides jobs to people with disabilities at
its facilities in compliance with laws in each country where
we do business. We strive to create an environment that
allows associates with and without disabilities to work
alongside one another, in addition to making adaptations to
ensure that workplaces and opportunities are fully accessible.
We also offer employment at our affiliates in Japan,
Honda Sun Co., Ltd., Honda R&D Sun Co., Ltd., and
Kibounosato Honda Co., Ltd. Employment of individuals
with disabilities at Honda Group companies in Japan in
FY2015 stands at 2.28%, or 1,089 individuals, well above
the legally mandated level of 2.0%.

Helping associates balance the demands of
work, parenting, and nursing care
In Japan’s increasingly aging society with a declining
birthrate, establishing an environment where people can
balance work, parenting, and nursing care is a social issue.
Under such circumstances, Honda works actively to
provide programs that help associates balance the
demands of work, parenting and nursing care, and to gain
understanding of these programs by sending information
by the means of guidebooks and the corporate intranet.
In April 2014, we introduced a selection-based welfare
program (Cafeteria Plan) giving associates the options of
support for nursing care, as well as life events such as
childbirth and childcare, including babysitter agent services
and childcare item rental.
As a result of these initiatives, Honda has been
certified as a company that supports child-raising by the
Japanese Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare.

Rehiring retirees
In Japan’s super aging society in which people aged 65
years or older account for about 25 % of its population, we
face challenges including stable employment of senior
citizens and how to pass on their skills and knowhow.
Honda introduced a system in April 2003 to create
opportunities for those associates who reach the
retirement age of 60. Our proactive approach preceded the
2004 amendments of laws governing the employment of
retired individuals. Honda instituted changes of the system
in April 2010 in principle to offer all interested associates
re-employment until the age of 65 in operations that utilize
each individual’s specialized knowledge.
As a result, currently about 75 % of all associates
retired at the mandatory age of 60 are re-employed,
drawing on their extensive experience and specialized
knowledge to contribute actively in a variety of workplaces
throughout the company.

Optimizing work hours
Whereas workers working long hours and taking less paid
days off are raised as social issues in Japan, Honda has
always been an industry leader in introducing shorter
workweeks. The company instituted a five-day workweek
on alternating weeks in 1970, followed by a true five-day
workweek in 1972. Other initiatives enjoyed by associates
for more than 40 years include the banning of overtime on
Wednesdays and Fridays and the introduction of a policy
encouraging all associates--both labor and management-to use their allotted vacation time in full*.

Furthermore, to encourage our associates to take
regular annual paid vacations and use their vacation time
effectively to refresh themselves and increase motivation,
Honda has recently introduced a system whereby associates
are accorded blocks of three to five consecutive paid
holidays, depending on their years of continuous service.
As a result, total working hours averaged 1,890 per
associate in FY 2015, and associates averaged 19.4 paid

hotline

Honda offers life planning seminars to give
associates an opportunity to start thinking
about life purpose, health, and economic
planning so that they will be able to lead a rich
and fulfilling life after age 60. Seminars are
also open to associates’ spouses. In-house
seminar instructors and a secretariat offer
one-on-one counselling for associates who
have participated in the seminar.

Supply Chain

In accordance with Respecting Initiative and Ensuring
Fairness coming from the Three Principles of Personnel
Management, Honda has introduced to the regional
operations in the six global regions human resources
evaluation programs adopted to the needs and conditions
of each region.
For example, in Japan Honda places emphasis on twoway communication with supervisors in associate
development and evaluation, and all associates have at
least three interviews with their supervisors each year.
During the first interview in April, associates come out with
a clear vision for the future and their direction going
forward through their supervisor’s advice. They then work
out their individual role based on the organization’s
business goals for the fiscal year in question. During
interviews in June and December, supervisors evaluate
associate performance during the preceding six months
and share an assessment of each associate’s strengths
and weaknesses. By facilitating a discussion of subjects
such as future objectives and career directions, the
interviews pave the way for associates’ skill development.

Associate survey

Based on the Three Principles of Personnel Management,
Honda gives its associates equal opportunities to make the
most of the individual’s potential, and recognizes and
respects their abilities and accomplishments equally at
worksites regardless of personal factors. Our
compensation and evaluation system is built in line with
this basic approach in consideration of the needs and
conditions of each region.
Performance of general employees at Honda in Japan
is evaluated in two stages under this system: development
of abilities and demonstration of abilities. In the former
stage, Honda places emphasis more on how associates’
abilities are evolved, whereas associates’ demonstration
of abilities and achievement are focused on in the latter
stage. An annual salary system is applied to compensation
for employees in management positions or higher. The
higher their positions are, the more their accomplishments
and company performance are taken into consideration.

Honda conducts an associate survey in all regions to solicit
worker feedback for building a healthier work environment.
Taking place once every three years in Japan to
coincide with the company’s mid-term plan, the surveys
include a variety of questions designed to gauge associate
views on organizational culture, the company’s personnel
system, and management. Survey results are fed back to
associates through in-house publications and are also
incorporated into HR-related initiatives, such as management
training and changes to the personnel system.

As a company that holds Respect for the Individual as one
of the fundamental beliefs, Honda has shared the value of
“no safety, no production” within the group since its
founding. Based on this value, Honda group companies in
various parts of the world have established basic policies
for occupational health and safety rooted in each region to
carry out activities from the standpoint of preventing
industrial accidents and their recurrence.
With our global mid-term policy in relation to
workplace safety of nurturing a safety-first culture and
building organizational infrastructure to instill safety
assurance as part of our corporate foundations, Honda is
pursuing the following key measures.
1.	Development, purchase, production, sales, management
and so on instigating area–specific initiatives aimed at totally
eliminating industrial accidents
2.	Building up safety support systems for global operations
3.	Standardizing fire prevention management systems
4.	Totally eliminating traffic accidents through strengthening of
safe driving management and thorough implementation of
awareness-raising activities (Japan)

Establishment of good relationship

In accordance with Mutual Trust coming from the Three
Principles of Personnel Management Honda declares in
the Associate Relations Policies that the associates and
the company will respect each other’s views and endeavor
to promote mutual understanding. Maintaining a
relationship of mutual trust, the associates and the
company will make every effort to engage in sincere

Global administration for safety

During FY2015, a period in which we completed
entrenching firmly measures for strengthening safety
functions mainly for the high-risk production area, we
established the foundation for stable implementation of
our tripartite approach*. In FY2016, we will undertake
reinforcement of occupational health and safety functions
of each region to entrench our activities to prevent
industrial accidents globally at a high rate.

Head offices in Honda regional companies are taking the
lead in putting global control for safety in place.
For the production area, particularly, local offices are
leading activities vigorously focusing on implementation of
management system regarding occupational health and
safety, diffusion and execution of risk assessment and
establishment of explosion and fire prevention. We
conduct occupational health and safety audits and reviews
as needed to share recognition of health and safety
management, while striving to improve the management
system and develop human resources for safety control in
each country and region.

*	Tripartite approach: Consists of safety management structure with
disciplinary, rule-making, and administrative roles.

Health management efforts in Japan
Medical checkups

Honda has implemented a program of as-needed medical examinations for associates, such as checkups for leaving for business
trips abroad or long-term assignments overseas, on top of checkups for new hires and regular checkups as required by law. Targeted
checkups are offered to associates aged 35 or older instead of the statutory age of 40 or older. By starting the targeted checkups 5
years earlier than required by law, Honda aims to lay stress on early discovery of associates’ health problems while giving them
targeted health guidance to prevent adult-onset diseases.

Preventing
musculoskeletal
disorders*

Honda is incorporating the perspective of ergonomics into the creation of work environments in line with its concept of peoplefriendly production processes. This approach includes analysis of worker movements to ensure optimal work position and scope as
well as installation of assistive devices and auxiliary lifts for work that involves lifting heavy objects. We also introduced a system in
2013 to scientifically analyze the actual burden applied to a human body. With analytical tools that we developed originally, Honda is
working to improve the work environments where the burden imposed on associates is reduced.

Health guidance

In 2009 Honda began offering targeted health guidance in how to prevent adult-onset diseases based on results of associates’ regular
medical checkups, in addition to support for associate staying in good health with the help of the selection-based welfare program.
Through these initiatives, we support at-risk associates to take the initiative to become healthier by giving advice on improving their
life rhythm, nutrition guidance that proposes improvements in diet, and exercise instruction with a daily exercise regimen.

Health promoting
events

Honda carries out awareness-raising activities for associates to get and stay healthy through initiatives including health promoting
events such as a walking event conceived to spur associates to develop good exercise habits and to refresh themselves.

Prevention of danger
of second-hand
smoke

Honda is undertaking creating workplaces where there is no danger of second-hand smoke. Our activities in line with needs and
conditions of our operation facilities include prohibiting smoking inside buildings, setting non-smoking hours, holding events to
coincide with World No Tobacco Day, and making a given day of a month a no-smoking challenge day. We also carry out awarenessraising activities for smokers and extend support to associates who want to quit smoking.

Mental health care

Honda has put together a mental health team to station at its facilities in an effort to foster associates’ mental health based on
principal policies: education about prevention, improvement of workplace environment, stress checks, enhancement of counseling
programs, and a system to help returning employees to the workplace. We also distribute leaflets and pamphlets to associates to
facilitate understanding of mental health care.

*	 Musculoskeletal disorders: injuries to the nerves and muscles of the neck, back, arms, and legs as well as surrounding issues due to simple, repetitive tasks
or work that imposes too great a physical burden on the body
