Special Study of Securities Markets and its Implementation

Fiscal year 1964, which marked the 30th year of the Commission's
existence, and the months that followed was a period of extraordinary,
even historic, significance for the Commission, the parts of the nation's
economy which are concerned with the issuance and trading of securities, and, of course, public investors.
Shortly after the beginning of the year, the final two portions of
the Report of the Special Study of Securities Markets were transmitted
to Congress," The Special Study and the Report, constituting the
most thorough examination of the securities markets since the early
1930's, have already had far-reaching consequences. Even while the
study was still in progress, it stimulated an extensive self-examination by various segments of the securities industry, most notably the
self-regulatory agencies, which resulted in a number of improvements
in the rules and practices of those agencies. Secondly, the Report
provided a foundation for the far-reaching legislative proposals submitted by the Commission to Congress in June 1963, which, with certain modifications, were enacted into law in August 1964. This legislation (the "Securities Acts Amendments of 1964") is summarized
in Part IT of this Report and referred to at appropriate points elsewhere in the Report,"
The 1964 Amendments represent the most significant statutory
advance in Federal securities regulation and investor protection since
1940. Inthe main, they eliminate the differences in reporting requirements between issuers of securities listed on the exchanges and the
larger issuers whose securities are traded over the counter, allow the
self-regulatory agencies and the Commission to raise standards for

entry into the securities business, and strengthen the Commission in
dealing with broker-dealers and their employees. The legislation
was strongly supported in principle by representatives of the securities
industry and by others affected by it, and it benefited from extensive
hearings by the Congress which permitted a thorough consideration
of all of the issues involved. In signing the measure, the President
stated: "The law signed today should further strengthen the securities
markets and public confidence in them. Industry and government
have worked together in the writing of these laws. Industry and
government will work together in making these measures succeed."
A number of changes in the Commission's rules have already been
effected or proposed to implement the new legislation or to conform
the rules to it. One important area still to be implemented relates
to the Commission's new authority to prescribe qualification standards
and standards of conduct for those registered broker-dealers who are
not members of a registered securities association. The Commission
is now gathering more precise and fuller information as to the persons
and firms affected and assessing the regulatory needs and problems
which may be anticipated.
Significant progress has been made in the way of administrative
action by the Commission and the self-regulatory agencies in implementing the recommendations of the Special Study Report. This is,
of course, a continuing process, and what is referred to herein as
prospective action may well be accomplished fact by the time this
Report appears in print. In one of the principal areas also dealt
with in the Amendments, qualification standards applicable to members and their employees have been tightened by the self-regulatory
agencies. Proposed amendments to the Commission's net capital rule
establishing for the first time a minimum net capital for broker-dealers
were submitted to the industry on an informal basis for comments;
comments have now been received and the proposal will be considered
by the Commission before it is officially published for comment.
The Commission's staff has devoted considerable effort to assisting
the self-regulatory groups in the formulation of effective rules governing selling practices. Primary emphasis was placed on supervision
of salesmen by the principals of broker-dealer firms. The New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) adopted a new supervision rule in the
spring of 1964. The Board of Governors of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) has approved a package of rules
which set out in detail members' responsibilities for supervision,
maintenance of certain records and handling of discretionary accounts.
As of October 1964,these rules were submitted to the NASD membership for adoption. At the same time increased attention is being paid

THIRTIETH

by the self-regulatory agencies to inspections of brokerage firms and
enforcement of selling practice rules. The NYSE, American, and several regional exchanges have adopted new rules and interpretations
with respect to advertising and investment advice. The NASD
Board of Governors has adopted a comprehensive interpretation with
respect to these matters. And the Commission's staff has drafted
comparable rules applicable to investment advisers which will be
submitted informally to the industry for comment in the very near
future.
Two of the areas which were studied in great depth by the Special
Study and were subjects in its Report of recommendations for extensive changes were the activities and responsibilities of floor traders
and specialists on the exchanges. These recommendations in turn
gave rise to extended discussions between members of the staff and of
the New York and American stock exchanges, culminating in the
adoption, on June 2, 1964, of Rule lla-1 under the Exchange Act,"
the first Commission rule ever adopted relating to floor trading, and
the announcement, on September 24, 1964, of proposed Rule llb-1
relating to specialists.' Briefly, the purpose of Rule lla-1 is to eliminate the abuses which the Commission found in floor trading on the
two major exchanges. The new provisions require that traders must
have substantial capital and they are subjected to high performance
standards, various conditions designed to eliminate or minimize possible conflicts with public customers, and other restrictions intended
to channel their trading for beneficial purposes." Upon the effectiveness of the rule, about 30 traders became registered on the NYSE, as
compared with an estimated 300 persons who engaged in floor trading
in recent years.
The proposed specialist rule, which also applies only to the two
large New York exchanges, forms an integrated regulatory program
together with rules which have been adopted by those exchanges
and which will take effect concurrently with the effectiveness of Rule
Llb-L It contains three major parts. The first part would require
the exchanges to have adequate rules in certain areas. Thus, for the
first time the exchange rules would have to impose an affirmative obligation on specialists to utilize their capital as dealers to assist in the
maintenance of a fair and orderly market, and the proposed exchange
rules so provide. Additionally each exchange would have to establish
adequate minimum capital amounts for specialists and provide effective methods of surveillance of specialist activities. Finally, the ex• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7330.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

changes would be required to have rules on the brokerage responsibilities of specialists. Among the changes adopted by the exchanges are
rules designed to assure that specialists' brokerage customers receive
the best possible prices available and that the specialist does not give
himself preferential treatment over his own customers. The second
part of Rule llb--1 would establish a procedure by which the Commission can review and disapprove new exchange rules relating to specialists if the Commission finds that they are inadequate to achieve the
purposes described in the rule or are inconsistent with the public
interest or the protection
of investors. The Commission, of
course, would retain the authority contained in Section 11 of the Exchange Act to adopt its own rules regulating the conduct of specialists
if that becomes necessary. The third part of Rule llb--1 would permit
the Commission to commence proceedings directly against a specialist
in certain cases where an exchange has failed to do so or its action has
been inadequate.
Turning to the over-the-counter markets, a new Rule 15c2-7 requires dealers entering quotations in a system such as the "sheets" of
the National Quotation Bureau to disclose whether they are acting
as correspondents, or have entered into some other financial arrangements with other dealers, and the identity of the latter. This information is to be revealed in the published quotations by symbol, number
or otherwise. The rule should improve significantly the reliability of
the wholesale quotations system and make it more informative,"
Extensive consideration is also being given by the Commission and the
NASD to revisions of the retail quotations system.
During the 1964 fiscal year, the qpmmission established an Office of
Regulation within its Division of Trading and Markets, one of whose
primary responsibilities is to oversee the operations of the self-regulatory agencies. In pursuit of that goal, the Office has conducted continuing inspections of various operations of the exchanges and the
NASD. Furthermore, the new Rule i7a-8, requiring the exchanges
to file with the Commission reports of newly proposed rules, enables
the Commission to be a ware, on"a continuing basis, of developments in
an exchange's policies and to offer the exchange, at an early point, the
benefit of its views." Important steps have also been taken by the
self-regulatory agencies, particularly the NASD, to effect organizetional changes in line with the. views expressed in the Special Study
Report.

The above are only some of the many steps.already taken or under
active consideration as a result of the Special Study and its Report,

Enforcement Activity: Proposed Revision of Annual Report Form for
Investment Companies

Although the Commission's attention during the 1964fiscal year was
focused to a considerable extent on the implementation of the Special
Study's recommendations, its day-to-day enforcement activities, designed to combat fraudulent and other illegal practices in securities
transactions, continued at a vigorous level. Details regarding the
various aspects of these activities will be found in the appropriate
parts of this Report. Among other things, 50 cases were referred to
the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution during the year.
On the civil side, 84 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings
were instituted by the Commission in the Federal courts. And 458
investigations of securities transactions involving possible violations
of the anti-fraud or other provisions of the securities acts were instituted. A substantial number of formal administrative proceedings
were instituted with respect to broker-dealers and investment advisers-1l9
broker-dealer proceedings and 9 investment adviser
proceedings.
The Commission's inspection program under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which has proceeded at a steadily accelerating pace
since its inception in 1957, resulted in a record total of 146 inspections
during the 1964 fiscal year. Even at that rate, however, each of the
617 so-called "active" registered investment companies would be inspected only once every 4.2 years. To place the inspection program
even on a 3-year cycle would require additional personnel and entail
other related expenses. It also takes time and expense to train inspectors, many of whom must necessarily be new recruits, to achieve a high
degree of proficiency. The Commission has proposed expansion of its
inspection program because of its proven value.
Even under an expanded inspection program, certain investment
companies inevitably require closer or prompter scrutiny. Because
of this and the continued growth in the number and size of investment
companies, the Commission considered that the public interest and the
protection of investors would be served by strengthening the annual
report filed by investment companies, and accordingly it published a
proposal, shortly after the end of the fiscal year, to revise the present
Form N-30A-1, which is the current annual reporting form for all
registered management investment companies except those which issue
periodic payment plan certificates and small business investment companies licensed as such under the Small Business Investment Act of
1958.s
• Investment Company Act Release No. 4026 (August 4,1964).

6

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The proposed form, which emerged from some 2 years of drafting
and redrafting by the staff, with the benefit of discussions and correspondence with committees representing the investment company
industry and the accounting profession, is designed to provide better
disclosure to the investing public and to channel more effectively the
Commission's inspection program. The form, either as published for
comment or as it may be modified prior to adoption, should also serve
to focus attention of the investment companies and their management
more sharply on the prohibitions and requirements of the Investment
Company Act and thus provide a significant measure of self-regulation.
Registration of New Security Offerings

The 1964 fiscal year saw a slight increase over the previous year in
the number of registration statements filed, but a substantial increase
in the dollar amount involved. A total of 1,192 statements was filed
during the year for securities with an aggregate offering price of $18.6
billion, as compared to 1,159 statements and $14.7 billion the preceding
year.
In the course of the fiscal year, the Commission published an extensive guide containing numerous policies and practices of its Division
of Corporation Finance with respect to the disclosures required by the
Securities Act of 1933 and the rules thereunder in connection with the
filing of registration statements under the Act," It is expected that the
publication of these policies and practices will not only be of assistance
to registrants and their counsel and accountants in the preparation
of registration statements, but also that it will relieve the staff of the
Commission of the necessity for commenting on these matters in respect of such statements.
The Commission and its staff are constantly striving to reduce the
time required to process registration statements, without, of course,
diminishing the thoroughness of the examination procedure. During
the year, there was a further significant reduction. Thus, with respect
to registration statements which became effective during the year (excluding certain investment company filings), the median number of
days elapsing from the date of filing to the date of the staff's letter of
comment was 16, as compared with 27 the previous year; and the
median time from filing to effective date was 36 days as compared to 52
days the year before. A total of 1,121 statements in the amount of

LEGISLATIVE

AcrIVITIES

During the fiscal year 1964, Congressional hearings were completed
on the Commission's proposals for amendment of the Federal securities
laws. Hearings had previously been held in the United States Senate
before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Banking and Currency,
immediately prior to the close of the fiscal year 1963, and during those
hearings the broad purposes of the legislation were strongly endorsed
by all segments of the securities industry. S. 1642, the Senate bill embodying the Commission's proposals, was passed by the Senate on
July 30, 1963 and referred to the House of Representatives. A Subcommittee of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce,
House of Representatives, held hearings for a total of 13 days on S.
1642 and two companion bills, H.R. 6789 and H.R. 6793.1 After the
close of the fiscal year, S. 1642 was passed by the House with certain
amendments agreed to by the Senate, and was enacted as Public Law
88-467 on August 20, 1964. With some exceptions, the legislation as
enacted was closely similar to the Commission's original proposals.
The Commission's legislative proposals were based upon the Report
of the Special Study of Securities Markets 2 and had two major purposes. The first was to improve investor protections in the over-thecounter markets, primarily by extending to investors in a significant
portion of the securities traded in those markets the fundamental
protections which had been afforded generally only to investors in
securities listed on a national securities exchange. Under the legislation as proposed by the Commission, the registration, periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and insider reporting and trading provisions
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were to be extended to overthe-counter companies having more than 750 shareholders (500 share1These identical bllls had been introduced on ;rune 4, 1963.

holders at a subsequent date) and more than $1,000,000in assets. Companies meeting these standards would be required to file a registration
statement containing material 'information regarding their businesses
and to keep such information current by periodic reports; security
holders whose proxies are solicited would be furnished with a proxy
statement containing adequate and accurate information; and corporate "insiders" would be required to report their transactions in the
securities of such companies and would be liable for short-swing trading profits in the securities of their company. Certain classes of companies were exempted from these requirements. The Commission's
proposals in this area were embodied in Public Law 88-467, but were
modified by the Congress to exempt also insurance companies which
meet certain specified requirements.
The second purpose of the Commission's proposals was to strengthen
the qualification standards for entrance into the securities business
and to make more effective the disciplinary controls of the Commission
and the rules of industry self-regulatory organizations over securities
brokers and dealers and persons associated with them. Under the
Commission's proposals registered securities associations were to be
required to adopt rules, subject to Commission approval, establishing
standards of training, experience and competence for members and
their employees and to establish capital requirements for members. In
addition, all over-the-counter broker-dealers would have been required
to be members of a registered securities association in order to bring
them within the self-regulatory scheme. Public Law 88-467 did not
embody the latter proposal, but provides instead that if a brokerdealer is not a member of a registered securities association, the
broker-dealer and all natural persons associated with the brokerdealer must meet such specified and appropriate standards with respect to training, experience and such other qualifications as the
Commission finds necessary or desirable. Public Law 88-467 includes
the Commission's other proposals in this area, including modification
of the statutory scheme for disciplining violators so as to permit action
directly against an individual; provision for the imposition of intermediate sanctions against a broker-dealer, such as temporary suspension or censure; and clarification of the authority of a national securities association to act directly against offending individuals.
In connection with Congressional consideration of the Commission's
legislative proposals, members of the Commission testified before a
Subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce on November 19 and 20, 1963 and on February 18 and 19,
1964. In addition Chairman Cary testified on March 5, 1964 before
the House Committee on the District of Columbia in favor of H.R.

the District of Columbia and the licensing of persons engaged in that

Subcommittee on Census and Government Statistics of the House
Committee on Post Office and Civil Service in connection with the
Subcommittee's inquiry into the reporting and paper work requirements of the various Governmental agencies. During the fiscal year
the Commission analyzed a total of 31 bills and legislative proposals
submitted by Congressional Committees or the Bureau of the Budget.

The bill was enacted into law on August 30, 1964, as Public Law 88-503.

PART III
REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS
Several new rules were either adopted or proposed during the 1964
fiscal year as a direct result of recommendations made in the Report of
the Special Study of Securities Markets. In addition, the Commission maintains a continuing program of reviewing its rules, regulations and forms in order to determine whether any changes are appropriate. Certain members of the staff are specifically assigned to this
task, but changes are also suggested, from time to time, by other members of the staff and by persons outside of the Commission who are
subject to the Commission's requirements or who have occasion to
work with those requirements in a professional capacity, such as
underwriters, attorneys and accountants. With a few exceptions
provided for by the Administrative Procedure Act, proposed new
rules, regulations and forms and proposed changes in existing
rules, regulations and forms are published in preliminary form for
the purpose of obtaining the views and comments of interested persons, including issuers and various industry groups, which are given
careful consideration.' The changes which were made during the
fiscal year as well as those proposed changes which were published in
preliminary form and were pending at the end of the year are described
below.
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
Adoption of Rule 156

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted Rule 156 which
defines as "transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering"
in Section 4(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, transactions which are
exempted from the Investment Company Act of 1940 by Rule 3c-3,
recently adopted thereunder."

Rule 3e-3 exempts from the provisions of the Investment Company
Act transactions by any insurance company with respect to certain
group annuity contracts with employers or their representatives covering at least 25 employees and providing for the administration of
funds held by such companies in one or more so-called "separate accounts" established and maintained pursuant to state law. It has
boon represented to the Commission that because of the variety and
complexity of such contracts, they must be separately negotiated with
employers who retain expert advisers, are fully informed in the matter and are in 'a position to fend for themselves.
The new rule under the Securities Act provides that transactions
of the character referred to therein shall come within the rule only
if the transaction is not advertised by any written communication
which, insofar as it relates to a separate account group annuity contract, does more than identify the insurance company, state that it is
engaged in the business of writing such contracts and invite inquiries
in regard thereto. The rule provides, however, that the limitation on
advertising shall not apply to disclosure made in the course of direct
discussion or negotiation of such contracts.
It should be noted that the rule provides an exemption only from
the provisions of Section 5 of the Act and does not afford any exemption from the anti-fraud provisions of the Act.
Amendments to Form 8-1, Form S-8 and Form 8-11

The Commission announced during the fiscal year that it had under
consideration amendments to Forms S-l, 8-8, and S-11 believed to
be necessary and appropriate in view of changes made by the Revenue
Act of 1964 in the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating
to stock options eligible for special tax treatment.
(See Section 221
of the Revenue Act of 1964, Public Law 88-272, 78 Stat. 19).3 These
changes limit the types of stock options which are to receive favorable
tax treatment; they eliminate the term "restricted stock options," except with respect to options which have already been granted or may
be granted pursuant to existing plans or contracts; and they designate
other tax-favored options as "qualified" or as options granted pursuant
to "employee stock purchase plans."
The three forms, which are used for the registration of securities
under the Securities Act, require the furnishing of certain information
regarding options to purchase securities. The proposed amendments
were designed to make these forms consistent with the Internal Revenue Code as amended, i.e.,' to provide for all tax-favored options the

same exemptive or other favorable treatment as had been extended to
the previous tax-favored options.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the proposed amendments
were adopted.'
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Amendments of Rules 10b-6 and 16b-3 and Form 10

In view of the changes made by the Revenue Act of 1964 in the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to stock options eligible
for special tax treatment, as previously described," the Commission
announced during the fiscal year that it had under consideration the
adoption of amendments to Rules 10b-6 and 16b-3 and Form 10 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would conform those rules
and the form to the changes in the Code."
-
 Form 10 is used for the registration of securities on a national securities exchange. Rule 10b-6- makes it unlawful for certain persons
participating or expecting to participate in a distribution of securities,
including the issuer of the securities involved in such distribution, to
purchase any such security, or any security of the same class or series,
until completion of their participation in the distribution, subject to
specified exceptions. Paragraph
(e) of the rule exempts from its
provisions certain distributions pursuant to stock option plans. Rule
16b-3 provides an exemption from the insider trading provisions of
Section 16(b) for the acquisition of stock options pursuant to a plan
meeting specified conditions.
The proposed amendments were adopted subsequent to the close
of the fiscal year,"
Adoption of Rule lla-l

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted a new Rule 11a-l a
under Section 11 of the Exchange Act to limit or restrict floor trading
on national securities exchanges. The rule provides that no member
of a national securities exchange may, while on the floor of such exchange or other premises made available for the use of members generally, initiate any transaction in any security traded on the exchange
for any account in which he has an interest or in which he is vested
with more than the usual broker's discretion, unless the transaction

comes under specified exemptions or conditions. An important exemption relates to transactions effected in conformity with a plan
adopted by an exchange designed to eliminate floor trading activities
not beneficial to the market, provided such plan is approved by the
Commission.
The propriety of floor trading by members has been a highly controversial subject over the years and was one which particularly
concerned Congress in 1934 in its consideration of the Exchange Act.
Although early drafts of the legislation contemplated. a complete prohibition of the practice, the statute as finally enacted included in
Section 11(a) a broad grant of authority to the Commission to prescribe such rules and regulations as it might deem necessary to either
regulate or prevent floor trading by members. The Commission in the
past preferred not to adopt its own rules but relied instead upon rules
adopted by the exchanges to control floor trading. Experience demonstrated, however, and studies by the Commission confirmed, that
regulation by the exchanges was not effective and in many respects
misdirected. Floor traders retained their significant and unwarranted
private trading advantage in the market without contributing any corresponding benefit to public investors, continued to concentrate their
activities in the more active stocks where member trading is least
needed, continued to accentuate price movements and frequently interfered with the orderly execution of public brokerage orders by delaying
their consummation or by adversely affecting the price at which they
are executed. Rule 11a-1 and the exchange plans adopted pursuant to
it are intended to provide a comprehensive system for the regulation of
floor trading.
Both the Xew York Stock Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange have adopted floor trading plans which have been approved
by the Commission and declared effective." The regional exchanges
have been granted exemptions from the provisions of the rule.
The NYSE and AMEX plans are essentially identical and provide
for an exemption from the floor trading prohibition for a new member
category known as the "registered trader." These members will be
required to meet capital requirements over and above the capital required for other member activities and will be required to pass an
examination on the rules and requirements applicable to registered
traders. They will be prohibited from executing' brokerage orders

in a way calculated to contribute to the orderliness of the market
and will be prohibited from engaging in transactions which would have
a disruptive effect upon the market. Finally, they will be required
to yield priority, precedence or parity to public orders. The Commission anticipates that the net effect of Rule lla-l and these exchange plans will be to restrict floor trading to a small group of
professional dealers whose activities will be of maximum assistance
to the public in the execution of orders on the exchange.
Amendment of Rule 14a-3

Rule 14a-3 relates to the information to be furnished to security
holders in connection with the solicitation of proxies. It provides,
among other things, that where the management of an issuer solicits
proxies for an annual meeting of security holders for the purpose of
electing directors, its proxy statement shall be accompanied or preceded by an annual report to such security holders containing such
financial statements for the last fiscal year as will in the opinion of
management adequately reflect the financial position and operations
of the issuer. During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted certain
amendments to the rule.lO
The amended rule requires the inclusion of consolidated financial
statements of the issuer and its subsidiaries in such annual reports to
security holders if such statements are necessary to reflect adequately
the financial position and results of operations of the issuer and its
subsidiaries. However, in such cases the individual financial statements of the issuer may be omitted.
Compliance with the requirements for financial statements filed with
the Commission is not required, but any material differences between
the principles of consolidation or other accounting principles and
practices, or methods of applying accounting principles or practices,
applicable to such statements and those reflected in the report to security holders must be noted and the effect thereof reconciled or explained in such report. Provision is made, however, for the omission
of details and for suitable condensation in the financial statements
included in the report to security holders, provided this does not
under the circumstances result in the presentation of misleading
financial statements.
The 'amended rule provides that the financial statements included
in reports to security holders shall be certified by independent public
or certified public accountants, unless certification is not required in
annual reports filed with the Commission or the Commission finds
that certification would be impracticable or would involve undue effort

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Amendment to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 and Form 7-K

Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 require certain real estate companies to
file quarterly reports with respect to distributions to shareholders.
Form 7-K is the form prescribed for such reports. During the fiscal
year, the Commission adopted certain amendments to Rules 13a-15
and 15d-15 and Form 7-KP
The rules as amended require the .filing of quarterly reports on
Form 7-K by real estate investment trusts and by real estate companies which as a matter of policy or practice make distributions to
shareholders from sources other than current or retained earnings.
Other real estate companies are required to file reports with .respect
to quarters in which a distribution is made from a source other than
current or retained earnings. The amended rules provide :for the
filing of reports not-more than 60 days after the end of the .fiscal
quarter to which they relate except that the report for the last quarter
of the .fiscalyear must be filed not more than 120 days after the close
of the .fiscal year. Prior to the amendment the quarterly reports
were required to be .filed within 45 days after the close of the quarter.
The extension of the period for filing reports for the .first three
quarters should provide adequate opportunity for the collection of
information called for by the report by issuers holding numerous
properties. The extension of the period for filing the report for the
fourth quarter should provide opportunity for reflecting in the information reported any year-end adjustments made in connection with
the annual audit of the issuer's accounts or otherwise.
Form 7-K has been amended to eliminate the two-column reporting
previously required and to clarify the language of the items. In
particular, the form has been amplified to provide directions for treatment of minority interests, mortgages received on the sale of property
and businesses acquired during the period covered by the report.
Adoption of Rule 15c2-7

The rule implements a recommendation of the Report of the Special
Study of Securities Markets designed to improve the reliability and
informativeness of the wholesale quotations system through which
dealers advertise their buying or selling interests in securities traded
over-the-counter. The "sheets" published by the National Quotation
Bureau, Inc., are the primary medium for the dissemination of Wholesale or "inside" quotations among broker-dealers in the over-theU

THIRTIETH ANNUAL

REPORT

17

counter markets. Broker-dealers use the sheets to communicate buying
and selling interests in securities by placing their names in the sheets,
together with accompanying quotations. However, if a broker-dealer
submits a quotation to the sheets on behalf of another broker-dealer,
there is no indication in the sheets that the appearing broker-dealer
is quoting a market on behalf of another. The Special Study pointed
out that the failure to differentiate in any way quotations entered for
correspondents and quotations representing multiple expressions of
the same market, prevents persons using the sheets from determining
the actual depth and activity of the market for a particular security
and the identity of the actual primary market makers for such security.
This failure to differentiate quotations entered by one broker-dealer
on behalf of another from other quotations may also result, as documented by the Special Study, in the use of the sheets for fraudulent
or manipulative purposes.
The purpose of Rule 15c2-7 is to insure that an inter-dealer quotation system clearly reveals those instances where two or more quotations in different names for a particular security represent a single
quotation or where one broker-dealer appears as a correspondent of
another. The rule requires a broker-dealer who is a correspondent
for another firm for a particular security and enters quotations in
the sheets to inform the service of the correspondent arrangement
and the identity of his correspondent. By requiring disclosure of
the correspondent, as well as of the fact of such an arrangement, the
rule permits users of the sheets to determine the identity of dealers
making an inter-dealer market for a security-a fact which may be
extremely pertinent in evaluating its marketability.
The rule also requires that where two or more broker-dealers place
quotations in the sheets pursuant to any other arrangement between
or among broker-dealers, the identity of each broker-dealer participating in any such arrangement or arrangements, and the fact that
an arrangement exists, must be disclosed. Because of the variety of
market-making arrangements between broker-dealers resulting in appearances in the sheets, the rule does not limit the type of arrangement
covered; the purpose of the rule is to cover any arrangement between
broker-dealers, such as joint accounts, guarantees of profit or against
loss, commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, indications of interest and
accommodations.>

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Adoption of Rule 15c3-2

The Special Study of Securities Markets found that many customers
of broker-dealers were unaware (1) that when they leave free credit
balances (funds which the customer has an unrestricted right to withdraw) with a broker-dealer the funds generally are not segregated
and held for the customer but are commingled with other funds of the
broker-dealer and used in the operation of his business, and (2) that
the relationship between the broker-dealer and the customer as a result
thereof is that of debtor-creditor. The purpose of Rule 15c3-2 is to
put customers on notice that free credit balances left with the brokerdealer may be used in the business and therefore may be at risk. The
rule, effective August 3, 1964, prohibits a broker or dealer from using
in his business any funds arising out of any free credit balance carried for the account of any customer unless he has established adequate
procedures pursuant to which each such customer will be given or
sent, together with or as a part of the customer's statement of account,
whenever sent, but not less frequently than once every 3 months, a written statement informing the customer of the amount due, and containing a written notice that such funds are not segregated and may be
used in the operation of the business of the broker-dealer, and that such
funds are payable on demand. The rule provides an exemption for
a banking institution supervised and examined by state or Federal
authority having supervision over banks."
Adoption of Rule 16b-9

During the fiscal year, the Commission: adopted a new Rule 16b-9
which exempts from the operation of Section 16(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 certain transactions in which shares of stock are
exchanged for similar shares of stock of the same issuer.l4 Section
16(b) provides for the recovery, by or on behalf of an issuer of equity
securities registered under the Exchange Act, of short-term trading
profits realized by directors, officers and principal security holders of
the issuer. The Commission is authorized to exempt from Section
16(b) transactions not comprehended within the purpose of that
section.
The new rule exempts from the operation of Section 16(b) any
acquisition or disposition of shares of stock of an issuer in exchange
for an equivalent number of shares of another class of stock of the
same issuer pursuant to a right of conversion under the terms of the
issuer's charter or other governing instruments. The exemption is
available only if (1) the shares surrendered and those acquired in

exchange therefor evidence substantially the same rights and privileges
except that the shares surrendered may, in the discretion of the board
of directors, receive a lesser dividend than the shares for which they
are exchanged and (2) the transaction was effected in contemplation
of a public sale of the shares acquired in the exchange. This rule is
intended to relate only to the typical Class A and B common equity
securities.
Adoption of Rule 17a-8

During the fiscal year, the Commission adopted Rule 17a-B,I5 which
requires national securities exchanges to file reports of proposed rule
changes with the Commission prior to any final exchange adoption of
such changes. Under the Exchange Act the Commission has the
responsibility for overseeing the self-regulatory functions of national
securities exchanges. Under Sections 11, 19(b) and other sections of
the Act, the Commission has broad powers and responsibilities with
respect to the rules of such exchanges, including the power to alter or
supplement exchange rules in specified areas of exchange operations
and the power to enact its own rules in other areas if the exchanges'
rules are inadequate to protect investors and assure fair dealing.
Chapter XII of the Special Study Report concluded that the Commission's existing procedures for the review of exchange rules did not
appear to be sufficient to assure the needed continuous oversight on the
part of the Commission to enable it to discharge its responsibilities
under the Act. The Report recommended that the exchanges be
required to file all proposed rule changes with the Commission in
advance of effectiveness, as has always been required in the case of
rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Rule
17a-8 was adopted in response to that recommendation and is intended
to afford the Commission an adequate interval for orderly review of
new exchange rules or amendments before they become effective.
The rule provides that each national securities exchange shall file a
report of any proposed change in, or addition to, its rules not less than
3 weeks before it is submitted for any action by the membership or any
governing body of the exchange. If any substantive change is made
in the proposal after the report is filed with the Commission, a new
3-week notice is required unless the change is made to conform it to a
suggestion made by the Commission. The rule also provides that if
emergencies arise in which a report cannot be filed as provided above,
the exchange shall give the Commission as much advance notice as the
circumstances permit, together with a written statement of the reasons
why the filing of a report as required was impracticable.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Proposed Rule 17a-9

During the fiscal year, the Commission staff drafted a proposed rule
and related reporting forms requiring broker-dealers to report certain
information concerning over-the-counter trading in common stocks
traded on national securities exchanges. The proposed. rule, to be
designated Rule 17a-9, was published for public comment shortly
after the end of the fiscal year.16 It is intended to implement reoommendations of the Special Study of Securities Markets.
The Report of the Special Study describes a striking increase in the
volume of off-board trading in common stocks traded on the New York
Stock Exchange and other national securities exchanges in recent
years. But the Study found "an acute lack of data" concerning this
trading, which it described as the "third market." The Study recommended correction of this deficiency by establishment of a system for
the identification of market makers and for reporting information
concerning trading in this market.
The proposed rule and reporting forms are designed to enable the
Commission to obtain information on the third market on a continuous basis and thus keep abreast of any regulatory problems which may
develop therein. It would obtain two basic types of information:
(1) an identification of broker-dealers making off-board markets in
common stocks traded on any national securities exchange; and (2)
summaries of over-the-counter trading in common stocks traded. on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Proposed Amendments to Form 8-K

Form 8-K is prescribed for current reports filed pursuant to Sections 13 and 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act. During the 1962
fiscal year, the Commission announced that it had under consideration
certain proposed amendments to Form 8-K and invited public comments," The amendments are designed to bring to the attention of
investors prompt information regarding matters such as the pledging
of securities of the issuer or its affiliates under circumstances that a
default will result in a change in control of the issuer, changes in the
board of directors otherwise than by stockholder action, the acquisition or disposition of a significant amount of assets otherwise than in
the ordinary course of business, interests of management and others in
certain transactions, and the issuance of debt securities by subsidiaries.
These amendments were still under consideration at the close of the
last fiscal year.

Amendment of Rule 3e-3

During the fiscal year, the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed amendment of Rule 3c-3 under the Investment Company
Act,IS and, shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the rule was
amended."
Prior to its amendment, Rule 3c-3 exempted from the Act transactions of insurance companies with respect to group annuity contracts
entered into in connection with a plan of retirement which meets the
requirements of Sections 401 or 404(a) (2) of the Internal Revenue
Code and which provides for the allocation of part or all of the
employer's contributions to a separate account established and maintained pursuant to legislation under which income, gains and losses,
whether or not realized, from assets allocated to the account were credited to or charged against that account without regard to other income,
gains or losses of the insurance company." In order to qualify for the
exemption the group annuity contract was required to provide that
the retirement benefits for covered employees would be payable in
fixed dollar amounts, i.e., the contract could not permit the retirement
benefits payable to employees to reflect or be measured by the investment results of the assets allocated to the separate account.
The rule as amended permits group variable contracts to provide for
employees' retirement benefits to be payable in varying amounts but
the benefits may vary to the extent, and only to the extent, of the
employer's contributions to the separate account. No variable benefits
are permitted in respect of the contributions of the employees. In all
other respects, the restrictions and conditions of the rule remain intact.
Adoption of Rule 12d-1

During the fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed Rule 12d-1 under the Investment Company Act,21and after
the close of the fiscal year, the rule was adopted." Rule 12d-1 provides conditional exemptions from the provisions of Section 12( d) (3)
of the Act which prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or acquiring any security issued by, or any other interest in
the business of, a person who is a broker, a dealer, is engaged in the
business of underwriting, or is an investment adviser of an investment
company or an investment adviser registered under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The purpose of the rule is to permit registered investment companies, under specified circumstances, to retain in, or acquire for, their
portfolios securities of companies which are directly or indirectly
engaged in the businesses referred to in Section 12(d) (3), provided
that the portfolio companies are primarily and predominantly engaged in other businesses and derive or will derive a relatively insignificant portion of their gross revenues from such businesses.
The exemption is available for securities holdings or acquisitions of
securities by registered investment companies if the portfolio company,
during each of its most recent 3 .fiscal years, derived not more than
15 percent of its total gross revenues from the specified businesses, and
if the registered investment company and all companies under the
same or affiliated management as the registered company immediately
after the acquisition do not, in the aggregate, own more than 10 percent of the total outstanding voting stock of the portfolio company.
An exemption is also available for the purchase by a registered investment company of an unlimited percentage of the securities of a portfolio company if the portfolio company, during each of its most recent3 .fiscal years, has not derived more than 1 percent of its total gross
revenues from the businesses referred to in Section 12(d) (3) of the
Act.
A registered investment company which claims an exemption must
examine its portfolio semi-annually to determine whether its holdings
are in compliance with the conditions prescribed in the rule, and, if
any holding is not, the company is required to dispose of it within
90 days.
The rule further exempts all investments by registered investment
companies, without regard to the percentage of voting securities held,
in certain types of businesses, such as small loan, factoring and financecompanies which technically might be regarded as being engaged in
a securities business.
Amendment of Rule 17a-6

During the .fiscal year, the Commission amended Rule 17a-6 underthe Investment Company Act to provide certain additional exemptions from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) of the Act.23
Prior to its amendment, Rule 17a-6 exempted from the prohibitions
of paragraphs (1) and (3) of Section 17(a) of the Act the sale of
securities or other property to, and the borrowing of money or other
property from, a registered investment company which is a small business investment company licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (SBIC) where such transactions were prohibited

THIRTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

23

solely because the SBIC owns, controls, or holds with power to vote,
voting securities of a small business concern to an extent that creates
an affiliation within the meaning of the Act.
The purpose of both the previous rule and of the rule as amended is
to eliminate the need to file and process applications for exemption
from Section 17(a) in circumstances in which it appears that there is
no likelihood of overreaching of the investment company and that
the transaction would not be unreasonable or unfair to such company.
The rule as amended is broader in that it extends the exemption so as
to include not only transactions to which a registered investment company, which is an SBIC, is a party, but also transactions to which
another type of registered investment company (generally referred to
as a "venture capital investment company"), or a company controlled
by such a registered investment company, is a party. The rule now
specifies certain classes of persons who have an affiliation with the
registered investment company of a character which creates the possibility of overreaching of the investment company in a transaction
involving the registered investment company and such persons. An
exemption under the rule is not available, if such a person is a party
to the transaction, or has or within 6 months prior to the transaction
had, or pursuant to an arrangement will acquire, a direct or indirect
financial interest in a party (except the registered investment company) to the transaction.
The amended rule also exempts transactions involving a registered
investment company other than an SBIC or venture capital investment company and a company controlled by or affiliated with the registered investment company, if under the standards set forth in the preceding paragraph it appears that there is no likelihood of overreaching
of the investment company, and if all the outstanding securities of
the controlled or affiliated company are beneficially owned by not more
than 100 persons.
The rule as amended deletes the requirement of the original Rule
17a-6 that the pertinent details of each transaction for which exemption is claimed under the rule shall be reported by the investment company in its next annual report to stockholders and in a report filed
with the Commission within 30 days after the end of each semi-annual
accounting period of the investment company.
Amendment of Rule 17g-1

year, an amended rule was adopted," Rule 17g-1 requires that each
registered management investment company provide and maintain a
fidelity bond against larceny and embezzlement covering each officer
and employee of the investment company who may have access to securities or funds of the company.
The rule as amended adds to the provisions of the prior rule requirements that the amount of the :fidelity bond be determined at least once
each year, and that the registered company shall.file with the Commission a copy of each amendment to the bond, shall inform each of its
directors of any proposed cancellation, termination or modification
of the bond, and shall furnish to such directors and to the Commission
information as to the making and settlement of claims under the bond.
In addition, the amended rule requires that each bond must provide, in substance, that if the insurance company proposes to cancel,
terminate or modify the fidelity bond, it shall so notify the registered
company and the Commission not less than 30 days prior to the
effective date of such action.
The rule also places the obligation for .filing information with respect to the making and settlement of claims under fidelity bonds on
the registered company, rather than requiring, as originally proposed,
that the bond contain provisions pursuant to which the insurance
company would furnish the information to the Commission. The
adopted rule also provides that this information shall be nonpublic
unless the Commission determines to the contrary.
Proposed Amendment of Rule 20a-2

During the .fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on
a proposed amendment of Rule 20a-2.26 The rule presently requires
that a proxy statement relating to a registered investment company
include certain information with respect to, among other things, the
investment advisory contract, ownership and control of the investment
adviser, and interests of the management of the investment company
in the investment adviser. Except where the investment adviser is
a bank, a balance sheet of the investment adviser must be included,
unless the Commission, for good cause, permits the omission of such
balance sheet. Certain information also is required with respect to
the relationship between the investment company or the investment
adviser and the principal underwriter of the investment company's
securities. Where action is to be taken by the security holders of
the investment company with respect to an investment advisory contract, information is also to be included with respect to such contract

and with respect to certain collateral arrangements or understandings
in connection therewith.
The effect of the proposed revision of Rule 20a-2 would be to require: (1) disclosure of information with respect to the principal
underwriter, the prospective principal underwriter and the principal
underwriting contract comparable to that now required with respect
to the investment adviser, the prospective investment adviser and the
investment advisory contract; (2) disclosure of certain financial information concerning (a) the investment company, (b) the investment advisory contract where action is to be taken by security holders
with respect thereto, and (c) the principal underwriting contract
where action is to be taken by security holders with respect thereto;
and (3) the inclusion of such financial information with respect to
both the investment advisory contract and the principal underwriting
contract if action is to be taken by security holders with respect to
either and the investment adviser and principal underwriter are the
same person or one is an affiliated person of, or an affiliated person of
an affiliated person of, the other.
This matter was pending at the close of the£scal year.

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is primarily a disclosure statute designed

to provide investors with material facts concerning securities publicly
offered for sale by an issuing company or any person in a control
relationship to such company by the use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit,
or other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities generally. Disclosure is obtained by requiring the issuer of such securities to file
with the Commission a registration statement which includes a prospectus containing significant financial and other information about
the issuer and the offering. The registration statement is available
for public inspection as soon as it is filed. Although the securities
may be offered for sale after the registration statement has been filed,
sales may not be made until the registration statement has become
"effective." A copy of the prospectus must be furnished to each purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of the security in order that
he may have the opportunity to evaluate the securities and make an
informed investment decision. The registrant and the underwriter
are basically responsible for the contents of the registration statement.
The Commission has no authority to control the nature or quality
of a security to be offered for public sale or to pass upon its merits
or the terms of its distribution. Its action in permitting a registration statement to become effective does not constitute approval of the
securities, and any representation to the contrary to a prospective
purchaser of securities is made unlawful by Section 23 of the Act.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may be
effected by filing with the Commission a registration statement on the
applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. Generally speaking, when a registration statement relates to a security issued by a
corporation or other private issuer, it must contain the information,
and be accompanied by the documents, specified in Schedule A of the
Act; when it relates to a security issued by a foreign government, the
material specified in Schedule B must be supplied. Both schedules
specify in considerable detail the disclosure which should be made
26

THIRTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

27

available to an investor in order that he may make a realistic appraisal of the company and the securities and thus exercise an informed
judgment whether to buy the security. In addition, the Act provides
flexibility in its administration by empowering the Commission to
classify issues, issuers and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms,
and to increase, or in certain instances vary or diminish, the particular
items of information required to be disclosed in the registration statement as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors. The Commission has prepared special
registration forms which vary in their disclosure requirements so as
to provide maximum disclosure of the essential facts pertinent in a
given type of offering while at the same time minimizing the burden
and expense of compliance with the law.
In general, the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must describe such matters as the names of persons
who participate in the direction, management, or control of the
issuer's business; their security holdings and remuneration and the
options or bonus and profit-sharing privileges allotted to them; the
character and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure,
past history and earnings, and its financial statements, certified by
independent accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made within 2 years or intended to be made; the interest of
directors, officersand principal stockholders in material transactions;
pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purposes to which the
proceeds of the offering are to be applied. The prospectus constitutes
a part of the registration statement and presents the more important
of the required disclosures.
Examination

Procedure

Registration statements are examined by the staff of the Division
of Corporation Finance for compliance with the standards of accurate
and full disclosure. The registrant is usually notified by an informal
letter of comment of any material respects in which the statement
appears to fail to conform with the applicable requirements and is
afforded an opportunity to file correcting or clarifying amendments.
In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement if it finds that material representations are misleading, inaccurate or incomplete. In certain cases, such as where the
deficiencies in a registration statement appear to stem from careless
disregard of applicable requirements or from a deliberate attempt to
conceal or mislead, a letter of comment is generally not sent and the
Commission either institutes an investigation to determine whether

28

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

"stop-order" proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes
such proceedings. Information about the use of the "stop-order"
power during 1964 appears below under "Stop-Order Proceedings."
Time Required to Complete Registration

The Commission's staff endeavors to complete its examination of
registration statements in as short a time as possible. The Act provides that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th
day after it is filed (or on the 20th day after the filing of any amendment thereto).
Since most registration statements require one or
more amendments, they usually do not become effective until some
time after the original 20-day period. The period between filing and
effective date is intended to afford investors an opportunity to become
familiar with the proposed offering through the dissemination of the
preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission is empowered to
accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period
where the facts justify such action. In exercising this power, the
Commission is required to take into account the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, the
ease with which the facts about the new offering can be disseminated
and understood, and the public interest and the protection of investors.
The note to Rule 460 under the Act indicates, for the information of
interested persons, some of the more common situations in which the
Commission considers that the statute generally requires it to deny
acceleration of the effective date of a registration statement.
The median number of calendar days which elapsed from the date of
original filing to the effective date with respect to the 960 registration
statements that became effective during the 1964 fiscal year 1 was 36,
compared with 52 days for 985 registration statements in fiscal year
1963 and 78 days for 1,646 registration statements in fical year 1962.
The number of registration statements filed during fiscal year 1964
was 1,192, as compared with 1,159 and 2,307 in fiscal years 1963 and
1962, respectively,"
The following table shows by months during the 1964 fiscal year the
number of calendar days elapsed during each of the three principal
stages of the registration process for the median registration statement, the total elapsed time and the number of registration statements
effective.

VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

During the fiscal year 1964, a total of 1,121 registrations of securities in the amount of $16.9 billion became effective under the Securities Act of 1933. These figures represent a decrease of 3 percent
in the number of statements, but an increase of 14 percent in dollar
amount of registrations over the preceding fiscal year. The chart on
page '7 shows the number and dollar amounts of reg-istrations from
1935 to 1964.
These figures cover all registrations which became effective, including secondary distributions and securities registered for other than
cash sale, such as issues exchanged for other securities, and securities
reserved for conversion. Of the dollar amount of securities registered
in 1964, nearly 88 percent was for account of issuer for cash sale, over
3 percent for account of issuer for other than cash sale, and 9 percent
for account of others, as shown below.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The $14.8 billion of securities offered for cash sale for account of
issuer represented an increase of $2.9 billion, or 25 percent, over the
previous year. Registration of new common stock issues aggregated
$10 billion, $2.8 billion more than in the 1963 fiscal period. The
increase in common stock registered largely reflected a $1.2 billion
issue offered to stockholders by .American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
(a record-size issue) and a $200 million issue of the Communications
Satellite Corporation, as well as increased registrations of investment
company issues and stock options. Registrations of new bonds, notes
and debentures were only slightly higher than in the preceding year,
and accounted for $4.6 billion of the 1964 volume. Preferred stock
issues registered for account of the issuer amounted to $224 million,
somewhat lower than in 1963. Appendix Table 1 shows the number
of statements which became effective and total amounts registered for
each of the fiscal years 1935 through 1964, and contains a classification,
by type of security, of issues to be offered for cash sale on behalf of the
issuer during those years. More detailed information for 1964 is
given in Appendix Table 2.
Corporate issues to be offered immediately after effective registration amounted to $6.5 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the
previous year. Of the total, communication companies accounted for
$2.2 billion of issues, including the two issues mentioned above. A
larger amount was also registered by companies in the financial and
real estate group, the total being $1 billion, almost double the amount
of the preceding year. Among the other major industry groups,
electric, gas and water companies registered $2.1 billion of securities,
slightly under the 1963 total, and manufacturing companies registered
over $900 million of issues, a moderately higher amount than in the
preceding year. Registration of foreign government issues scheduled
for immediate sale decreased to $120 million from $265 million in the
preceding year, but in addition, one foreign government issue in the
amount of $400 million, planned for offering on a continuous basis
over a number of years, was effectively registered.

has lifted the stop order.

Three of the proceedings which were terminated during the fiscal
year through the issuance of stop orders are described below:
Advanced Research Associates, Inc-s-In this proceeding, the Commission held that the company's prospectus was highly misleading
and denied a request for withdrawal of the registration statement.
The Commission found that despite certain caveats, the description of
the issuer's business in the prospectus created a misleading impression
of a company on the verge of major expansion and successful operation in the advanced electronic field in aviation, when in fact it had
sustained substantial losses in its short history and future prospects
were at best doubtful. The Commission pointed out, in this connection, that statements may be so distorted that no disclosure or caveat
is sufficient to cure their misleading nature. The Commission also
found a number of other deficiencies, including a misleading description of one of the company's products, a "Composite Transistor;" the
failure to disclose that prior sales of the company's securities, claimed
to have been made in reliance on certain exemptions from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, were in fact not exempt and
violated those provisions, thereby giving rise to contingent liabilities;
and a false statement that the certifying accountant was independent.
The Commission's conclusion that the accountant was not independent
with respect to the issuer was based on the fact that there had been a
number of transactions and associations between him and two of the

issuer's principals or companies 'in which they had a controlling or
substantial interest.
Atlantic Research Corporation.4-The registrant, a Virginia corporation incorporated in January 1949, maintains its principal offices
at Alexandria, Virginia, and has operations at various locations
throughout the country. It is engaged primarily in research, development and manufacture in the field of solid propellant rockets. A large
portion of its sales is generated pursuant to contracts and subcontracts
for the United States Government. On July 31, 1962, registrant filed
8 registration statement covering a proposed offering of 179,000shares
of common stock for the account of certain stockholders.
Information developed by the Commission's staff in an investigation led to a suspension of trading in registrant's stock on October 10,
1962, because of serious questions as to the adequacy and accuracy of
information available to the public concerning the financial condition
of registrant. More specifically, unconsolidated financial statements
contained in registrant's annual report to stockholders for the year
ended December 31, 1961, reported profits on a parent only basis in the
amount of $1,473,192. Registrant filed reports with the Commission
covering the same period which showed a loss in the amount of
$1,066,015 on a consolidated basis.
Following the Commission's institution of stop order proceedings on
November 7, 1962, registrant entered into a stipulation in which it
waived a hearing and post-hearing procedures, and agreed that the
registration statement was inadequate and inaccurate in certain
respects and that the Commission might enter a stop order.
The Commission held that the registration statement was "marked
by numerous serious and substantial deficiencies" which "reflected a
studied pattern of corporate camouflage and concealment and of artificial market activities, all designed to present to investors and others
a fictitious picture of registrant's activities and finances," and it issued
a. stop order. One of the principal deficiencies related to the failure
to disclose registrant's relationships with certain "satellite" corporations. According to the opinion, registrant directed and completely
dominated the management. policies and activities of these companies,
which had no business activities of their own and were operated
together with registrant as one economic unit. The failure to disclose
these relationships resulted in the concealment of material aspects of
registrant's financial affairs and business operations. Moreover, the
Commission held, these satellites were in fact subsidiaries of registrant, and their financial statements should have been consolidated
with those of registrant .

The Commission further found that the registration statement failed
-to disclose the true facts concerning the relationships between members of the management of registrant and certain landlord and other
companies, and the interests of such persons in transactions to which
registrant or its subsidiaries were parties. Disclosure in these respects
would have raised further questions concerning the reliability of the

registration statement failed to disclose the commitment of substantial
amounts of registrant's capital to the acquisition of its own stock in
the open market at a critical period in the market, for the purpose
and with the effect of manipulating the market price and protecting
the pledge by registrant's chief executive of his stock.
South Bay Industries, Inc.5-Registrant
was incorporated in Delaware on August 3, 1959, for the purpose of acquiring 100 percent of
the stock of two affiliated California corporations which were engaged
principally in manufacturing ground handling equipment for aircraft
and guided missiles. On December 11, 1959, it filed a registration
statement covering a proposed offering of 210,000 shares of Class A
common stock at $5 per share. The registration statement became
effective on March 23, 1960, and the offering was completed shortly
thereafter.
On the basis of a stipulation of facts, the Commission found that the
registration statement was materially deficient in failing to disclose
current adverse financial information subsequent to the date of the
most recent financial statements in the registration statement.
A trial
balance prepared prior to the effective date indicated a substantial loss
for one of the subsidiaries for its latest fiscal year. Under the circumstances, the Commission stated, registrant should at least have deferred
the effective date of the registration statement until the imminent final
audit figures were available. The Commission further found that
, even aside from the trial balance, registrant's president, the underwriter, and the certifying accountant were on notice prior to the effective date that the figures in the registration statement were out of date
and that the registration statement gave no indication of registrant's
subsequent adverse financial condition.
The Commission also found, among a number of other deficiencies,
that the accountant who certified certain financial statements in the
registration statement was not in fact independent with respect to
registrant since, among other things, he and registrant's president were
. business associates in another, closely held company, and his conduct
in permitting his certification to appear in the registration statement

EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by Section 8 (e) of the Act to make an
examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding
should be instituted under Section 8(d).
For this purpose the Commission is empowered to examine witnesses and require the production
of pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized by Section 20(a) of the Act to make an investigation to determine whether
any provision of the Act or of any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder has been or is about to be violated. Inappropriate cases, investigations are instituted under this Section as an expeditious means of
determining whether a registration statement is false or misleading
or omits to state any material fact. The following table indicates

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES

The Commission is authorized under Section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such
terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities
from registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by
reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of $300,000
upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by the Commission
in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority, the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations:
Rule 234: Exemption of first lien notes.
Rule 235: Exemption of securities of cooperative housing corporations.
Rule 236: Exemption of shares offered in connection with certain transactions.
Regulation A: General exemption for United States and Canadian issues
up to $300,000.

37

Regulation B: Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or
gas rights up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for
assessable stock offered or sold to realize the amount of assessment
thereon.

Under Section 3 (c) of the Securities Act, which was added by Section 307 (a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting securities issued by a company which is operating or proposes to operate as
a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission has
adopted a Regulation E which exempts upon certain terms and conditions limited amounts of securities issued by any small business
investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This regulation is substantially similar to the one
provided by Regulation A adopted under Section 3 (b) of the Act.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the
Act does not carry any exemption from the provisions of the Act prohibiting fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities and imposing civil liability or criminal responsibilty for such conduct.
Exempt O1lerings Under Regulation A

The Commission's Regulation A implements Section 3 (b) of the
Securities Act of 1933 and permits a company to obtain needed capital
not in excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in
anyone year from a public offering of its securities without registration, if the company complies with the regulation.
Upon complying
with the regulation a company is exempt from the registration provisions of the Act. A Regulation A filing consists of a notification
supplying basic information about the company, certain exhibits, and
an offering circular which must be used in offering the securities.
However, in the case of a company with an earnings history which is
making an offering not in excess of $50,000 an offering circular need
not be used. A notification is filed with the Regional Office of the
Commission in the region in which the company has its principal place
of business.
During the 1964 fiscal year, 462 notifications were filed under Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $89,317,615, compared with
517 notifications covering proposed offerings of $101,040,982 in the
1963 fiscal year. Included in the 1964 total were 26 notifications covering stock offerings of $3,729,642 with respect to companies engaged
in the exploratory oil and gas business, 11 notifications covering offerings of $2,734,530 by mining companies and 22 notifications covering

Suspension of Exemption

Regulation .A. provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for
which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is
not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation
'Or with prescribed disclosure standards. Following the issuance of
a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the respondents
may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension
should be vacated or made permanent. If no hearing is requested
within 30 days after the entry of the temporary suspension order and
none is ordered by the Commission on its own motion, the temporary
suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1964 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were issued
in 35 cases, which, added to the 2'7 cases pending at the beginning of
the fiscal year, resulted in a total of 62 cases for disposition. Of these,
the temporary suspension order was vacated in 8 cases and became
permanent in 35: in 18 by Iapse of time, in 6 by withdrawal of the
request for hearing, and in 11 after hearing. Thus, there were 19 cases
pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Three of the cases disposed of during the year are summarized below
to illustrate the type of misrepresentations and other noncompliance
with the regulation which led to the issuance of suspension orders:

customers (the Dean group) purchased a 50 percent interest in the
issuer for $20,000. Shares representing this interest were issued to
the attorney for the Dean group as holder of record and nominee for
the group. However, the issuer's offering circular and notification
listed the attorney as both beneficial and record holder of these shares.
This procedure was claimed to be in the issuer's interest because its
potential customers included competitors of the Dean group and it
was felt a sales problem might be created if it were publicized that the
Dean group were the major stockholders of the issuer.
The Commission, in its order permanently suspending the Regulation A exemption," stated that: "Even though the issuance of the Dean
group stock in the name of a nominee for the beneficial owners may
originally have been motivated by factors considered to be in the best
interests of Trail-Aire, when the issuer undertook to make a publie
offering of its securities, disclosure of the facts as to the true beneficial owners of controlling blocks of stock was necessary. Particularly where such owners are the issuer's principal customers, the possibility exists that the issuer may conduct its affairs in a manner to
serve their interests and to subordinate the other aspects of its business."
The Commission further stated that although there was no evidence
indicating an intent to subvert the issuer's interests as a whole, the
possibility of conflict was of vital interest to public investors, and
they had a right to a full presentation of facts which indicated its
presence and extent. The Commission concluded that the issuer's
officers "exhibited a lack of concern for the complete truth and accuracy of the material filed and used, which is incompatible with the
responsibilities of those who seek to avail themselves of the conditional
exemption provided by Regulation A."
Northeast Telecommunications, Inc.-In its Opinion and Order
permanently suspending issuer's exemption/ the Commission held,
among other things, that no.exemption.under.Begulation A.. was available because the $300,000 statutory limitation was exceeded. While
the offering consisted of 300,000shares at $1 a share, under the regulation 22,000 shares previously issued or sold had to be included in. determining the aggregate offering price. These included 10,000 shares
owned by officers and directors which had been placed. in escrow, but
which, pursuant to instructions from the issuer's president, were transferred by the escrow agent to a nominee of the underwriter 7 months
prior to termination of the escrow agreement. The Commission stated
that "where, as here, the president of an issuer participates with the
• Securities Act Release No. 4621 (July S. 1968).
~ Securities Act Release No. 4622 (July 17, 1963).

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

escrow agent in a breach of an escrow agreement the issuer cannot
properly claim that 'effective' provision was made (as required by
the regulation) to keep the stock in escrow. Moreover, it is immaterial that the underwriter did not sell the 10,000 shares until after the
termination of the escrow agreement." The Commission also held that
12,000 shares sold in violation of the registration provisions of the
Securities A.ct within 1 year prior to commencement of the Regulation
A. offering must be included in determining the aggregate offering
price.
Decorative Interiors, Inc.-The
issuer offered its securities on a
best efforts basis through an underwriter who was a sole proprietor
whom it knew to be young, inexperienced, and financially irresponsible. When the Commission's staff began to inquire into the offering,
questions were put to the underwriter, which he refused to answer and
as to which he invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. The
Commission then issued a temporary suspension order, based on Rule
261 (a) (7) which provides that an exemption may be suspended whereever "the issuer or any promoter, officer, director, or underwriter has
failed to cooperate or has obstructed or refused to permit the making
of an investigation by the Commission." At the hearing the issuer
maintained that it had not been a party to the underwriter's failure
to cooperate and asked for leave to substitute a new underwriter or to
withdraw its filing. The Commission rejected the issuer's requests,
held that the suspension must be made permanent, and said in its

opinion ;"
Since the offering was on a best efforts basis and the issuer did not intend to
return any proceedsto investors if all the shares to be offered were not sold, the
experience and responsibility of the underwriter were particularly important
... Under these circumstances, we think the issuer assumed whatever risks
resulted from its action in employingthis underwriter as its agent for the public
sale of its securities. We think the record sbows not only a lack of reasonable
care on the part of the issuer in arranging for the selection of the underwriter
and the terms of the offering, bnt also a failure to beed clear warnings of the
underwriter's lack of responsibility and reliability.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 for securities of small business investment companies which are licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 or which have received the preliminary approval
of the Small Business Administration and have been notified by the
Administration that they may submit an application for such a license.
The regulation, which is similar in many respects to the general
exemption provided by Regulation A, requires the filing of a notification with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings not in
excess of $50,000, the filing and use of an offering circular containing
certain specified information.
Regulation E provides for the suspension of exemption in particular
cases if the Commission finds that any of the terms and conditions
of the regulation have not been met or complied with.
There were no filings under Regulation E during the 1964 fiscal
year.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act for assessments levied upon assessable stock and for
deliquent assessment sales in amounts not exceeding $300,000 in any
one year. It requires the filing of a simple notification giving brief
information with respect to the issuer, its management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security issues.
The regulation requires a company to send to its stockholders, or
otherwise publish, a statement of the purposes for which the proceeds
from the assessment are proposed to be used. If the issuer should employ any other sales literature in connection with the assessment, copies
of such literature must be filed with the Commission.
During the 1964 fiscal year, 28 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $835,623. Regulation F notifications
were filed in three of the nine regional offices of the Commission:
Denver, San Francisco and Seattle. Underwriters were not employed
in any of the Regulation F assessments.
Regulation F provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder, as in Regulation A, where the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the regulation or in accordance with prescribed disclosure standards.
No Regulation F filings were temporarily suspended during the
fiscal year 1964.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Securities
Acts Amendments of 1964 (enacted on August 20, 1964), provides for
the registration and regulation of securities exchanges, the registration of securities listed on such exchanges, and under new Section
12(g), the registration of securities traded over the counter whose
issuers have total assets in excess of $1 million and a class of equity
securities held of record by at least 750 persons (after July 1, 1966,
the number will be reduced to 500). It establishes, for issuers of
securities registered under the Act, financial and other reporting
requirements, regulation of proxy solicitations and requirements with
respect to trading by directors, officersand principal security holders.
The Act also provides for the registration and regulation of national
securities associations and of brokers and dealers doing business in the
over-the-counter market, contains provisions designed to prevent
fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the use of credit in securities transactions. The purpose of these statutory requirements is to ensure the
maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions
on the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Four exchanges were exempted from registration by the Commission
pursuant to Section 5 of the Act:
Colorado Springs Stock Exchange
Honolulu Stock Exchange

Richmond Stock Exchange
Wheeling Stock Exchange

Exchange Disciplinary Action

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against any member, member firm, or person
connected therewith, for violation of any rule of the exchange, of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or of any rule or regulation thereunder. During the fiscal year 9 of the 18 exchanges reported 121 such
actions, including imposition of fines ranging from $50 to $17,500 in
46 cases, with total fines aggregating $63,000; the suspension from
membership of 17 individuals and 7 member organizations; the expulsion of 6 individual members and 3 member organizations; and censures of 59 member organizations and individuals. Various other
sanctions were imposed against registered representatives and other
employees of member firms including the required re-examination of
a number of prospective employees of member organizations.
Commission Inspections of the Exchanges

The Commission is charged with the responsibility for the oversight of the national securities exchanges. In carrying out its duties
in this regard and as part of its expanding program in this area, 9
inspections of the New York and American Stock Exchanges were
made during the fiscal year. The major areas inspected included the
exchange regulatory programs with regard to the financial responsibility of member firms; disciplinary actions; floor surveillance; and
the handling of public complaints. In addition, general inspections
were made of the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, Midwest Stock Exchange and Spokane Stock Exchange.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

Unless a security is registered on a national securities exchange
under the Securities Exchange Act or is exempt. from such registration it is unlawful for a member of such exchange or any broker or
dealer to effect any transaction in the security on the exchange. In
general, the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a state or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions
or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and
regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission may
find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for

THIRTIETH

the protection of investors. Under this authority the Commission has
exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by
property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary
basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to listed
securities.
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. Information must be furnished
regarding the issuer's business, its capital structure, the terms of its
securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, and the allotment of options,
bonuses and proft-sharing plans, and financial statements certified
by independent accountants must be filed as part of the application.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit and
securities of foreign governments.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration.
These periodic reports
include annual reports, semi-annual reports, and current reports. The
principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is designed to keep
up-to-date the information furnished in applications filed on Form
10. Semi-annual reports required to be furnished on Form 9-K are
devoted chiefly to furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form 8-K are required to be filed for each month in which
any of certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form
deals with matters such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination
of important legal proceedings and important changes in the issuer's
capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding. Under the
1964: Securities Acts Amendments, the above requirements will be
applicable to issuers registered under new Section 12(g).
The following table shows the number of reports filed during the
fiscal year pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act and those filed
under Section 15(d) of the Act by issuers obligated to file reports by
reason of having publicly offered securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933. As of June 30, 1964:,there were 2,930 such issuers,
including 290 that were also registered as investment companies under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. The table also includes the

The number of foreign stocks on the exchanges has declined somewhat in recent years, owing principally to a reduction on the American
Stock Exchange from 152 in 1956 to 106 in 1963. Trading in foreign
stocks on the American Stock Exchange has fallen from 42.4 percent
of the reported share volume in 1956, to 14.9 percent in 1963. Trading
in foreign stocks on the New York Stock Exchange represented 3.4
percent of its reported share volume in 1956, and about 2 percent in
1l:>63.
Reported volumes in foreign shares during calendar year 1963 included about 31 million Canadian and 16 million other foreign shares
on the American Stock Exchange and about 10 million Canadian and
13 million at her foreign shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the share volume on the American exceeded that on the New
York Stock Exchange, it would appear that in view of higher average
share prices, the latter exchange had a greater dollar volume in foreign
shares.
Comparative Exchange Statistics

In recent years, the number of stocks listed on the New York Stock
Exchange has increased moderately, while the aggregate number of
stocks available for trading exclusively on the other exchanges has
declined, On the American Stock Exchange there has been a small
loss of issues since 1962.

ANNUAL REPORT

Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act. During the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1964, the Commission granted applications by exchanges and issuers to remove 56 stock issues and 24 bond issues from
listing and registration.
Since 3 stocks were each delisted by two
exchanges, there was a total of 59 stock removals. The number of

In accordance with the practice in recent years, nearly all of the
delisting applications were filed by exchanges. The two applications
granted issuers during the year removed from the American Stock
Exchange a Canadian stock with little trading volume and the stock
of a domestic company which had incurred substantial losses.
The New York Stock Exchange delisted 21 bonds and debentures of
German state, municipal and corporate issuers. On March 25, 1964,
the Exchange adopted new delisting rules and criteria with respect to
lack of earnings, limited distribution of securities and insufficient
market value of outstanding stock and publicly held shares.
Delisting and Trading Suspension Proceedings Under Section 19(a)

Section 19(a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a period
not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw, the registration of a security
on a national securities exchange if, in its opinion, such action is
necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that the
issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the
Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Of the two proceedings
under Section 19(a) (2) pending at the beginning of the fiscal year,
one was terminated during the year, and no additional proceedings
were instituted during the year.

52

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In Precision Microwave Oorporation 1 the Commission found that a.
Securities Act registration statement, incorporated by reference in the
issuer's application for registration of its common stock on the American Stock Exchange, contained false and misleading financial information, including a material understatement of liability for sales commissions, a material overstatement of work-in-process, and distorted
comparative sales and earnings figures. It further found that the
accountant's certificate was false and misleading because he did not
follow generally accepted auditing procedures and was not in fact
independent, having employed the office manager and accountant of
the issuer's major subsidiary, who was responsible for maintenance of
books and records reviewed during the audit, to assist him in the audit.
The issuer had subsequently filed and submitted to stockholders an
annual report for a more recent period which included financial statements audited by different accountants, but thereafter receivership
proceedings and proceedings under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act
had been instituted with respect to the issuer, following which required
reports were not filed. The Commission (in addition to issuing a.
stop order with respect to the registration statement) concluded to
suspend the exchange registration of the stock for 60 days, with the
proviso that if within 30 days the issuer filed reports containing correct
up-to-date financial information and disclosing the status of the court
proceedings and the extent of the present holdings and relationship to
the issuer of the official principally responsible for the falsification of
the financial information, and such reports presented II satisfactory
basis for permitting the resumption of trading, the suspension would
be terminated, but otherwise the exchange registration would be withdrawn. No reports were filed by the company and the registration of
its stock was withdrawn."
Section 19(a) (4) authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend
trading in any registered security on a national securities exchange
for a period not exceeding 10 days if, in its opinion, such action is
necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and the public
interest so requires. During the 1964 fiscal year the Commission used
this authority with respect to three companies. At the end of the
fiscal year two suspensions remained in effect. A new Section 15 (c) (5)
enacted as part of the 1964 amendments provides the Commission
with authority summarily to suspend over-the-counter trading in any
security for a period not exceeding 10 days if, in its opinion, the public
interest and protection of investors so require.

UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES

Stocks with unlisted trading privileges which are not also listed and
registered on other exchanges continued to decline in number, from
168 on June 30, 1963 to 140 on June 30, 1964. The American Stock
Exchange accounted for 24 of the 28 removals. The balance of the
removals were accounted for by the Chicago Board of Trade, the
Honolulu Stock Exchange, and the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
The distribution of unlisted stocks and share volumes therein among
the exchanges is shown in appendix table 8. The statutory provisions
regarding unlisted trading were amended in several respects after the
close of the fiscal year by the Securities Acts Amendments of 1964.
The reported volume of trading on the exchanges in stock with only
unlisted trading privileges for the calendar year 1963, was about
20,121,000 shares or about 1.1 percent of the total share volume on all
the exchanges. About 93 percent of this volume was on the American
Stock Exchange while three other exchanges contributed the remaining
7 percent. The share volume in these stocks on the American Stock
Exchange represented 5.6 percent of the total share volume on that
Exchange.
Unlisted trading privileges on exchanges in stocks listed and registered on other exchanges numbered 1,637 on June 30, 1964. The
volume of unlisted trading in these stocks, for the calendar year H)63,
was reported at about 62,258,000 shares. About 15 percent of this
volume was on the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on regional exchanges, and about 85 percent was on the regional exchanges
in stocks listed on the New York or American Stock Exchanges.
While the 62,258,000shares amounted to less than 4 percent of the total
share volume on all the exchanges, they constituted substantial portions of the share volumes on the leading regional exchanges, as reflected in the following approximate percentages: Boston 79 percent;
Philadel phia- Baltimore-Washington 72 percent; Cincinnati 68 percent; Detroit 61 percent; Pittsburgh 54 percent; Midwest 32 percent;
and Pacific Coast Stock Exchange 32 percent.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, filed pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section
12(f) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the Commission
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1964, as follows:

BLOCK DISTRIBUTIONS

REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large for the auction market on the floor of an exchange is to
resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the close of
exchange trading.
Secondary distributions, as reported since 194:2,
reached a peak of $926,514,294 during the calendar year 1961, and
totaled $814,983,600 during 1963. During the first 6 months of 1964
there were 71 secondary distributions aggregating $698,667,735 or 85.7
percent of the total for the entire year 1963.
In an effort to keep as much as possible of block business on their
floors, Special Offering Plans were adopted by leading exchanges commencing in 1942, and the somewhat more flexible Exchange Distribution Plans commencing in 1953. Special offerings have virtually disappeared, while the number of Exchange distributions has grown.
The largest number of Special offerings was 87 in 1944, with $32,454,000
aggregate value. In 1962, there were only 2 offerings and in 1963,
there were none. In 1963, there were 72 Exchange distributions with
a total value of $107,498,026, a new high both in number and value.

1963, approximately 4,400 stocks of domestic issuers with 300 holders
or more, possessing an aggregate value of about $98.8 billion, which
were quoted only in the over-the-counter market. They included
$26.7 billion in bank stocks, $25.3 billion in insurance stocks, and $46.8
billion in industrial, utility, and other miscellaneous stocks. The

In addition to the stocks mentioned above, there is a large number
of actively quoted stocks of companies whose coverage by the standard
securities manuals is generally limited to brief announcements of the
circumstances of the offerings. Their number was in excess of 1,000
on December 31, 1963, at which time they constituted about 29 percent of the actively quoted stocks in the National Quotation Bureau
services. These stocks may be presumed to have over 300 holders
each. In addition, there is an indeterminate number of stocks with
over 300 holders for the most part issued by small companies, which
are inactively quoted or not publicly quoted. As far as can be ascertained, they are for the most part stocks of small companies.

About half of the stocks show substantial concentration of dealer

quoted only on the bid side, indicating sporadic dealings. Some are
listed on domestic or Canadian stock exchanges.
Reporting Under Section 15(d)

Issuers reporting pursuant to Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act continued to increase in number notwithstanding the numerous reductions occasioned by listing on the exchanges or absorption
into other companies by purchase of assets or mergers. The number
of such issuers increased from 2,647 on December 31,1962 to 2,730 on
December 31, 1963. The issued stock of 1,823 of these companies had
a $39.2 billion aggregate market value at the end of 1963. The remaining 907 issuers included partnerships, voting trusts duplicative
of listed shares, stock purchase and employees savings plans, companies with only bonds in public hands, registered investment companies, and numerous issuers for whose shares no quotation was available, including a considerable number registering in 1963, but not
offering their shares until 1964.
As amended by the 1964 Amendments, Section 15(d) no longer requires registration statements filed under the Securities Act to contain an undertaking to comply with the reporting requirements of
Section 13 of the Exchange Act under certain circumstances. That
Section now automatically requires issuers filing registration statements to file reports under the Exchange Act during the year a registration statement becomes effective and thereafter if they have 300 or
more security holders. Issuers required to register under Section
12(g) will be required to file reports by virtue of being so registered.

MANIPULATION

AND STABILIZATION

Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance regarding the trading volume or market for a security; a
series of transactions creating actual or apparent active trading in
a security or raising or depressing its price, for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of such security by others; circulation of information concerning market operations conducted for a rise or a decline
in the price of a security; and the making of any materially false or
misleading statement regarding a security for the purpose of inducing
purchases or sales. The Act also empowers the Commission to adopt
rules and regulations to define and prohibit the use of these and other
forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on an exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff observes the tickertape
quotations of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
on the American Stock Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets of
the various regional exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published
by the National Daily Quotation Service for about 6,000 unlisted securities to observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or
market activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and
various financial publications and statistical services are also closely
followed.
In order to simplify recordkeeping and for other reasons it was
decided that as of December 31, 1963, the "quiz" type of trading investigations would be discontinued and such cases assigned a standard

58

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE CO:MMISSION

case number. Such investigations are, and hereafter will be, included
in the table entitled "Investigations of possible violations of the Acts
administered by the Commission," which will be found under the
heading COMPLAINTS
ANDINVESTIGATIONS
in Part XI of this Report.
However, 54 trading quizzes were pending at the end of the 1963 fiscal
year, and 36 others were initiated prior to the change in policy, making a total of 90 such quizzes open at some time during the fiscal year.
Only 35 of these remained open at the end of the fiscal year, 39 having
been closed and 16 converted into investigations.
IVhen a public distribution of securities is to be made. the markets
in such securities are also closely watched to make sure that the price
is not unlawfully raised prior to or during the distribution.
During
the fiscal year, 1,121 registered offerings, with a total offering price
of $16.9 billion, and 462 offerings exempt from registration under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, with a total offering price of $89 million, were so observed. In addition, 232 other offerings, such as secondary distributions and distributions of securities under various
plans filed by the exchanges, with a total offering price of $1,284 million were also kept under surveillance.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution.
It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the restrictions provided by the Commission's Rules 10b-6, 7 and 8. These
rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for
the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent unlawful manipulation.
During fiscal year 1964 stabilizing was effected in connection with
stock offerings totaling 38,358,692 shares having an aggregate public
offering price of $1,397,159,991 and bond offerings having a total
offering price of $235,434,000. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted in the purchase of 788,712 shares at a cost of $27,972,490 and bonds at a cost of $2,837,165. In connection with these
stabilizing transactions, 6,483 stabilizing reports, showing purchases
and sales of securities effected by persons conducting the distribution ..
were received and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOLDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act is designed to prevent
the unfair use of information by directors, officers and principal stockholders by giving publicity to their security holdings and transactions.

TEITRTIETH )L~AL

and by removing the profit incentive in short-term trading by them in
securities of their company. Such persons by virtue of their position
may have knowledge of the company's condition and prospects which
is unavailable to the general public and be able to use such information
to their personal advantage in transactions in the company's securities.
Provisions similar to those contained in Section 16 of the Act are also
contained in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of IV35 and Section 30 of the Investment Company Act of IV40.
Ownership Reports

Section 16(a), as it read during the fiscal year, required every person
who was a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent
of any class of any equity security (other than an exempted security)
which was registered on a national securities exchange, or who was a
director or officer of the issuer of such securities, to file reports with
the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of the
issuer's equity securities, and to keep such information current.
After the close of the fiscal year, the Securities Acts Amendments
of IV64 expanded the scope of Section 16 so as to apply to insiders connected with issuers which are required by Section 12 (g) to register
securities traded over the counter with the Commission.
All ownership reports are available for public inspection as soon
as they are filed at the Commission's office in Washington and those
relating to securities registered on an exchange may also be inspected
at the exchanges where copies of such reports are filed. In addition,
for the purpose of making the reported information available to
interested persons who may not be able to inspect the reports in person,
the Commission summarizes such information in a monthly "Official
Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing Office on a subscription basis.
During the fiscal year, the number of ownership reports filed with
the Commission reached an all-time high of 44,631 (6,573 initial statements of beneficial ownership on Form 3 and 38,058 statements of
changes in beneficial ownership on Form 4). This represents an increase of 2,924 over the 41,807 reports filed during the 1963 fiscal year.
Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits by Issuer

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by reason of their relationship with a
company, Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, Section 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and Section 30 (f) of the
Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of

60

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the issuer of any profit realized by insiders from certain purchases
and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than 6 months. The Commission has certain exemptive powers with respect to transactions not comprehended within
the purpose of these provisions, but is not charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies created thereby.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, Section 12(e)
of the Public Utility Holding Company A.ct of 1935, and Section 20 (a)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Commission has adopted
Regulation 14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent information in connection with the solicitation of proxies by companies subject to those statutes in order that shareholders will be able
to make decisions intelligently in regard to corporate affairs. The
regulation provides, among other things, that when the management
is soliciting proxies, any security holder desiring to communicate with
other security holders for a proper purpose may require the management to furnish him with a list of all security holders or to mail his
communication to security holders for him. A security holder may
also, subject to reasonable prescribed limitations, require the management to include in its proxy material any appropriate proposal which
such security holder desires to submit to a vote of security holders.
Any security holder or group of security holders may at any time
make an independent proxy solicitation upon compliance with the
proxy rules, whether or not the management is making a solicitation.
Certain additional provisions of the regulation are applicable where
a contest for control of the management of an issuer is involved.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to correct such
defects prior to the distribution of the proxy material to stockholders.
The Securities A.cts Amendments of 1964 extend the proxy solicitation requirements to those companies required to be registered under
Section 12(g) of the Act, and grant authority to the Commission to
promulgate rules and regulations requiring an issuer to send information to security holders even though a proxy solicitation is not
made, and requiring broker-dealers to transmit proxy material to
customers.

Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1964 fiscal year, 2,530 proxy statements in definitive
form were filed under the Commission's Regulation 14 for the solicitation of proxies of security holders; 2,513 of these were filed by management and 17 by nonmanagement groups or individual stockholders.
These 2,530 solicitations related to 2,310 companies, some 220 of which
had more than one solicitation during the year, generally for a special
meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 2,274 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
248 for special meetings not involving the election of directors, and
8 for assents and authorizations for action not involving a meeting of
security holders or the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, the decisions of security
holders were sought through the solicitation in the 1964 fiscal yea!"
of their proxies, consents and authorizations with respect to the following types of matters :

Proposals

During the 1964 fiscal year, a total of 211 proposals submitted by
45 stockholders were included in the proxy statements of 125 companies, pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters
or by-laws to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, limitations on granting stock options and their exercise by key
employees and management groups, sending a post-meeting report
to all stockholders, changing the place of the annual meeting of stockholders, and the approval by stockholders of management's selection
of independent auditors.
A total of 58 additional proposals submitted by 40 stockholders

Companies

Of the 2,467 issuers that had securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges as of June 30, 1964, 2,343 had voting securities so listed and registered. Of the latter group, 1,987, or 85
percent, solicited proxies under the Commission's proxy rules during
the Ulf}4fiscal year for the election of directors.
Proxy Contests

During the 1964 fiscal year, 18 companies were involved in proxy
contests for the election of directors. A total of 225 persons, both
management and nonmanagement, filed detailed statements as participants under the requirements of Rule 14a-l1. Proxy statements in
12 cases involved contests for control of the board of directors and
those in 6 cases involved contests for representation on the board.
Management retained control in 7 of the 12 contests for control
of the board of directors and lost control in 1 contest, and 4 contests
were still pending as of June 30,1964. Of the 6 instances where representation on the board of directors was involved, management retained all seats in 5 instances, and in the remaining case the opposition
won 1 place on the board.

REGULATION OF BROKER-DEALERS AND OVER.THE-COUNTER
MARKETS
Registration

Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
registration of all brokers and dealers who use the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect or induce transactions in
securities in the over-the-counter market. Brokers and dealers conducting an exclusively intrastate business or dealing only in exempted
securities, commercial paper, commercial bills or bankers' acceptances
are exempt from registration. The 1964Amendments added a Section
15(a) (2) which permits the Commission to exempt broker-dealers or
classes of broker-dealers, either unconditionally or upon specified terms
or conditions, from the requirement of registration.
The following tabulation reflects certain data with respect to registrations of brokers and dealers during the fiscal year ended June 30,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Administrative Proceedings

Sections 15(b) and 15lA) of the Exchange Act were amended in
several significant respects by the Securities Acts Amendments of
1964. 'Whereas under prior law the Commission could not proceed
directly against an individual associated with a broker-dealer firm,
but could take disciplinary action solely by proceeding against the
firm, the Act, as amended, permits such direct action. The Commission may censure an associated person, may suspend or bar him from
being associated with a broker or dealer, and may suspend or bar
him from being associated with a member of a registered securities
association. The sanctions which may be imposed against a brokerdealer now include censure and suspension of registration (for up to
12 months), in addition to the previously available sanctions of denial
or revocation of registration and expulsion or suspension from a registered securities association or national securities exchange.
A sanction may be imposed upon a broker-dealer under Section
15(b) if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission
finds that such sanction is in the public interest and that the brokerdealer, or any person associated with such broker-dealer, is subject to
one or more of the specified statutory disqualifications. A direct
sanction against an associated person may be imposed where the
Commission finds that it is in the public interest and that such person
has committed or omitted any act or omission which would be a basis
for the imposition of a sanction if such person were a broker-dealer.
The statutory disqualifications, which have been enlarged by the 1964
Amendments, include the following:
(1) wilfully false or misleading statements in an application for
registration or other report required to be filed under the Exchange
Act;
(2) conviction within the previous 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor which involved the purchase or sale of securities; arose out
of the conduct of business as a broker-dealer or investment adviser;
involved embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation
of funds or securities; or involved violation of the provisions of the
United States Code dealing with various frauds and swindles committed by use of the mails, telephone, telegraph, radio or television;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction against engaging in certain practices related to the securities business;
(4) wilful violation of any provision of the Securities Act of
1933, the Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the

THIRTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

65

Investment Company Act of 1940 or any of the Commission's rules
or regulations thereunder;
(5) wilfully aiding or abetting another person in a violation of
the Federal securities laws or rules and regulations thereunder or
failing reasonably to supervise other persons who commit such
violations; and
(6) employing a person barred or suspended from being associated with a broker-dealer.
Section 15A of the Exchange Act as amended empowers the Commission to suspend or expel a broker-dealer from membership in a
registered securities association or to suspend or bar any person from
being associated with a member, upon a finding of violation of the
Federal securities laws or any rule or regulation thereunder. The
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"') is the
only such association. Section 19(a) (3) of the Act gives the Commission power to take similar action against members of national
securities exchanges.

Decisions of Particular Interest

It is not feasible to summarize in this Report each of the many
decisions rendered by the Commission in administrative proceedings
with respect to brokers and dealers. However, several cases of unusual interest or significance, including some which involved procedural questions, are set forth in some detail in the following paragraphs:
On the basis of findings that they willfully violated the registration
and anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts, the Commission revoked the broker-dealer registrations of Gearhart &1 Otis, Inc. and
111cOoy ill Willard, expelled the former firm from membership in the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and found the principals of each firm causes of the action taken against their respective
firms," The Commission found that the respondents participated
in the distribution of a control block of stock of Air America, Inc.,
which was not registered, that both firms were underwriters, and that
• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7329 (June 2, 1964).

TF.URTIETHA~~~~AL REPORT

67

their sales were therefore not exempt from registration. The Commission further found that in the offer and sale of Air America equipment trust certificates through Gearhart & Otis as underwriter, an
.offering circular was used which was misleading in that, among other
things, it failed to disclose the company's precarious financial condition. In holding that Gearhart & Otis and ita principals willfully
violated the anti-fraud provisions in this connection, the Commission
noted that Gearhart was intimately familiar with all significant developments relating to Air America, that Otis was familiar with cer.tain facts not properly disclosed in the offering circular, and that in
.any event the firm, as underwriter, and its principals owed a duty to
.the investing public to exercise reasonable care to assure the substantial
accuracy of the offering circular. W'illiam D. McCoy, who was pres i.dent of Air America as well as a partner of McCoy & 'Willard, and who
played a leading role in the preparation of the offering circular, was
also held to have wilfully violated the anti-fraud provisions.
Among additional violations found with respect to Gearhart & Otis
and its principals was a willful violation by Gearhart of Section 7 of
the Securities Act (which specifies the information to be included in
a Securities Act registration statement) in causing National Lithium
<Corporation to file a misleading and inadequate registration statement.
The Commission noted that Gearhart, who signed the registration
statement as a director and as attorney-in-fact for other directors, was
primarily responsible for the terms of the cor-tract leading to the
creation of the company and was more familiar than anyone else with
the facts relating to its promotion and preliminary financing. It held
that as a director, and within the areas of his special knowledge, he
was accountable for the deficiencies in the registration statement; and
that as to those areas in which he did not have special knowledge, and
'where statements by an expert were not involved, he had a duty to make
a reasonable investigation regarding the accuracy and adequacy of the
information contained in the registration statement.
In J. A. Winston & 00., Ino.; the Commission revoked the registration of the Winston firm and found its principal officials causes of the
revocation, on the basis of findings that the respondents wilfully violated the anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts. The Commission
found that in the sale of stock of Gob Shops of America, Inc., respondents engaged in high-pressure sales tactics including the making of
"Optimistic and flamboyant statements with respect to, among other
things, the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer, which
statements had no reasonable basis in fact. Respondents argued that
• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7337 (June 8.1964).

68

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

any misrepresentations were made in good faith in reasonable reliance
on information supplied to them by the issuer's officials. The Commission noted, however, that respondents did not see or request any
current financial statements, and that the information assertedly given
to them was of a general and unsubstantiated nature and did not provide a reasonable basis for the representations made by respondents.
The Commission further found that respondents violated the antifraud provisions by selling securities at prices not reasonably related
to prevailing market prices. It reaffirmed that in the absence of
countervailing evidence, a dealer's own contemporaneous cost is the
best evidence of current market price, and noted the fact that the registrant purchased securities from other dealers at prices around such
other dealers' bid in the "sheets," thus demonstrating that the high
asked quotations were not, as claimed, reliable evidence of prevailing
market prices.
In R. J. Hayes &: Oompany, Inoorporated.: the Commission denied
the application for registration of a broker-dealer, whose president,
Ralph J. Hayes, had wilfully violated the anti-fraud and registration
provisions of the securities acts while employed as a salesman by
another broker-dealer. His employer was the underwriter of a "hot
issue" and Hayes, contrary to his employer's instructions not to purchase shares for his own account, opened fictitious accounts with the
employer and with other firms and purchased and resold at a profit,
shares of the "hot issue." The Commission found that his conduct
constituted a fraud on his employer and the other firms.
In 1962, the Commission had issued an order suspending Amos
Treat &: Co., Ino., from membership in the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., for 12 months, pursuant to an offer of settlement. During the 1964 fiscal year, the Commission issued its findings
and opinion in the case." It found that in the sale of securities of
three different issuers, the firm's salesmen made various misrepresentations. With respect to one offering, as to which the registrant
was managing underwriter, the Commission held that since the firm
and its officers had actual knowledge that the issuer's financial condition, as reflected in the registration statement, was deteriorating, they
should have exercised due diligence to ascertain current financial information, required its inclusion in the registration statement, and disclosed such information to the persons to whom they recommended
the stock and made optimistic representations. The Commission
again emphasized the responsibility of an underwriter to make a reasonable investigation into the issuer's business and the accuracy and

.adequacy of the information contained in the registration statement.
In A. T. Brad & Oompany,7 the Commission, pursuant to an offer
-of settlement submitted by the registrant and Albert T. Brad, a gen-eral partner, and a stipulation and consent submitted by Martin Lesser,
a former partner who was in charge of the firm's Washington, D.C.
office, found that the respondents wilfully violated the registration
and anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts in connection with the
offer and sale of unregistered shares of stock of Agricultural Research
Development, Inc. (AGR). Among other things, Lesser arranged
with a controlling person of AGR to place substantial amounts of
AGR stock in an account with registrant and to sell substantial
amounts to Lesser, for the purpose of distributing and trading in such
stock. During the distribution, registrant purchased shares and
placed quotations in the "sheets" at increasing prices and engaged in
a telephone campaign to sell AGR stock. Respondents were also
found to have wilfully violated the record-keeping and credit extension provisions under the Securities Exchange Act. In imposing a
40-day suspension from membership in the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., on registrant, as contemplated by the offer of
settlement, rather than a more severe sanction, the Commission consid-ered a number of mitigating factors cited by the firm and Brod.
Among other things, they asserted that Lesser initially acted with
respect to the AGR stock without Brod's knowledge, and disobeyed
subsequent instructions to discontinue transactions in such stock; that
registrant had discontinued its relationship with Lesser, closed the
Washington office,and arranged for restitution to customers who had
purchased AGR stock; and that steps giving reasonable assurance of
future compliance had been taken.
In Aircraft Dynamw8lnternational Oorp.,s the Commission found
that a broker-dealer firm, while acting as underwriter for a stock offering pursuant to Regulation A, committed various wilful violations of
the securities acts, and it revoked the firm's registration and expelled
it from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. In the course of the offering, the firm's salesmen made various
misrepresentations and employed other "boiler-room" techniques.
The Commission held, among other things, that the firm's president
and sole stockholder was responsible for the management of the business even if, as asserted, he did not take an active part in it. It further held that the sales manager was a participant in the violations,
-even if he himself did not offer or sell any of the stock, since by virtue
of his position he assumed responsibility for the supervision of the
'Securities Exchange Act Release No. 1139 (September 11.1963).
• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7113 (August 8. 1963).

70

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

salesmen, and the misrepresentations resulted from his failure to
exercise that responsibility.
In Fred L. Carvalho, doing business as Capital Investment Oompany,9 a salesman and public relations consultant for the registrant
prepared a brochure used in the sale of securities, which, among other
things, contained false and misleading projections of sales and earnings of the issuer and of the market price of the securities. The Commission rejected the salesman's defense that the financial data regarding the issuer had been supplied by the registrant, stating that "in the
light of his own unsuccessful attempts to obtain current information
directly from [the issuer] and his lack of knowledge of the company's
status and affairs, his employment of data deliberately chosen from
various sources to present a misleading and deceptive sales appeal
having no basis in fact was clearly fraudulent."
The Commission:
also rejected the salesman's claim that he was not acting in the capacity of an employee when performing public-relations functions and
that therefore no findings could be made against him. It noted that
he was actively involved in the mailing of the brochure, was paid a
weekly salary although he did not engage in sales during the period
in question, and had no other place of business, and concluded that he
was in fact an employee. The Commission revoked registrant's
broker-dealer registration and found the salesman a cause of the
revocation.
In Shiels Securities, lnc.r the registrant and certain associated
persons artificially inflated the price of securities by manipulative
practices. Among other things, the registrant's president and controlling stockholder, who was also president and controlling stockholder of the issuer, caused the latter to declare a dividend during
an offering of its securities through registrant as underwriter even
though it had inadequate earned surplus; and following the completion of the offering, the registrant, which was the only dealer actively
trading in the issuer's securities, purchased securities at prices which
it arbitrarily fixed at successively higher levels. In addition, registrant further wilfully violated the anti-fraud provisions of the
securities acts by selling the securities to customers at successfully
higher prices without disclosing that the price had been artificially
raised, and at excessive mark-ups, and by making materially false
and misleading statements in connection with the offer and sale of
the securities. The Commission concluded that it was in the public
interest to revoke registrant's registration.

ANNUAL

REPORT

Advanced Research Associates, Inc. was a consolidated proceeding consisting of stop order and Regulation A suspension proceedings
under the Securities Act of 1933,'2 and broker-dealer proceedings
with respect to four broker-dealers. Two of these, The First 'V ashington Corporation and 'Villiams, 'Vidmayer Incorporated, had been
organized by Don F. Widmayer and Richard N. Williams. The
Commission found that First 'Vashington, Widmayer and Williams,
among others, wilfully violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act in the sale of a large quantity of securities issued by Polytronic Research, Incorporated.
Certain claimed exemptions, including those provided by Regulation A, the so-called "private offering"
exemption, and the exemption provided by Rule 133 under the Securities Act, were held not to be available. The Commission further
found that First Washington, aided and abetted by Widmayer and
Williams, manipulated the market in Polytronic stock, by engaging
in activities which inflated and maintained the market price of the
stock at artificially high levels, failed to disclose such facts to purchasers and bid for and purchased Polytronic stock while engaged
in a distribution of such stock; and that "Widmayer and Williams were
responsible for fraudulent statements in brochures regarding Polytronic which were distributed to First Washington's customers and
for fraudulent representations by salesmen of that firm, and caused
Advanced Research to file a false and misleading registration statement. The Commission revoked the registrations OT the two firms
and found Widmayer and Williams each a cause of such action.
The Commission addressed itself to the problem of unwarranted
delay in the disposition of administrative proceedings in Herbert
!lapp, doing business as Webster Securities OompanyY In that case,
where it was alleged that registrant had failed to file required financial
reports and was subject to two injunctions, when the hearing examiner
arrived in New York City from W"ashington to convene the hearings
as scheduled, counsel for the registrant advised him that he had just
been retained solely to request an adjournment, but that he expected
to represent registrant. The examiner granted a 10-day adjournment. Ten days later he again traveled to New York to reopen the
hearings. At the reconvened hearings, both registrant and his counsel were present, but counsel requested a further adjournment, stating
that registrant, because he had been ill with "flu", had been unable to
reach counsel until that day. The hearing examiner granted a 2hour adjournment, and denied requests for a further adjournment.

The Commission upheld his denial and his refusal to reopen the hearings for the presentation of evidence in defense and mitigation.
Noting its continuing concern with the problem of delay in the disposition
'Of administrative proceedings, the Commission stated that "Repeated
adjournments granted pursuant to belated requests by neglectful
parties not only cause undue interference with the hearing examiner's
responsibilities and frustrate our efforts to avoid excessive delays, but
unfairly deprive parties in other proceedings of an expeditious
hearing."
In J. H. Goddard & 00., Ino.,14 the Commission denied a motion
to dismiss the proceedings and to dismiss allegations of violations of
Rule lOb--6 under the Exchange Act. With respect to the motion to
dismiss the proceedings, the Commission rejected the claim that the
institution of public rather than private proceedings denied movants
due process. It stated that under the Exchange Act, the determination whether a proceeding shall be public or private rests in the discretion of the Commission, and it noted that in these proceedings there
was a substantial public interest in the subject matter of the hearings;
that certain allegations were already a matter of public record; and
that public proceedings not only apprise investors of possible causes
of action against broker-dealers prior to the running of the statute of
limitations, but also enable them to institute such actions promptly
before witnesses become unavailable. With respect to the second part
of the motion, the Commission rejected the claims that Rule lOb--6
was so vague as to be violative of the due process clause, and that interpretation or revision of the rule in these proceedings would contravene the Administrative Procedure Act.
The principal question presented in Siltronics, Ino:" was the admissibility in evidence against certain broker-dealer respondents of
the record of prior consolidated proceedings to which they were parties
and which had been terminated as to them without prejudice to the
institution of new proceedings. In the prior proceedings, these respondents had claimed that under Am08 Treat d!J 00. v, S.E.O.16 termination was required because of participation in the proceedings by
a Commissioner who had served as director of an operating division
-during its investigation of a stock offering by Siltronics, Inc. Although respectfully disagreeing with that decision, the Commission
had terminated the proceedings. Thereafter, without the participation of the Commissioner in question, the Commission had instituted

solidated them with the prior proceedings against those respondents
who had not requested termination.
The Commission held the prior record admissible, rejecting the contentions that, under the Treat case, a special "taint" attached to that
record and that certain evidentiary requirements were not met. The
Commission noted that no action by it had affected the evidentiary
record. As to the second argument, the Commission pointed out that
the rules of evidence in jury trials have no strict application to administrati ve proceedings; that there had been full opportunity for crossexamination as to those charges made in both proceedings, and that as
to new charges, the staff's proposal to recall necessary witnesses at
Government expense would fulfill the requirement for such opportunity; and that it was not a material objection to admissibility of the
prior record that the witnesses might be available.
The Commission also denied motions by certain of the respondents
to dismiss or to sever the new proceedings, based on the assertion that
improper ex parte communications may have taken place between the
Commission and the staff in connection with the termination of the
prior proceedings and institution of the new proceedings, with respect
to the inclusion of additional charges, the consolidation of the new
proceedings with the unterminated proceedings and the offer in evidence of the record of the prior proceedings. The Commission pointed
out that following termination, when it considered the institution of
new proceedings and consolidation, it was no longer acting in an adjudicatory capacity with respect to the respondents as to whom the
proceedings had been terminated, and the separation-of-functions
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act were therefore not
applicable.
Suspension of Registration

Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to suspend a broker-dealer's registration pending final determination as to whether registration should be revoked. In order to
suspend registration, the Commission must find, after notice and
opportunity for hearing, that suspension is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The registrations of two broker-dealers were suspended during the past fiscal year
on the basis of such findings," The entry of a suspension order is of
course not determinative of the ultimate issue whether registration
should be revoked.

Net Capital Rule

The basic purpose of Rule 15c3-l, promulgated by the Commission
under Section 15 (c) (3) of the Exchange Act, is to safeguard funds
and securities of customers dealing with registered broker-dealers.
This rule, commonly known as the net capital rule, limits the amount
of indebtedness which may be incurred by a broker-dealer in relation
to its capital. It provides that the "aggregate indebtedness" of a
broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times the amount of its "net capital"
.as computed under the rule.
If it appears from an examination of the reports filed by a registered
broker-dealer with the Commission, or through inspection of its books
and records, that the ratio is exceeded, the Commission normally
notifies the broker-dealer of the deficiency and affords an opportunity
for compliance. Unless the capital situation is promptly remedied,
injunctive action may be taken by the Commission and in addition
proceedings may be instituted to revoke the broker-dealer's registration. During the past fiscal year, violations of the net capital rule
were charged in 19 injunctive actions and in 24 revocation proceedings
instituted against broker-dealers.
Registered broker-dealers who participate in "firm commitment"
underwritings must have sufficient capital to permit the participation
provided by the underwriting contract without impairing the capitaldebt ratio prescribed by the rule. For the protection of issuers and
customers of the broker-dealer, the Commission's staff carefully analyzes the latest available information on the capital position of the participants to determine whether they will be in compliance with the rule
upon assumption of the new obligations involved in the underwritings.
Acceleration of the effective date of registration statements filed under
the Securities Act will be denied where underwriting commitments
may engender violations of the net capital rule by any participating
underwriter. A participant found to be inadequately capitalized to
take down his commitment is notified and given an opportunity to adjust his financial position to meet the requirements of the rule without
reducing his commitments. If he is unable to meet such requirements,
he must decrease his "firm commitment" until compliance with the rule
is reached. If necessary he may have to withdraw from the underwriting or participate on a "best efforts" basis only.
As a result of recommendations of the Special Study of Securities
Markets, the Commission is presently in the process of formulating
a proposed rule which would establish minimum net capital requirements for broker-dealers.

Financial Statements

Rule 17a-5 under Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of financial condition with
the Commission. Such reports must be certified by a certified public
accountant or public accountant who is in fact independent, with
certain specified limited exemptions applicable to situations where
certification does not appear necessary for customer protection. Under certain circumstances member firms of national securities exchanges
are exempt from the necessity of certification and an exemption is
available for a broker-dealer who, since his previous report, has limited
his securities business to soliciting subscriptions as an agent for issuers,
has transmitted funds and securities promptly, and has not otherwise
held funds or securities for or owed monies or securities to customers.
Also exempt is a broker or dealer who, from the date of his last report,
has confined his business to buying and selling evidences of indebtedness secured by liens on real estate and has carried no margin accounts,
credit balances or securities for any customers.
After his registration, a broker-dealer's first financial report must
reflect his condition as of a date between the end of the 1st and 5th
months after the effective date of the registration. All reports must
be filed within 45 days after the date as of which the report speaks.
Through these reports the Commission and the public may evaluate
the financial position and responsibility of broker-dealers. The financial report is one means by which the staff of the Commission determines whether the registrant is in compliance with the net capital rule.
Failure to file the required reports may result in the institution of
revocation proceedings. However, it is the policy of the Commission
first to advise the broker-dealer of his obligations under the rule and
to give him an opportunity to file the report.
During the fiscal year 4,503 reports of financial condition were filed
with the Commission compared to the 1963 total of 5,197.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act provides for regular and periodic
.inspections of registered broker-dealers. During the fiscal year the
number of such inspections totaled 1,422. The inspection device is a
most useful instrument in protecting investors and detecting violations of the Federal securities laws. The inspection, among other
things, determines a broker-dealer's financial condition, reviews his
pricing practices, evaluates the safeguards employed in handling
customers' funds and securities, and determines whether adequate and
.:accurate disclosures are made to customers.

76

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The Commission's inspectors also determine whether brokers and
dealers are keeping books and records as required by the Exchange
Act and the Commission's rules thereunder and are conforming to the
margin and other requirements of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve
Board. Inspectors also look for excessive trading or switching in
customers' accounts. Inspectors frequently find evidence of the sale
of unregistered securities or of fraudulent practices such as use of
improper sales literature or sales techniques,
When inspections reveal that a broker-dealer is violating the statutes
or rules, the action taken depends on the type of violation and its effect
on the public. The Commission does not take formal action as a
result of every infraction discovered. Inspections frequently reveal
inadvertent violations which are discovered before becoming serious
and before customers' funds or securities are in danger. 'When no
harm has come to the investing public the registrant is generally
informed of the violations and advised to correct the improper practices. If the violation appears to be wilful and the public interest is
best served by formal action against the broker-dealer, the Commission will institute appropriate proceedings.

inspection program during the fiscal year:

The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the principal stock exchanges also conduct inspections of their members, and
some states have inspection programs. Each inspecting agency conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Inspections
by the Commission are primarily concerned with the detection of violations of the Federal securities laws and the Commission's regulations.
The inspection programs of the self-regulatory agencies and of the
states afford added protection to the public. The Commission and
certain other inspecting agencies coordinate their inspections to avoid
duplication and to obtain the widest possible coverage of brokers and
dealers. Agencies now participating in this coordination program

include the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange,
the Boston Stock Exchange, the Mid west Stock Exchange, the Pacific
Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadel phia- Baltimore- Washington Stock
Exchange, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. It is hoped that even closer coordination may become possible in the future as recommended by the Special
Study of Securities Markets. This coordination, however, does not
preclude the Commission from inspecting any broker-dealer that has
also been inspected by another agency, and such inspections are made
whenever reason therefor exists.
SUPERVISION OF ACfMTIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of IV34 provides for the
registration with the Commission of national securities associations
and establishes standards for such associations.
The National Asso.ciation of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association
registered under the Act.
The Act contemplates that such associations will serve as a medium
for the cooperative self-regulation of over-the-counter brokers and
-denlers, Their rules must be designed to protect investors nnd the
public interest, to promote just and equitable principles of trade and
to meet other statutory requirements.
They are to opernte under the
general supervision of the Commission which is authorized to review
disciplinary actions taken by them and other decisions which affect
the membership of members, or of applicants for membership, and to
consider all changes in their rules. The Securities Acts Amendments
-of 1V64 significantly changed several statutory provisions regarding
registered securities associations. Such associations are now required
to adopt appropriate standards regarding the training, experience
and other qualifications of members and persons associated with members; to have rules designed to produce fair and informative quotations
of over-the-counter securities; and may bring disciplinary action
directly against individuals associated with members.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of such associations, Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude n member from dealing with a nonmember, except on the same terms and con-ditions as the member affords the investing public. The N ASD has
adopted such rules. Accordingly, membership is necessary to the
profitable participation in underwritings and over-the-counter trading
since members may properly grant price concessions, discounts and
'similar allowances only to other members. Loss or denial of member-

ship due to expulsion or suspension or other ineligibility due to a
statutory disqualification, or to failure to meet standards of qualification established in NASD rules, thus imposes a severe economic
sanction.
At the close of i l.e fiscal year NASD membership was 4,158, reflecting a net decrease of 506 members during the year. This decrease was
the result of 270 admissions to and 776 terminations of membership.
During the year the registered representative population, which generally includes all partners, officers, traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated with member firms in capacities which
involve their doing business directly with the public, declined by
9,540 to stand at 77,835 at June 30, 1964. This shrinkage was the
result of 8,175 initial registrations, 10,966 reregistrations and 28,681
terminations of registrations during the year.
In addition to its review of NASD rules and disciplinary actions,
the Commission established during the year a program for periodic
inspections of the Association's national and district offices. In fiscal
1964, the Commission staff conducted its first two district inspections
which covered a broad range of subjects including surveillance and
enforcement of association rules of conduct, the dissemination of quotations for local newspaper publication, and the organization of
district business conduct committees.
NASD Disciplinary Actions

The Commission receives from the NASD copies of its decisions in
all disciplinary actions against members and registered representatives. In general, such actions are based on findings that the respondents violated specified provisions of the NASD's Rules of Fair
Practice. 'Where violations are found the NASD may impose one or
more sanctions upon a member, including expulsion, suspension, fine
or censure. If an individual who is not a member is involved, his registration as a representative may be suspended or revoked, he may be
suspended or barred from being associated with all members, and he
may be fined or censured. Under Section 15A(b) (4) of the Exchange
Act and the NASD's by-laws, no broker-dealer may be admitted to or
continued in NASD membership without Commission approval, if he
has been suspended or expelled from NASD membership; has been
found to be a cause of certain sanctions imposed on a member; is subject to certain sanctions imposed by the Commission or a national securities exchange; or permits a person to associate with him who is
subject to one of the above disqualifications, whose registration is suspended or has been revoked, or who is suspended or has been barred
from associating with member firms.

TEURTIETH ~AL

REPORT

During the past fiscal year the NASD reported to the Commission
its final disposition in disciplinary complaint actions against 405
member firms and 372 registered representatives. With respect to 73
members, complaints were dismissed on findings that allegations of
violations had not been sustained."
In the remaining cases violations
were found and some penalties were imposed on 332 members and 342
registered representatives or other individuals.
The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was imposed
on 73 different members and 16 members were suspended from membership for periods ranging from 15 days to 2 years. In many of these
expulsion or suspension cases, substantial fines were also imposed. In
194 cases the principal penalties imposed were fines ranging from
$25 to $10,000. In 48 other cases the only sanction imposed was censure, although censure was often a secondary penalty imposed where
a fine was the principal penalty imposed.
Various penalties were also imposed on registered representatives
found in violation of the NASD's rules. The registrations of 132
representatives were revoked and 43 had their registrations suspended
for periods ranging from 15 days to 2 years. In addition, 13 other
individuals whose registrations were not revoked were found to have
been the causes of the expulsion of 13 member firms and in one instance
the cause of a I-year suspension of a member. Allegations of violations against 30 representatives were dismissed on findings that no
violation had occurred.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action

Section 15A(g) of the Act, as amended, provides that disciplinary
actions by the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its
own motion or on the timely application of any aggrieved person.
This Section also provides that the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD is automatically stayed pending Commission
review, unless the Commission otherwise orders after notice and opportunity for hearing. Section 15A(h) of the Act defines the scope
of the Commission's review. If the Commission finds that the disciplined party engaged in or omitted such acts or practices as were
found by the NASD, that such acts, practices, or omissions to act are
in violation of such rules of the association as have been designated in

and equitable principles of trade, the Commission must dismiss the
review proceedings unless it finds that the penalties imposed are excessive or oppressive, having due regard to the public interest, in which
case it must cancel or reduce such penalties. At the beginning of the
fiscal year, 23 review proceedings were pending before the Commission; during the year 17 additional petitions for review were filed,
decisions were issued in 18 cases, three petitions were withdrawn prior
to determination, and 1D petitions were pending at the year end.
In its review of association disciplinary actions, the Commission
issued several significant decisions during the year involving applications of the NASD mark-Up policy.
In an important decision reviewing and reappraising the standards
for determining the fairness under the NASD's mark-up policy of
prices charged by broker-dealers, the Commission sustained the
NASD's findings that Naftalin ill 00., Inc. charged unfair prices in
its sale of stock to customers and thus violated the NASD's Rules of
Fail' Practice." While sustaining the NASD findings of violations,
the Commission reduced the penalty imposed against the firm from
expulsion to a 20-day suspension from NASD membership, and the
penalty against George E. Clark, a registered representative, from
revocation of registration to a 20-day suspension. The Commission
affirmed the N ASD's censure of the firm and Clark and fines of $4,500
and $1,000, respectively, and found Neil T. Naftalin, president of the
firm, a enuse of the fiI'm's suspension.
The NASD had found that the Naftalin firm as principal made 85
sales of Dnrox of Minnesota, Inc., stock to customers at prices ranging
from 2% to 3%, and that such prices represented mark-ups of up to
28.5 percent over same-day costs and an average mark-up over cost on
all sales of 17.9 percent. Such prices were found by the NASD to be
in contravention of its Rules of Fair Practice which state that a
member "shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just
and equitable principles of trade" and require that where a member
sells a security for his own account to his customer the price must be
fair, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, including
market conditions, the expense involved, and the fact that the member
is entitled to a profit.
Respondents contended that there were no violations because the
firm's retail prices were identical with telephone quotations obtained
prior to each sale from another dealer who was making a market in
the stock. The Commission found, however, that the other dealer's
telephone quotations were regularly subject to negotiation and there.

fore not reliable as a test of prevailing market price and that the firm's
actual, contemporaneous costs were representative, and the best evidence, of the actual market in the Durox stock. The Commission
stated:
We note that the NASD mark-up policy expressly states that "[i]n the
absence of other bona fide evidence of the prevailing market, a member's own
contemporaneous cost is the best indication of the prevailing market price."
The use of contemporaneous cost as an appropriate base upon which to compute
mark-ups in retail transactions, "absent countervailing evidence," has frequently
been recognized in our decisions and has been affirmed by the courts. This rule
merely reflects a recognition of the fact that the prices paid for a security by a
dealer in actual transactions closely related in time to his sales are normally
a highly reliable indication of the prevailing market price. And the rule applies
Whether or not a dealer has a position in the security, unless it can be shown that
the dealer's contemporaneous cost is not representative of the market price prevailing at the time of his sales. [Footnotes omitted]

The respondents urged various considerations in mitigation of the
penalties assessed against them. They asserted, among other things,
that they acted in good faith, that any violations of the NASD rules
were unintentional and due to lack of experience, the violations having
occurred in the first few months of the firm's existence, aad that'the
deficiencies were promptly corrected when called to their attention and
did not recur. Respondents further urged that while some sanction
may have been warranted, the firm was now a thoroughly responsible,
professional and reputable concern, with qualified and trained personnel, which was worthy of continuing in the securities business, and that
the public interest did not require or warrant expulsion, but at most
a short suspension. Because of the mitigating circumstances, including the extensive efforts of the firm to remedy its initial shortcomings
and to develop a qualified organization, equipped with adequate facilities and staffed by well-trained or experienced personnel, the Commission concluded that reduced sanctions were appropriate in the
public interest.
In another case involving findings by the NASD of excessive markups, the Commission sustained the NASD's action expelling General
In'IJesting Oorporation. from membership and revoking the registration
of Ralph De Pasquale, its president, as a registered representative."
The NASD found that the firm charged mark-ups ranging between
12.5 percent and 37.5 percent in 83 principal sales transactions. In 43
transactions the mark-ups were computed by the NASD on the basis
of the firm's same-day cost, and in the remaining transactions on the
basis of representative asked quotations in the National Quotation

Bureau's daily sheets. The Commission rejected applicants' contention that with respect to 73 transactions involving 5 security issues
the NASD should have computed mark-ups on the basis of the firm's
own inside offer because the firm was the primary market maker,
maintained a large inventory, and dominated the market in these
securities, and the quotations of other dealers appearing in the sheets
were unrealistic because these dealers were primarily interested in
selling to the firm at its higher bid price.
While noting the problems pointed out by the Special Study of
Securities Markets as to the proper base for calculating mark-ups
with respect to retail sales by a sole or dominant market-maker, the
Commission observed that if, as applicants contended, the firm was
the primary market maker and dominated the market, to allow the
firm to compute mark-ups on the basis of its own inside offer "when
other firms are offering at wholesale prices lower than the firm's inside
offer would make a sham of the protection intended by the NASD
proscription that a member shall not charge unfair prices in principal
transactions with customers." The Commission also noted that the
evidence did not appear to support applicants' contention that other
dealers were primarily selling to the firm and that, in any event, applicants had not contended that the quotations of other dealers were not
bona fide prices at which they were willing to trade with other brokers
and dealers. Applicants' contentions that their mark-ups were justified in view of the risk assumed in maintaining an inventory and the
expenses incurred in selling these securties through extensive solicitation efforts were rejected by the Commission, which stated that "such
factors do not justify retail prices higher than those at which the
same securities are generally available to investors through other dealers who operate in the same market."
In J. A. Winston &: Oo., lno.,21 another mark-Up case, the NASD
found that the firm effected 131 retail sales of Atlas Credit Corporation
Class A stock and 563 retail sales of Atlas Class B stock at mark-ups
over its same-day cost of purchases from other dealers which averaged
26.5 percent and 33.5 percent for each class, respectively.
Respondents contended, among other things, that mark-ups in the
Class B stock should have been computed on the basis of the firm's
cost of purchases from retail customers, representing the large majority of its purchases, rather than on the lower cost of purchases from
other dealers, and, as to the Class A stock, that they properly effected
their retail sales at a price equal to or below the high independent
asked price quoted in the "sheets." The Commission noted that the

Winston firm throughout the period in question had virtually complete
control over purchase and sale prices, as well as supply and demand,
of the Class B stock; that it was buying from other dealers at its own
bid prices which it maintained below its retail purchase prices; and
that, although it had a short position during most of the period, it was
in a position to cover that position merely by adjusting its bid or by
shifting the emphasis on retail solicitation from the sale to the purchase side. Under these circumstances, the Commission concluded
that "there is little value in basing a determination of unfair pricing
on a comparison or percentage relationship between resale prices and
cost or any other single factor; it is more meaningful clearly to examine
the prices actually charged in light of the surrounding circumstances
and to determine whether those prices were fair." On the basis of the
relevant factors, including the fact that "market" in the context of a
pricing problem generally refers to the inter-dealer market, and the
arbitrary pricing of the Class B stock above the independent market
for the Class A stock, the Commission sustained the NASD's conclusion that the prices charged were excessive.
'Vith respect to the Class A stock the Commission noted that "the
great preponderance of numerical quotations on the offered side and
the firm's ability consistently to make purchases . . . from other
dealers at prices below the quoted asked prices, make it clear that the
quotations were regularly subject to negotiation and therefore not
reliable as a test of the prevailing market price." It concluded that
under the circumstances the firm's same-day cost in purchases from
dealers was the best evidence of the inter-dealer market. In response
to respondents' contention that the spread between their purchase
and sale prices was not inconsistent with NASD-sponsored retail
quotations on other securities published in newspapers, the Commission stated that "the difference, alone, between the bid and asked
quotations cannot properly be treated as a measure of what is a fair
or reasonable mark-up over contemporaneous cost."
The Commission also found that respondents wilfully failed to
register 141 salesmen and "contact men." It sustained the penalties
imposed by the NASD of expulsion of the firm from membership
and revocation of the registration of its principals.
In a proceeding involving mark-downs, the Commission sustained
action by the NASD imposing a fine of $500 against Thill Securitiee
Oorp. based on its findings that the firm purchased securities from
customers at unfair prices in violation of the NASD Rules of Fair
Practice."

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In its decision the Commission disagreed with the position of the
NASD that the best indication of the prevailing market price against
which to measure the prices paid customers was the price realized
by the firm in same-day resales to other dealers. Since the securities
were not low-priced or speculative in nature, and had a competitive
market and possessed a narrow spread between bids and offers, the
Commission found that contemporaneous bid quotations obtained
by the firm from dealers making the market were acceptable evidence
of the prevailing market price. Based on such concurrent bids, the
mark-downs ranged between 5 and 6 percent in eight transactions,
between 4 and 5 percent in five transactions, and between 2 and 4
percent in tour transactions. The Commission determined that it
was "not prepared to disagree" with the NASD's conclusions that "in
'Our experience industry practice does not warrant such mark-downs
in the circumstances presented, even with the rendition of extraordinary service to customers."
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership

As previously noted, Section 15A(b) of the Act and the by-laws
of the NASD provide that, except where the Commission finds it
appropriate in the public interest to approve or direct to the contrary,
no broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership
if he, or any person associated with him, is under any of the several
disabilities specified in the statute or the by-laws. A Commission
order approving or directing admission to or continuance in association membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under Section
15A (b) (4) of the Act, or under an effective association rule adopted
under that Section or Section 15A(b) (3), is generally entered only
after the matter has been submitted initially to the association by
the member or applicant for membership. The association in its
discretion may then file an application with the Commission on behalf
of the petitioner. A broker-dealer, however, may file an application
directly with the Commission either with or without association sponsorship. The Commission reviews the record and documents filed
in support of the application and, where appropriate, obtains additional relevant and pertinent evidence. During the year eight such
petitions were filed; five were approved; 28 one was disapproved as
discussed below; and two were pending at the end of the year.
The Commission disapproved a petition by the NASD that a member firm be continued in membership with Edgar R. D'Abre in its
employ." The transactions giving rise to D'Abre's disqualification

occurred in 1959, when D' Abre opened two accounts in a fictitious
name and allocated shares of "hot issues" to those accounts, realizing
profits of $6,000 therefrom over a period of several months. When
questioned by his then employer, he fabricated a credit report on the
nonexistent customer but his explanation was unacceptable to the
firm and he was discharged in August 1959. Following a hearing,
at which D'Abre presented an elaborate explanation, an NASD District Business Conduct Committee concluded that the accounts were
in fact D'Abre's, characterized his explanation as "preposterous,"
found that D' Abre had effected transactions in those accounts without
the consent or knowledge of his employer, and revoked his registration
as a registered representative.
Shortly before the decision was issued, D'Abre had obtained employment as a salesman for another firm; and thereafter proceedings
were instituted before the NASD to determine whether the newemployer should be continued in membership with D'Abre as an employee. Subsequently, an NASD application for approval of such
continuance was remanded by the Commission 25 which expressed concern as to D'Abre's appreciation of "the professional obligation to his
employer and to the public that further participation in the securities
field entails." After further hearings and consideration by the
NASD, the latter renewed its application for approval.
In denying the second application the Commission stated, in part:
The violations of NASD rules committed by D'Abre were of a serious nature,
involving not only "free riding," but the manufacture over a period of several
months of fictitious accounts and records and a false credit report, for the purpose of deceiving his employer and concealing violations of the restrictions upon
transactions in new issues. This misconduct was compounded by D'Abre's concoction and presentation of false explanations to the NASD and his persistent
failure to disclose the true facts. Only the pressure created by our remand and
tbe ensuing beariDg...finallYcaused D'Abre to admit that the accounts were fictitious and to state that be regretted his violation of the trust that had been
reposed in him. It was only after some prompting that he admitted his profit

subsequent bearing, be probably would never bave acknowledged the facts. Tbat
he made no further denials of bis improprieties after the first District Committee decision or that he believed that the Committee members probably knew he
had lied to them, cannot excuse his continued lack of candor.

The Commission concluded that these circumstances clearly demonstrated D'Abre's "unreliability and his lack of understanding of his
obligation to his employer, to the District Committee, to the Board
of Governors of the NASD and to the securities industry."

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
In administering the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding-company
systems engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to natural gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which
are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Although the matters under the Act dealt with by the Commission and its staff embrace
a variety of intricate and complex questions of law and fact generally
involving more than one area of regulation, briefly there are three
principal regulatory areas. The first covers those provisions of the
Act, contained principally in Section 11(b) (1), which require the
physical integration of public-utility companies and functionally related properties of holding-company systems and those provisions,
contained principally in Section 11(b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of holding company systems. The second covers the financing operations of
registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the acquisition
and disposition of securities and properties, and certain accounting
practices, servicing arrangements and intercompany transactions.
The third includes the exemptive provisions of the Act, the provisions
covering the status under the Act of persons and companies, and those
regulating the right of a person affiliated with a public-utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such affiliation. Matters embraced within this last area of regulation come before the Commission and its staff frequently. Many such matters do not result in
formal proceedings and others are reflected in such proceedings only
in an indirect manner when they are related to issues principally under
one of the other areas of regulation.
The Branch of Public Utility Regulation of the Commission's
Division of Corporate Regulation performs the principal functions
under the Act. It observes and examines problems which arise in
connection with transactions which are or may be subject to regula86

tion under the Act and discusses such problems with interested persons
and companies and advises them as to the applicable sections of the
Act, the rules thereunder and Commission policy with respect thereto.
Questions are raised with and problems presented to the staff daily.
These include questions raised by security holders and problems presented by companies contemplating transactions which require the
filing of an application or declaration, particularly financing operations and the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties.
This day-to-day activity includes prefiling discussions and conferences,
in person and by telephone, with company representatives and with
other persons where the matter under consideration affects their interests. In those instances where formal proceedings are held, members
of the staff actively participate in hearings and often aid the Commission in the preparation of its decision on a particular matter. The
staff continually reexamines the status of exempt companies, examines
the annual reports filed with the Commission and those sent to stockholders and must keep abreast of new technical developments in the
electric and gas industry, including the use of atomic energy as a source
of power.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANY SYSTEMS

At the close of the fiscal year there were 24 holding companies registered under the Act. Of these, 18 are included in the 16 remaining
holding-company systems which are herein classified as "active registered holding-company systems," 2 of the 18 being subholding companies in these active systems.' The remaining 6 registered holding
companies are of relatively small size and are excluded from the active
holding-company systems," In the 16 active systems there are 84
electric and/or gas utility subsidiaries, 41 nonutility subsidiaries, and
12 inactive companies, or a total, including the 18 parent holding companies, of 155 system companies. The following table shows the number of holding companies and the number of subsidiaries (classified
as utility, nonutility, and inactive) in each of the active systems as
of June 30, 1964, and the aggregate assets of these systems, less valuation reserves, as of December 31, 1963.
1The two subholdlng companies are The Potomac Edison Co., a subsidiary of .Allegheny
Power System, Inc., and Southwestern Electric Power Co., a subsidiary of Central and
South West Corp.
• These holding companies are .American Gas Co.; British .American Utilities Corp.;
Colonial Utilities Corp. ; K1nzua 011 & Gas Corp. and Its subholdlng company, Northwestern
Pennsylvania Gas Corp. ; and Standard Gas & Electric Co.

SECTION 11 M4TTJ3RS IN ACTIVE REGISTERED HOLDING-COMPANY
SYSTEMS

On October 10,1963, a publ~chearing was held on Step 2 of a plan
filed, pursuant to Section l l ( e ) , by Eastern Utilities Associates
("EU-4") proposing the sale of all the outstanding common stock of
Valley Gas Co., to the shareholders of EUA, and to the public common
stockholders of Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Co. ('<Blackstone"), a subsidiary of EUA and the owner of all the outstanding
common shares of Valley Gas Co. On March 3,1964, the Commission
issued its Findings and Opinion and OrderS approving Step 2 and,
upon the request of EUA, an application for an order enforcing the
plan was filed with the U.S. D~strictCourt for the District of Rhode
Island. Following a hearing, a t which a public stockholder of Blackstone appeared in opposition to the plan, the court approved Step 2

ANNUAL REPORT

of the plan by order dated July 14, 1964.4 Upon its consummation, the
separation of the gas utility properties from the EUA system will
have been completed. Prior proceedings in this matter are discussed
at page 109 of the 27th Annual Report.
In its Order of February 20, 1958, pursuant to Section l1(b) (1),
permitting retention by New England Electric System of all its electric properties," the Commission reserved jurisdiction to determine
whether the system's gas properties were retainable under that Section
of the Act. After further proceedings the Commission, on March
19, 1964, issued its Findings and Opinion and Order directing New
England Electric System to divest itself of all its interests in its gas
properties,"
New England Electric System has filed a petition to review this order in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. At the
close of the fiscal year the case was pending before the court.
The Commission has held, with court approval, that the existence of
publicly-held minority interests in the common stock of subsidiary
companies of registered holding companies constitutes an inequitable
distribution of voting power requiring the elimination of such minority interests under Section 11(b) (2). Through appropriate proceedings under the Act the Commission has heretofore ordered the elimination of public minority interests in most of the registered
holding-company systems, but the problem remains in several others.
During fiscal 1964,Allegheny Power System, a registered holding company, filed a plan, pursuant to Section 11(e) of the Act, proposing the
elimination of a 4.8 percent public minority interest in the common
stock of its subsidiary company, West Penn Power Company, through
the exchange of 1.7 shares of Allegheny Power's then $5 par value common stock for each share of publicly-held West Penn common stock.
The proposed exchange would involve the issuance of Allegheny's new
common stock with an aggregate market value of approximately
$15,600,000 as of June 30, 1964.1 Public hearings on the plan were
held during fiscal 1964; following the close of the fiscal year, the Commission approved the plan,"
• In the Matter of Valley GaB00., et at (D.R.I., Civil Act No. 2685).
• See 38 S.E.C. 193.
• Holding Company Act Release No. 15035.
• Dnring the pendency of the plan each share of Allegheny's $5 par value common stock
was reclassified Into two shares of $2.50 par value common stock. Thus, the exchange
ratio became 3.4 shares of Allegheny stock for each share of West Penn stock. Holding

systems In which a minority interest problem exists, and as to which no proceedings have
been proposed by the systems or instituted by the Commission, are The Columbia Gas System, Inc., Eastern Utilities Associates. and New England Electric System. The minority
Interests of the last-named holding-company system are confined to several of the gas utility
SUbsidiaries, a question as to the retalnabll1ty of which, as noted above, Is pending before
the court of appeals.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A Section 11(b) (1) problem still exists as to whether Middle South
Utilities, Inc. may, through its subsidiary company, New Orleans
Public Service, Inc., retain its interest in the gas and transportation
properties of that subsidiary company together with the system's
electric properties. The electric properties of the Middle South system
have heretofore been found by the Commission to constitute a single
integrated public-utility system. On January 10, 1963, a bill was
introduced in the Congress (H.R. 742, 88th Cong., 1st Sess.) providing,
in effect, that New Orleans Public Service, Inc. shall not be required
to dispose of its gas or transportation properties pursuant to any
provision of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. At the
close of fiscal 1964, the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, to which the bill was referred, had taken no action thereon;
and no proceedings have been instituted by the Commission."
EXEMPT

HOLDING

COlUP ANIES

A "holding company" is defined by Section 2(a) (7) (A) of the Act
to mean any company which owns or controls 10 percent or more of
the outstanding voting securities of an electric or gas public-utility
company. Section 3 (a) of the Act provides that the Commission shall
exempt any holding company (and its subsidiary companies, as such)
from the duties and obligations of the Act if the company meets one
or more of the exemptive standards set forth in that Section, unless
the Commission finds that the exemption would be detrimental to the
public interest. Such exemption may be granted by the Commission
by order upon application, or (as to certain types of exemption) may
be claimed by the holding company by the filing in "good faith" of a
statement pursuant to Rule 2 promulgated by the Commission under
Section 3. At the close of the fiscal year statements submitted by a
total of 55 holding companies under Rule 2 were on file with the Commission. Every initial Rule 2 statement and each annual statement
renewing the claimed exemption is carefully examined by the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation to ensure that the claimant
is entitled to its asserted exempt status under Section 3(a). In addition, six applications for exemption orders under Section 3 (a) were
pending at the beginning of fisca11964, and five additional applications
were filed during the fiscal year. The Commission issued orders grant• No further action was taken during fiscal 1964 with respect to certain Section 11 (b)
problems of several other registered holding companies referred to at page 104 of the 27th
Annual Report.

ing exemptions to five of the applicants during fiscal 1964; 10 and
after the close of the year two additional exemption orders were
issued.v
Exempt holding companies are nevertheless subject to the provisions
of Section 9(a) (2) of the Act, which prohibits them from acquiring
as much as 5 percent of the voting stock of any other public-utility
company unless the acquisition has been approved by the Commission
under Section 10. During the fiscal year, Cincinnati Gas & Electric
Company (which claims exemption under Rule 2 as "predominantly a
public-utility company") applied for and was granted authority to
acquire the outstanding voting securities of two neighboring gas
utility companies.>

PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS OF FIRST, MORTGAGE BONDS AND
PREFERRED STOCKS OF PUBLICUTiLITY COMPANIES

Statements of policy were adopted by the Commission in 1956 codifying the standards to which provisions covering first mortgage bonds
and preferred stocks issued under the Act must conform for the protection of investors in such securities," Prior to 1956 these standards
had been established by the Commission on a case-by-case basis. In
passing upon the issuance of first mortgage bonds and preferred stocks
under the Act, the Commission examines the applicable mortgage
indentures and charter provisions to ensure a continuing substantial
conformity with the codified standards of the respective statements
of policy. Such conformity has been uniformly required except
where, in particular circumstances, deviations from the statements of
policy are clearly justified.
During the fiscal year, applications or declarations were filed by
public-utility companies subject to the Act with respect to 14 first
mortgage bond issues involving an aggregate principal amount of
$241,525,000, and 5 preferred stock issues with a total par value of
$34 million.
The statement of policy with respect to first mortgage bonds requires, among other things, that dividends or other distributions to
common stockholders be limited so as to preserve an "equity cushion"
beneath the claims of the bondholders. This requirement was adequately provided for in the indentures covering the 14 bond issues
as filed or as a result of informal discussions between the Commission's
staff and representatives of the issuers.
Since the bulk of bondholders' security consists of mortgaged depreciable plant and equipment, the statement of policy for bonds also
requires the periodic renewal and replacement of such property so as
to preserve the book value of the underlying security. This requirement, in substance, obligates the issuing company to provide for new
property additions (or, alternatively, to deposit cash or outstanding

bonds with the trustee) in an amount which, over the estimated useful
life of the mortgaged depreciable property, will maintain the original
book cost of the mortgaged property,
The statement of policy requires that the mortgage indenture express the periodic renewal and
replacement obligation as a' percentage of the book cost of the mortgaged depreciable property, but where existing indentures express the
provision on some other basis (usually, as a percentage of operating
revenues), such alternate. provision is permitted to remain unchanged
if the issuer can satisfactorily demonstrate to the Commission that
the existing provision affords substantially the same protection as that
based on a percent-of-property
basis. To ensure observance of
this standard of the statement of policy, the Commission's staff conducts a continuous study of the depreciation requirements of the various issuers subject to the Act.
Of the 14 bond issues with respect to which applications or declarations were filed during the fiscal year, the indentures of 13 expressed
the renewal and replacement provision as a percentage of depreciable
property deemed adequate by the Commission. The remaining issue
(bonds of a pipe line company) provided for a 100 percent amortization of the issue over its life through the operation of a cash sinking
fund, and accordingly no renewal and replacement provision was
deemed necessary for the protection of the bondholders.
With respect to the five preferred stock issues as to which applications or declarations were filed during the fiscal year, the existing
charter provisions of all but one were in substantial conformity with
the statement of policy for preferred stock; and as to the remaining
issue, conformance with the statement of policy was effected through
conditions imposed by order of the Commission."
In accordance with its long-standing policy under the Act, the Commission has continued to require that bonds and preferred stock sold
by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries be fully refundable at the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and that
any redemption premium be reasonable in amount. During fiscal year
1964, as previously noted, three issuers 19 subject to the Act took advantage of the refunding privilege and prevailing favorable market
conditions to refund outstanding bonds at lower interest rates; and
one issuer 20 refunded a preferred stock issue at a lower dividend rate.

gated $254,328; 21 and the annual dividend savings on the preferred
stock issue refunded were $30,160.22 Had the outstanding issues been
nonrefundable or severely restricted as to refundability, such savings
could not have been effectuated."
Continuing studies made by the Commission's staff for fiscal year
1964 with respect to electric and gas utility bond issues sold at competitive bidding, whether or not subject to the Act, indicated that the
presence or absence of a restriction on free refundability has not
affected the number of bids received by an issuer at competitive
bidding or the ability of the winning bidder to market the bonds. "The
29th Annual Report, at pp. 85-86, noted that the data for fiscal.year
1963 with respect to such ability on the part of the winning bidder
were at variance with the data for prior fiscal years. That same report, at the pages referred to, contains a summary of the results of an
examination of all electric and gas utility bond issues (including
debentures) sold at competitive bidding between May 14, 1957, and
June 30,1963, by companies subject to the Act as well as those not so
subject. This study was extended to include fiscal year 1964.
During the period from May 14, 1957 to June 30, 1964, a total of
466 electric and gas utility bond issues, aggregating $10,401.9 million
principal amount, was offered at competitive bidding. The refundable issues numbered 350 and accounted for a total of $6,601.5 million,
while the nonrefundable issues-all being nonrefundable for a period
of 5 years, except one which was nonrefundable for a period of 7
years-numbered 116 and totaled $3,800.4 million principal amount.
The number of refundable issues thus represented 75.1 percent of the
total number of issues, while, in terms of principal amount, the refundable issues accounted for 63.5 percent.>
The weighted average number of bids received on the refundable

PART VII
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT
The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the U.S.
district courts, differs from that under the various other statutes which
it administers. The Commission does not initiate Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings, and it has no authority to determine any
of the issues in such proceedings. The Commission participates in
proceedings under Chapter X in order to provide independent, expert
assistance to the courts, the participants, and investors in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. It pays special attention
to the interests of public security holders who may not otherwise be
represented effectively.
"Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the judge, before approving any plan of reorganization, to submit it to the Commission for its
examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed $3
million, the judge may, if he deems it advisable to do so, submit the
plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it. "Where
the Commission files a report, copies or a summary must be sent to
all security holders and creditors when they are asked to vote on the
plan. The Commission has no authority to veto or to require the
adoption of a plan of reorganization.
The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate to
participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the excessive administrative burden, many of the cases involve only trade or bank creditors
and few public investors. The Commission seeks to participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public investor
interest is involved. However, the Commission may also participate
because an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, public
security holders are not represented adequately, the reorganization
proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions
of the Act, the facts indicate that the Commission can perform a useful
service, or the judge requests the Commission's participation.

REPORT

The Commission has lawyers, accountants and financial analysts

in its New York, Chicago and San Francisco regional offices,who are
engaged actively in Chapter X cases in which the Commission has
filed its appearance. Supervision and review of the regional offices'
Chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate
Regulation of the Commission, which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field office in cases arising in the Atlanta and
Washington, D.C., regional areas.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

In fiscal year 1964, the Commission continued to maintain a high
level of activity under Chapter X. During the year, the Commission
entered its appearance in 14 new proceedings involving companies with
aggregate stated assets of approximately $72 million and aggregate
indebtedness of approximately $70 million. These proceedings involved the rehabilitation of corporations engaged in various businesses
including, among others, real estate and mortgage investments, vending
machine manufacture and distribution, operation of hospitals and
hotels, and manufacture of chemicals and electronic components.
During the year the Commission was a party in a total of 93 reorThe stated
ganization proceedings, including the new proceedings.'
assets of the companies involved in these proceedings totaled approximately $794 million and their indebtedness totaled approximately $748
million. The proceedings were scattered among district courts in
30 states and the District of Columbia, as follows: 15 in New York;
10 in California; 9 in Florida; 6 in Illinois; 5 each in Kentucky and
Michigan; 4 in Oklahoma; 3 each in Iowa, North Carolina, New J ersey, and Pennsylvania; 2 each in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Maryland, Nevada, Texas, and 'Vashington; and 1 each in the District of
Columbia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Ohio, Mississippi, Tennessee,
New Mexico, Connecticut, Wyoming, 'Vest Virginia, Virginia, and
Utah. Proceedings involving 6 principal debtor corporations were
closed during the year. Thus, at the end of the year the Commission
was participating in 87 reorganization proceedings.
JURISDICTIONAL, PROCEDURAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATfERS

In Chapter X proceedings in which it participates, the Commission
seeks application of the procedural and substantive safeguards to which
all parties are entitled. The Commission also attempts in its interpretations of the statutory requirements to encourage uniformity in
the construction of Chapter X and the procedures thereunder.

a complete list of reorganization
which the Commission was a party during the year.

In Beehive Security Th'ioift & Loan,2 the district court granted the
Commission's motion to enjoin a committee organized by a former employee of the debtor from soliciting funds from public investors.
The
Commission stressed, among other things, the dangers inherent in a
committee's private assessment of public investors in light of the
abuses prevalent in equity receivership proceedings prior to the reforms of Chapter X.
In Oertified Oredit Oorpo'i'ation,3 a committee was organized by
certain of the debtor's former officers and directors and other stockholders to represent debentureholders and preferred stockholders in
the proceedings.
Some of the officer members were defendants in a
class suit brought by other investors under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Funds to defray expenses were solicited
by the committee and were turned over immediately to its counsel
who also represented defendant officers in the class suit. The Commission moved to disqualify the committee because of a conflict of
interest and to compel a return of the funds solicited. Prior to a decision, the committee, pursuant to a stipulation, disbanded and agreed to
return all funds collected.
InJoe N eiocomer Finance Oompany,4 a debentureholdors' committee
was enjoined, on motion of the Commission, from further soliciting
contributions from public investors, and the funds already collected
were ordered held in escrow pending a ruling on their disposition.
In Goebel Brewing Oompany," an order entered on the Commission's
motion permanently restrained further solicitation of funds, approved
the committee's accounting which showed that most of the solicited
funds had been returned to investors, and reserved jurisdiction with
respect to a small amount previously disbursed until a hearing on
allowances. In (Ioemo Oapital, Inc.,6 the committee voluntarily agreed
to return the funds collected.
In Maryvale OOmJlJ1lUnity Hospital, lnc.,r the debtor, a charitable
organization, objected to the filing of an involuntary Chapter X petition contending that, since under Section 4b of the Bankruptcy Act a
charitable corporation may become a voluntary but not an involuntary
bankrupt, the court did not have jurisdiction to approve the involuntary petition under Chapter X. In supporting the petition, the Commission urged that Section 4b was inapplicable to Chapter X, since
Section 126 of that Chapter permits creditors to file a petition against

a "corporation," defined in Section 106(3) as any corporation "which
could be adjudged a bankrupt ....
" The Commission also urged
that Section 4b was intended to prevent liquidation in bankruptcy of
a charitable corporation against its will, while Chapter X is designed
for the financial rehabilitation, not the liquidation, of the debtor corporation. The court overruled the objection, and by order, without
opinion, approved the petition.
In General Eoonomics 007'p07'atiun,S the same Chapter X trustees
were appointed for the debtor and for its subsidiaries. Certain stockholders of one subsidiary, General Economics Syndicate, Inc. ("Syndicate"), moved to disqualify the trustees for this subsidiary on the
ground that they were not disinterested within the meaning of Section
158 since they were also trustees for the parent and for another subsidiary against which Syndicate had possible claims. The Commission
urged that a common trusteeship for the parent and subsidiaries was
appropriate for the efficient administration of the estates; that such
common trusteeship was contemplated by Section 129 which permits a
subsidiary to file a Chapter X petition in the parent's Chapter X
proceeding; and that separate trustees should not be required in the
absence of a showing, on a complete record, that an actual and substantial conflict existed. The district court denied the stockholders'
motion, and the court of appeals affirmed on the basis of the arguments
advanced by the Commission." The opinion of the court of appeals
stated that its affirmance would not bar a similar motion in subsequent
stages of the proceedings if a conflict in fact developed.
In Fleetwood Motel Oorporationd" a landlord appealed from the
district court's order denying his petition for possession of leased
property on "Whichthe debtor had built a motel, its sole asset, at a cost
of $1,500,000. The lease provided for its termination upon the filing
of a bankruptcy petition. While Section 70b of the Bankruptcy Act
declares such a forfeiture provision enforceable in bankruptcy, and
Finn v, MeiglUPn, 325 U.S. 300 (1945) had held this provision applicable in Chapter X proceedings, the court of appeals as urged by the
Commission, affirmed, stating that". . . the question of enforceability
of such a covenant is separate and distinct from the question whether
enforcement in a particular case would be consistent with other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act." The court held that it would be inequitable to permit the landlord to secure possession of the debtor's
principal asset as a result of the forfeiture and thereby defeat any p08S.D.N.Y., No. 68-lHJ18.

sibility of a reorganization of the debtor in which the public had a
substantial investment.P
In Goebel Brewing Oompany/2 the trustee recommended court approval of an offer to purchase substantially all of the debtor's assets.
The court ordered the offer rejected, agreeing with the Commission
that a sale which is tantamount to a liquidation should be made only
pursuant to a plan. Subsequently, another offer for substantially all
of the assets was incorporated in a plan which the court approved and
confirmed. In The Sire Plan, Inc.,t3 the district court, over Commission objection, authorized the trustee to sell real estate and a sevenstory steel structure thereon, owned by one of the debtor corporations.
The court of appeals affirmed on the ground that a sale pursuant to a
plan was not required for a partially constructed building, which the
district court had found a "wasting asset." 14
In Hughes Homes, Inc.,t5 the district court denied a motion of the
parent's trade creditors that the separate corporate entities be disregarded and their claims be treated on a parity with the publicly
held debentures of the subsidiary corporations. Committees for debentureholders and the Commission had opposed the motion. The trade
creditors have appealed."
In Doctor's Hospital, Inc.,17 the debtor had sold to the public over
$1,600,000 of bonds, and, as a nonprofit corporation, its bond issue was
exempt from the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The
debtor was reorganized as a for-profit corporation, which assumed the
bonds with substantial modification of their terms. The reorganized
company at first asserted that the assumption of the bonds under the
plan did not involve a "sale" which required compliance with the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939 but subsequently submitted the indenture for
qualification.
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the old management is a requisite under Chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a thorough study of the debtor

to assure the discovery and collection of all assets of the estate, including claims against officers, directors or controlling persons who may
have mismanaged the debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commission
often aids the trustee in his investigation.
In Automatic TVasher Oompany,ts the court ordered, on petition of
the trustee, which the Commission supported, that the stock interests
of Bankers Life & Casualty Company and of Bellanca Corporation
(presently Olson Brothers, Inc.) should be subordinated to the extent
of $1.50 per share of the publicly held stock of the debtor. Subordination was based upon wrongful transactions when each of these companies was the dominant stockholder of the debtor. Both companies
have appealed."
In Equitable Plan Oompa;ny,20 the court authorized the trustee to
accept $600,000in settlement of an action against Manufacturers-Hanover Trust Co. The trustee had alleged, inter alia, that the bank improperly permitted Lowell M. Birrell and others to appropriate substantial sums from the debtor's bank accounts.
In Swan-Finch Oil Corporationr? the trustees settled their action
against Manufacturers-Hanover Trust Co. for $837,500,and Manufacturers withdrew its claim of $8,300 against the debtor for services
rendered as transfer agent. In their action the trustees alleged that
Manufacturers, as depository, transfer agent and custodian for SwanFinch, had, through negligence, aided and abetted Lowell M. Birrell
in the illegal distribution of Swan-Finch stock.22 The settlement of
the claim of Equitable Plan Company against Keta Gas & Oil Company, a subsidiary of Swan-Finch, provides that Equitable be paid
$87,500 in cash and retain 10.8 percent of the outstanding common
stock of Swan-Finch.
The trustees also settled for $25,000 Keta's
counterclaim against Doeskin Products Co., Inc., which has withdrawn
its substantial claim against Swan-Finch.

significant problems. When no such formal report is filed, the Commission may state its views briefly by letter, and authorize its counsel
to make an oral or written presentation to amplify the Commission's
views. During this fiscal year the Commission published one formal
advisory report.28 The Commission conveyed its views to the court
on 13 other plans, on some by oral statement of its counsel at the hearing, and on the others by letter and supporting memoranda."
The formal advisory report relates to Bevis Shell Homes, Ino..
which prior to the Chapter X proceeding was engaged in the construction and sale of shell homes. The plan is predicated in part on the
possibility that the reorganized company may resume construction of
shell homes or may acquire other types of operating companies under
a program of general diversification.
It provides for the retirement of secured indebtedness of over $5 million, held by institutional investors, out of proceeds to be realized
from the liquidation of mortgages and houses in inventory. For the
outstanding publicly-held debentures, totaling about $2 million principal amount, the reorganized company would issue new debentures
of the same principal amount, with interest reduced from 9 to 5 percent, and without compensation for past accruals of interest. The
plan provides for the initial issuance by the reorganized company of
about 1.5 million shares of common stock, 10 cents par value per share,
of which 80 percent is to be distributed to the holder of a note for
$1.1 million which was subordinate to the debentures, and the balance,
together with warrants, is allotted to the publicly-held common stock.
The Commission's report stated that the proposed building and
diversification programs "are too vague and conjectural to be considered as a source of value or earnings for the reorganized company,"
and, insofar as predicated thereon, the plan is not feasible and, in fact,
it "contemplates that these aspects of feasibility are not to be determined by the court but are to be deferred for decision by the management of the reorganized company," after the plan is consummated.
The report further stated that it is not appropriate "under the auspices
of the court to effect a public distribution of securities whose market
prices may reflect in large measure uninformed or speculative appraisals of the conjectural possibilities to which, on this record, no credence

can be given." Treating the plan as essentially a liquidation of present
assets, the report also concludes that the plan is not fair and equitable
since the debentures are not accorded full contractual right to interest,
and since it provides participation
for junior interests, including
stockholders."
In TUT Trailer Fe'!'1'Y,lna.,26 as reported previously;" the district
court approved and confirmed an internal plan of reorganization,
overruling objections by the Commission and the stockholders' committee. On appeal by the committee, which was supported by the
Commission, the court of appeals postponed ruling on the issues on
appeal, with the exception of the issue whether a plan may be confirmed which contemplates that the trustee will become president of
the reorganized company."
It held that the law does not preclude
the employment of the trustee by the reorganized company. It stated,
however, that the trustee would not be disinterested "...
if the proponents of a plan assured him of emoluments and security rather than
merely nominating him for approval by the court and subject to the
usual control of the Board of Directors."
ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid out of the
debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and for
expenses incurred in the proceeding.
The Commission, which under
Section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance from
the estate for the services it renders, has sought to assist the courts in
protecting debtors' estates from excessive charges and at the same
time in allocating compensation equitably on the basis of the claimants' contributions to the administration of estates and the formulation of plans. During
the :fiscal year 205 applications
for
compensation totaling about $5.4 million were reviewed. Two applications raised the question whether an allowance is barred because of
a conflict of interest.
In St. Jolm's View Sites,29 attorneys for holders of deeds of trust
on the debtor's properties :filed a series of suits for damages and other
relief. Prior to the Chapter X proceeding, these attorneys secured
a purchaser for the properties and thereafter the Chapter X proceeding was initiated apparently as the means for effectuating the sale

and conveying clear title to the purchaser. By separate contract the
purchaser was required to pay these attorneys $10,000 as additional
compensation for services to be performed in the Chapter X proceeding. This agreement was not disclosed to the court until sometime
after confirmation of the plan of reorganization pursuant to which the
properties were sold to the purchaser. The attorneys requested a fee
of $184,500, and the Commission recommended a fee of $75,000 less
the $10,000for an estimated 5,000 hours of compensable services before
and during the Chapter X proceeding. Subsequently, the Commission filed a memorandum stating that the contract with the purchaser
gave rise to a conflict of interest; that under Woods v. Oity Nationai
Bank &: Trust 00., 312 U.S. 262, 268 (1941), a conflict of interest is
a bar to any allowance; and that some courts have indicated that in
special circumstances a conflict of interest may be ground for reduction of an allowance. The special master recommended the full
amount requested but, on exceptions filed by the Commission, the district court allowed $100,000.
In Windermere Hotel 00mpany,30 the Commission recommended
that the attorneys for the plan proponent who was the purchaser of
the property of the estate should be denied compensation because
the interests of their client were adverse to the interests of the estate
and of the bondholders who received the net proceeds of the sale. The
court, however, awarded the attorneys compensation in the amount
recommended by the special master whose report, adopted by the
court, concluded that any conflict was practically eliminated since
the property was sold at public auction in excess of its appraised
value, and the plan proponent had dealt at arms-length with the
trustee."
In Hudson &: Manhattan Railroad 00mpany,32 in which the Commission submitted its recommendations in the previous fiscal year, the
district court rendered its decision awarding, exclusive of interim
allowances, final allowances totaling $1,162,000to groups of 30 applicants who had applied for compensation totaling $2,441,000.33 The
Commission had recommended allowances totaling $1,183,000. The
district court stated that it " ... has, in accordance with the policy
laid down by the courts, given great weight to the recommendations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission as being an independent
agency." The court also stressed the need for economy in the allowance of fees, stating: "In granting allowances in a situation such as
this it is impossible to make allowances commensurate with fees

which would be received in ordinary matters. Just as some of the
creditors of the debtor had to take some loss, so the attorney and
'Committees participating in the proceeding cannot be expected to be
paid what they would be paid by an ordinary client." 34
Counsel for one of the committees requested an allowance of $93,000,
computed on the basis of $50 per hour for partners and $20 per hour
for associates. The court, agreeing with the Commission's recommendation, allowed $50,000, stating that the hourly rates proposed by
the applicant were "... inappropriate for compensable services in a
Chapter X proceeding." The court denied another applicant's re-quest for $6,000 and allowed $4,000. The Commission had not objected to this application because the request was small but the court
said that it did not believe "... that applications for high allowances
should be approved merely because they constituted a 'small request'."
The court disallowed several applications, as recommended by the
Commission, because of the bar under Section 249. That Section was
held applicable to counsel for certain bondholders, where one of the
firm's partners, as co-executor of his father's estate, had sold bonds of
the debtor held in the estate and both partners of the firm were to share
in the proceeds of the estate." However, the court awarded an allowance to co-counsel for the same bondholders in an amount recommended by the Commission, stating: "The Court agrees with the conclusion of the SEC that there was not that degree of intimacy among
counsel that would call for this Court to bar compensation to co-counsel

Of eight applications for leave to appeal, the courts of appeals

INTERVENTION IN CHAPTER XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision. Where a proceeding is brought under that
'Chapter but the facts indicate that it should have been brought under
Chapter X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes the Commission to
make application to the court to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding
unless the debtor's petition is amended to comply with the requirements of Chapter X, or a creditors' petition under Chapter X is filed.

race track in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, proposed
an arrangement under which they would issue new '{ percent noncumulative income debentures in exchange for the '{ percent fixed
interest debentures held by the public. The new debentures would
not have a sinking fund but would contain a more favorable convertible feature. The debtor's two classes of stock, 30 percent of which
is owned by the debtor's officers and directors, would not be affected.
The Commission's motion under Section 328 stated, inter alia, that the
provisions of the proposed arrangement raised substantial questions as
to fairness and equity with respect to the publicly-held debentures,
which required the application of the procedural and substantive
safeguards found only in Chapter X. The court denied the Commission's motion, and the Commission has appealed."
Motions under Section 328 were filed by the Commission and were
granted in BarOhris Oonetruotion. Corporation. 38 and Hydrocarbon

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACf OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which meets
the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of
holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected and
enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable
financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The
Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill "in the exercise
of the rights and powers invested in it by the indenture" as a prudent
man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must be
contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities
which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

PART IX
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
OF 1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration.
and regulation of companies primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. The.
Act, among other things, requires disclosure of the finances and investment policies of such companies; prohibits changing the nature of
their business or their investment policies without shareholder approval; regulates the means of custody of the companies' assets; requires management contracts to be submitted to security holders for
approval; prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers
from constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies; and prohibits transactions between such companies and their
officers, directors, and affiliates except with approval of the Commission. The Act also regulates the issuance of senior securities and
requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their certificates.
The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities Act of
1933 and the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies
are also subject to the Commission's proxy rules and closed-end companies are subject to "insider" trading rules.
COMPANmS REGISTERED UNDER THE ACf

As of June 30, 1964, there were 731 investment companies registered
under the Act, including 72 small business investment companies, Of
this total, 617 were "active" companies, whose assets had an
aggregate market value of approximately $41.6 billion. Compared
with the corresponding totals at June 30, 1963, these figures represent
an overall increase of approximately $5.6 billion in the market value
of assets, while the number of registered companies increased by four.
The classification of the registered companies and the respective approximate market values of the assets in each category as of June 30,
1964, are shown in the table on p. 111.

until such time 8.~ the Comnnssion issues orders under Section 8(f) of the Investment Company Act terminating their regtstrations •
• Durmg the year, one company changed Its classification from closed-end to open-end.

The approximately $2,856,000,000 of assets of the 107 "active" registered unit investment trusts includes approximately $2,406,000,000
of assets of 54 registered unit investment trusts which invest in securities of other registered investment companies, substantially all of
which are of the open-end type.
During the fiscal year, 52 new companies, including 2 small business
investment companies, registered under the Act while the registrations of 48 companies, including 1 small business investment company,
were terminated.
The classification of these companies is as follows:

INSPECTION AM) INVESTIGATION PROGRAM

During the fiscal year 1964 a total of 146 investment company inspections was completed pursuant to the statutory authority conferred on
the Commission by Section 31 (b) of the Investment Company Act.
This represented a 76.5 percent increase over the 84 inspections of the
fiscal year. ~ h e s einspections were planned and supervised
bv the Branch of Inspections and Investigations which was established
d;ring fiscal 1963 in the Division of Corporate Regulation.
I n furtherance of the Investment Company Act training program
for staff members, short seminars on Investment Company Act problems and inspection techniques were conducted by members of the
Branch of Inspections and Investigations a t the regional offices in
Denver, Seattle, Fort Worth, and Atlanta. A longer course was conducted at the Washington Regional Officein view of the expectation
that increased responsibility for the investment company inspection
program will be delegated to that office.
A large number of the inspections disclosed violations not only of
the Investment Company Act but also of other statutes administered

THIRTIETH

ANNUAL

REPORT

113

by the Commission. Although violations of the Investment Company
Act which were uncovered were frequently of a relatively minor nature
and were quickly corrected when called to the attention of the company involv-ed, a number were more serious in character.
These included inadequate arrangements for safekeeping of the investment
company's portfolio securities or failure to observe the safekeeping
procedures which had been established.
In several instances, the
fidelity bonds maintained by the investment company pursuant to
Section 17 (g) of the Act were found to be inadequate in relation to
the company's assets. In one instance it was found that the investment company did not in fact maintain an office at the address given
in its prospectus as its head office, and that its books and records were
being kept outside the United States. The inspections also disclosed
several situations in which the procedures for pricing shares for purposes of purchase or redemption were not in conformity with the
statute or the company's prospectus.
Several instances were found in
which investment company shares were not redeemed within the
required statutory period. The inspections further exposed a number
of instances in which transactions violating Section 17 of the Act were
effected by affiliated persons.
Largely as an outgrowth of information obtained during the inspections, 33 private investigations were commenced during the fiscal
year; and, on the basis of the facts obtained, five civil actions seeking
injunctions, involving six investment companies, were instituted by
the Commission. Two of these actions sought to enjoin further
activity by unregistered investment companies,- The complaint in
one case (Max J. Royer) alleged violation of the proxy filing requirements of the Act, while in the other matter (Midland Basic'; the complaint sought the appointment of a trustee and injunctions against
two of the company's officers and directors for serving in those capacities while permanently enjoined by court order, in violation of Section
9 (a) of the Act. In connection with this matter, a subpoena enforcement action was instituted,"
In S.E.O. v. Oontinental Growth Fund,
Ino.,3 the complaint alleged, among other things, conversion, failure
to maintain a fidelity bond, unlawful transactions with affiliated persons, and sale of shares at other than the current public offering price.

investment trust which had abandoned its duties as a depositor, the
appointment of a receiver was requested. And in E.E.a. v. James J.
Ling, et 01.,5 the complaint alleged, among other things, that affiliated
persons of Electro-Science Investors, Inc., had entered into transactions with that investment company amounting to gross abuse of
trust.
Settlements beneficial to shareholders of investment companies were
obtained in two instances. In one, the investment company's president
had, in effect, converted substantial sums due to failure of the bank
which was custodian of the fund's assets to exercise minimal standards
of custodial care. The settlement resulted in the return of approximately $220,300 to the company." In the other instance, the principal
underwriter and investment adviser for two registered investment
companies had received substantial brokerage commissions on portfolio transactions which could have been executed directly without
the payment of commissions, and transactions involving affiliated persons had been effected in violation of Section 17. As a result of administrative proceedings brought against the principal underwriter
and investment adviser, a settlement was effected by which more than
$400,000was returned to the two investment companies.
As a consequence of the training courses and the experience gained
by participation in inspections and investigations, a number of the
various regional officesof the Commission have assumed an increased
responsibility in the inspection program as well as in the processing
of formal investigations under the Investment Company Act.
SPECIAL STAFF STUDY OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

During fiscal year 1963 the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania submitted to the Commission its Study of Mutual Funds,
which the Commission in turn submitted to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives.' The Study,
based on responses to questionnaires, constitutes the most comprehensive analysis of the mutual fund industry since the Commission's study
made prior to the adoption of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
It analyzes the growth, organization and control, investment policy
and performance of open-end investment companies (popularly known
as mutual funds), their impact on securities markets, the extent of
control of portfolio companies, and the financial and other relationships of mutual funds with their investment advisers and principal
underwriters.

As the Commission stated in its transmittal letter, many of the comments in the Study raise questions of broad policy whether some of the
practices and patterns which originated in an earlier time and under
different conditions and which have become conventional within the
broad tolerances of the 1940 Act should be reconsidered. The study
draws attention to the potential for divided loyalties arising from the
typical structure of the industry under which a significant part of the
funds' activities is performed by affiliated organizations such as advisers, underwriters, and brokers, who control or are represented on
the boards of directors of the funds. Questions are also raised as to
the relationship, or lack of relationship, between, on the one hand, the
growth, size and performance of mutual funds, and, on the other hand,
sales commissions, other sales incentives, advisory fees and costs of
operation of the mutual funds and of the advisers, including fees
charged by advisers to other clients. The Study comments upon the
role of and in general questions the effectiveness of "unaffiliated" directors of the typical mutual fund.
In forwarding the Study to the Congress, the Commission stated
that it would be premature to attempt an evaluation of the conclusions
in the Study, but that it was apparent that the Commission's rules
under the 1940 Act and indeed some of the provisions of the statute
itself might require reassessment. The Commission accordingly directed its staff to conduct a detailed evaluation of the Study with a view
to making such recommendations as may seem appropriate,"
This
evaluation in which members of the staff of the Division of Corporate
Regulation were engaged throughout fiscal 1964 includes a review of
the structure and operations of the investment company industry generally, and a reassessment of the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Commission's rules and regulations thereunder.
The Special Study of Securities Markets considered certain aspects
of the investment company industry not covered by the Wharton
School Study, namely, sales techniques, the adequacy of training and
supervision of salesmen, "contractual" or "front-end load" plans for
the purchase of investment company shares and the possible use of
inside information with respect to portfolio transactions by those
closely affiliated with investment companies. The conclusions and
recommendations of the Special Study in these areas are contained
in Chapter XI of the Special Study Report," transmitted by the Commission to the Congress early in fiscal 1964. In one of the areas
covered, that of contractual plans, the Special Study's Report suggested that the Commission recommend legislation amending the Act's
«r«. at pp.

provisions relating to such plans, that consideration be given to the
abolition of any future front-end load or, if it should be concluded
that abolition was not called for, that the legislation should both
substantially limit the amount and method of application of any such
load and prohibit the offering of front-end load contractual plans
without the simultaneous offering of a level-load voluntary plan.I0
During fiscal 1964 the Association of Mutual Fund Plan Sponsors
submitted to the Commission a statement in reply to the findings and
recommendations of the Special Study regarding contractual plans.
A t the end of fiscal 1964 the Commission had this reply under
consideration.
It is expected that the staff study will be completed during fiscal
1965, and that the staff's analysis, together with the reports of the
Wharton School and of the Special Study of Securities Markets, will
aid the Commission in determining whether to submit recommendations to the Congress for amendment of the Investment Company Act
and what action, if any, should be taken to strengthen the rules and
regulations under the Act.
CURRENT INFORMATION

The Commission's rules promulgated under the Act require that
the basic information contained in notifications of registration and in
registration statements of investment companies be kept current,
through periodic and other reports, except in cases of certain inactive
unit trusts and face-amount certificate coml;anies. The following
reports and documents were filed during the 1964 fiscal year:

Other Sections, such as 6(d), 9(b), 10(f), 17(b), 17(d), and 23(c),
contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of the Act or
may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under certain provisions of Sections 2,3, and 8 the Commission may determine the status
of persons and companies under the Act. One of the principal activities of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is the
consideration of applications for orders under the sections referred
to.
During the fiscal year, 245 applications filed under various sections
of the Investment Company Act were before the Commission. The

Some of the more significant matters in which applications were
considered are summarized below :
On June lS, 19.964, the Commission issued notice" that
Industrial Fund, Inc. and Financial Industrial Income Fund, Inc.
("the funds"), two open-end investment companies, and Financial
Programs, Inc. ("Programs"), had filed an application under Section
6 ( c ) for an order exempting them from the provisions of Section 15
of the Act to the extedt that that section might be deemed to prevent
U

Investment Company dft Release No. 8997.

118

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Programs from serving as investment adviser of and principal underwriter for the funds.
Prior to the filing of the application, the Division of Corporate
Regulation had conducted a private investigation, as a result of
which it concluded that the investment advisory and principal underwriting contracts between Programs and the funds had been assigned,
and therefore terminated, on or about January 2, 1964, as a result
of the execution of certain contracts for the sale of approximately
87 percent of the voting and nonvoting stock of Programs, and the
occurrence of certain related events.
Wbile the application did not concede the validity of the Division's
position with respect to the assignment of the investment advisory
and underwriting contracts, it proposed a basis for compromise of
the matter involving the acceptance by Programs, subject to approval
of the shareholders of the funds, of reduced fees based on the cost
of rendering advisory and underwriting services for the period from
January 2, 1964, to the date of the requested order. Shortly after
the close of the fiscal year the application was granted by the

Commission."
As noted at p. 106 of the Commission's 29th Annual Report, on
December 19, 1962, Randolph Phillips, a stockholder of Investors
Mutual, Inc. and other registered open-end investment companies for
which Investors Diversified Services, Inc. ("IDS") (also a registered
investment company) serves as investment adviser, filed an application under Section 2(a) (9) of the Act requesting a determination
that Bertin C. Gamble, Gamble-Skogmo, Inc., and General Outdoor
Advertising Company, acting collectively (referred to in the application as the "Gamble Group") , either alone or in concert with John
D. Murchison, Clint W. Murchison, Jr. and others (referred to as
the "Murchison Group"), had acquired control of Alleghany Corporation ("Alleghany"), and of IDS, about 47.5 percent of whose voting securities were owned by Alleghany. On January 2, 1963, the
Commission ordered that a hearing be held with respect to these questions of control." On February 15, 1963, IDS filed an application
under Section 2 (a) (9) seeking determinations that (a) Murchison
Brothers; (b) Allan P. Kirby, Sr.; (c) Kirby and certain associates;
and (d) Murray D. Lincoln and/or companies controlled by or as12 On JUly 8, 1964, the Commission Issued Its Memorandum Opinion and Order (Investment Company Act Release No. 4009) granting the exemption sought by the application,
conditioned on the approval by the shareholders of the funds of the modified payments by
the funds to Programs.
The Commission's opinion noted that the order dId not "constitute authorization for the proposed payments or approval of the amounts thereof" but
was "intended only to remove a possible statutory bar to consummation of tbe proposed
compromise."

sociated with him, controlled Alleghany and that Alleghany controlled
IDS. This application was consolidated for purposes of hearing with
the Phillips application."
The hearings in these consolidated proceedings were concluded in September 1963, and in June 1964, the
hearing examiner filed a recommended decision in which he determined, among other things, that the Gamble Group did not "control"
Alleghany or IDS, as asserted by Phillips. Exceptions to the recommended decision were filed after the close of the fiscal year.
Hearings were reopened on an application originally filed in 1961
by International Bank, an Arizona corporation, for an order declaring, pursuant to Section 3 (b) (2) of the Act, that it was not an investment company." Although the Commission granted the application,
it rejected applicant's contention that a company which owns securities as an incident to the operations of its majority-owned subsidiary
and of its controlled companies is not "in the business" of owning and
holding such securities and is therefore not an investment company
within the definition of Section 3(a) (3) of the Act. The Commission held that the section's applicability is not limited to situations
where securities are held "merely as investments." However, the
Commission concluded that applicant was primarily engaged in noninvestment businesses and entitled to the order sought since (a)
approximately two-thirds of applicant's total assets were represented
by noninvestment businesses engaged in by it directly, through
majority-owned subsidiaries, and through controlled companies conducting the business of banking, and (b) over two-thirds of its net
income was derived from such businesses."
During the fiscal year, Townsend Oorporation of America ("TCA"),
and Townsend M anaqement Corporation ("TMC"), both registered
closed-end investment companies, sought an exemption pursuant to
Section 17(b) of the Act, and approval pursuant to Section 23( c) (3),
with respect to transactions incident to a plan of merger of TCA,
TMC and Resort Airlines, Inc., all of which are affiliated companies.
The plan grew out of a proceeding instituted by the Commission in
the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, in which the
Commission alleged violations by TeA, TMC and certain controlling
individuals of various provisions of the Act and sought injunctive
relief and an order requiring that action be taken to effectuate compliance with the Act.n The district court took possession of TCA
and TMC for the purpose of enforcing compliance, enjoined the defendants from violations of the Act, appointed an interim board of

directors to carry out the terms of its decree, and ordered that TCA

the Commission found, subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, that
the terms of the merger plan were reasonable and fair and did not involve overreaching, that the transactions were consistent with the
policies of the companies and the general purposes of the Act, and
that the purchases by TCA and T.MC of securities of which they were
the issuers were to be made on a basis which would not unfairly discriminate against the holders of the classes of securities to be purchased. Accordingly, it granted the relief requested."

PART X
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT

OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 establishes a pattern of regulation of investment advisers similar to that contained in the Securities Exchange Act with respect to the conduct of brokers and dealers.
With certain specified exceptions, the Act requires persons engaged
for compensation in the business of advising others with respect to
securities to register with the Commission, and requires investment
advisers to conform to statutory standards designed to protect the
public interest. The Act prohibits fraudulent conduct, and authorizes the Commission to define, and prescribe means reasonably designed
to prevent, fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts or practices.
Pursuant to such authority, the Commission has adopted a Rule
(206 (4)-1) relating to advertising practices, which, among other
things, proscribes the use of testimonials, circumscribes permissible
references to past recommendations and the use of graphs and charts,
and prohibits the use of false or misleading statements. Under another Rule (206(4)-2), an investment adviser who has custody or
possession of the funds or securities of clients must segregate them,
maintain them in the manner provided in the rule and comply with
certain other conditions.
The Act prohibits an inv-estment adviser from basing his compensation upon a share of the capital gains or appreciation of his client's
funds, and prohibits the assignment of investment advisory contracts
without the client's consent. Advisers are also required to make, keep
and preserve books and records in accordance with the Commission's
rules and the Commission is empowered to conduct inspections of
such books and records.
Investment advisers who violate any of the provisions of the Act
Or of the rules thereunder are subject to appropriate administrative,
civil or criminal remedies. With respect to administrative remedies,
the Act provides, in Section 203(d), that the Commission shall deny,
revoke, or suspend for not more than 12 months, the registration of
an investment adviser if it finds that such action is in the public interest
and that the investment adviser or any partner, officer, director or
121

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

controlling or controlled person of the investment adviser is subject
to a specified disqualification. These disqualifications include wilful
misstatements in an application or report filed with the Commission,
the existence of a conviction or injunction based on or related to specified types of misconduct, wilful violation of any provision of the Securities Act, Securities Exchange Act or Investment Advisers Act or
any rule or regulation thereunder, or aiding and abetting any other
person's violation of such provisions, rules or regulations. In addition, the Commission may seek injunctions to restrain violations of
the Act and may recommend criminal prosecution by the Department
of Justice for fraudulent misconduct or wilful violation of the Act or
the Commission's rules thereunder.
Inspection

Program

During fiscal 1964, 239 inspections of investment advisers were completed by the Commission's staff (as compared to 219 the preceding
year) . These inspections disclosed a total of 182 indicated violations
of the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as
reflected in the following table:

Administrative Proceedings

The Commission instituted revocation proceedings against seven
investment advisers during fiscal year 1964 and initiated two proceedings to determine whether applications for registration should be
denied. During the year, it revoked the registrations of six advisers
and denied one application. At the close of the fiscal year 13 revocation proceedings and 1 denial proceeding were pending. Those proceedings concluded during the year included the following:

ANNUAL REPORT

123

Anne Robin, a registered investment adviser, violated the Act by
failing to disclose in her registration application or by amendment
that Ben Robin, her husband, exercised a controlling influence
over the business. It further found that the Robins circulated
misleading advertisements which represented that "The Profitmaker," a weekly market letter published by them, was staffed by
trained and experienced securities analysts and experts, and that each
stock discussed in the market letter had the potential of advancing
100 percent within a year. In addition, the Commission found that
respondents engaged in fraudulent conduct by publishing an unverified and in fact false tip that a manufacturer, whose stock they recommended, had just received a large government contract. The Commission stated that advisers must meet the same "high degree of care
required to insure accurate and adequate representations concerning
securities discussed in printed advisory material distributed by a
broker-dealer," and that if anything the deception was enhanced
rather than dissipated by the use of a qualification at the end of the
market letter that "information in this letter is not guaranteed but
is gathered :from sources we believe to be accurate." Revocation of
registrant's registration was found to be in the public interest in view
of the serious violations found.
Justin Federman Stone 2-The Commission :found that in the course
of a publicity campaign designed to gain subscribers for Stone's advisory service, misrepresentations were made concerning the acceptance of the service by institutional investors. In addition, misleading
statements were made to the effect that Stone's :formula employed
"miracle working computer-type techniques" resulting in "uncannily
correct anticipation of market trends," and that the profitable results
of the system had been proven by "exhaustive" tests. In concluding
that Stone violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Act, the Commission noted that the publicity material conveyed the :falseimpression
that the advisory service provided an accurate mathematical device
:for determining when to buy and sell which had been proven by extensive tests and was widely acclaimed by experienced securities specialists
and institutions. Stone's contention that the violations were attributable to his public relations counsellor and therefore not wilful was
rejected, the Commission finding that Stone knew of and made no
serious attempt to correct the misrepresentations and failed to meet
his responsibility to comply with the Act. The Commission concluded
that it was in the public interest to revoke Stone's registration .

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION
CIVIL LITIGATION

The several statutes administered by the Commission authorize the
Commission to seek injunctions against continuing or threatened violations of such statutes. Such violations may involve a wide range of
illegal practices, including the purchase or sale of securities by fraud,
and the sale of securities without compliance with the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. The Commission also participates
in various other types of proceedings, including appearances as amicus
curiae in litigation between private parties where it is important that
its views regarding the interpretation of the statutes be furnished to
the court.
At the beginning of fiscal year 1964 there were pending in the
courts 121 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices in
the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 84 additional proceedings were instituted and 104 cases were disposed of, leaving 101
such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 6 proceedings in the
district courts under Section 11(e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act; and in 7 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also participated in 49 civil appeals in the U.S. courts of appeals. Of these, 17
came before the courts on petitions for review of administrative
order, 12 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission had taken an active part, 12 were appeals in actions brought by or
against the Commission, 1 was an appeal from orders entered pursuant
to Section 11(e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 7
were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amicus
curiae. The Commission also participated in 8 appeals or petitions
for writs of certiorari before the U.S. Supreme Court resulting from
these or similar actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or state court, either as a party or as amiou« curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are

contained in the appendix tables. TIllS section describes a few of the
more noteworthy cases, not including, however, cases arising under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act or Chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act; cases arising under those statutes are discussed in the sections of
this report dealing with such statutes.
In J. I. Oase 00. v. Borak,t the Supreme Court, accepting the views
urged by the Commission as amicus curiae, held that in a private suit
based upon alleged violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and the proxy rules thereunder a Federal district court has
jurisdiction to grant "all necessary remedial relief" and is not limited
to the granting of "prospective" or declaratory relief as was held in
Dann v. Studebaker-Packard
00rp.2 Noting that the purpose of Section 14(a) "is to prevent management or others from obtaining authorization for corporate action by means of deceptive or inadequate
disclosure in proxy SOlicitation," the Court held that "it is the duty
of the courts to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to
make effective the congressional purpose." The Court also rejected
the contention that a stockholders' derivative action may not be
brought under the proxy rules, thereby implicitly overruling the
decision in Howard v. Furst,3 and indicated that the private right of
action under the proxy rules may not be frustrated by such state law
"hurdles" as security-for-expense statutes.
During the fiscal year, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,
in The Prudential, Insurance Oompany of America v. Securities and
Exchange 00mmission,3& affirmed an order of the Commission 3b declaring that the "Investment Fund" resulting from the proposed sale
of variable annuity contracts by Prudential would be an investment.
company required to be registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, notwithstanding the fact that Prudential, as an insurance
company, was excepted from the coverage of the Act. The court upheld the Commission's determination that the variable annuity contracts would constitute the purchasers thereof an "organized group of
persons," that such contracts would create a "trust" held by Prudential for the purchasers and that the separate Investment Fund would
be a "fund," all within the meaning of those terms as contained in the
statutory definition of "company," and that the Investment Fund
would be the "issuer" of the contracts for Investment Company Act
purposes. It rejected arguments, among others, that the term "fund"
referred only to recognizable business entities, that the existence in

the Act of a specific exemption for common trust funds showed that
regulation under the Act was imposed on an institutional rather than
functional basis, and that the exemption for insurance companies was
based upon the existence of adequate state regulation.
The court
concluded by stating that "the mere fact that the investment program in the case at bar is under the aegis of an insurance company
ought not to negate compliance with [safeguards provided by the Act
for investors in securities] in the absence of compeling circumstances."
Two cases, Hersh v. Securities and Exchange Commission. 4 and
Lite v. Securities and Exchange Oommission,5 arose from an order
issued by the Commission revoking the broker-dealer registration of
J. Logan & Co., expelling the company from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and finding that various
officers and employees of the company, including Hersh and Lile, were
each a cause of the revocation and expulsion." The Commission found
that the company, aided and abetted by Hersh and Lile, had engaged
III the practices of "churning"
its customers' accounts and of "switching" securities back and forth between customers. The company had
induced its customers to place complete reliance on it and its salesmen
to act in the customers' best interests and had then taken gross advantage of the customers' trust and confidence by generating excessive
transactions in their accounts and by recommending the purchase of
a security to one customer while simultaneously persuading another
customer to sell the same security, all in complete disregard of the
financial welfare or investment aims of the customers, the objective
being rather to produce brokerage fees and profits for the company and
its salesmen. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, holding
that the findings as to Hersh were supported by substantial evidence,
affirmed the order as to him on the basis of the opinion of the Commission. The court dismissed Lile's petition for review on the ground
that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter by virtue of Lile's
failure to urge before the Commission any of the objections raised
in his petition.
In its motion to dismiss Lile's petition for review, the Commission
had urged, as an alternative ground for dismissal, that the court lacked
jurisdiction by virtue of Lile's failure to file his petition within 60
days after the "entry" of the Commission's order, as required by
Section 25 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act. The court rejected
that argument on the ground that the Commission does not maintain
a court-type docket from which the precise date of the "entry" of its
orders can be determined. The court apparently construed the Com• 325 F. 2d 147 (C.A. 9,1963).

mission's Rules of Practice as requiring that such a docket be maintained. To avoid the uncertainty created by the Lile decision, the
Commission subsequently amended its Rules of Practice. 7
In three cases this year, Securities and EaJchange Oommission v.
Bill Willoughby Ooin Eeehanqe, et al.,8Securities and EaJchange Oommission v, Space Oity Investments, Inc., et al.,9 and Securities and
Exchange Oomonission. v. Oomstook Ooin 00., et al.,10 the Commission
sought injunctions against violation of the registration provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933 in the offer and sale of investment contracts
and certificates of interest and participation in profit-sharing agreements issued in connection with coin investment programs. The
defendants had solicited funds from investors, agreeing to use the
funds in the purchase and sale of coins and to share the profits derived
therefrom with the investors. The defendants in all three cases consented to the entry of permanent injunctions.
The Commission filed a complaint against Oontinental Growth
Fund, Ino., et al.,l1 an investment company registered as such with
the Commission, and certain of its officers and directors, seeking to
enjoin the individual defendants from continuing to act as officers
and directors on the ground that they had been guilty of gross misconduct and gross abuse of trust. The Commission also asked for the appointment of a receiver for the firm's assets. The complaint charged,
among other things, that Richard C. Jacobs, a promoter of the Fund
and its former president and director, embezzled $69,000 of the Fund's
monies through a scheme by which he caused the Franklin National
Bank as custodian to disburse monies for sham stock purchases by the
Fund. The complaint also alleged that Jacobs caused the Fund to
deviate from its stated investment policy, that the directors permitted
the Fund to operate without a fidelity insurance bond to protect the
Fund against larceny and embezzlement and without necessary books
and records, that the net asset value at which it sold and redeemed its
shares was improperly computed and that Jacobs sold securties to
the Fund in violation of the Investment Company Act. The court
appointed a receiver for the assets and property of the Fund and the
remaining issues were pending at the close of the year.
The Commission filed a complaint against James J. Ling, Royce B.

The complaint alleged, among other things, that Ling, with the assistance of the other defendants, took personal advantage of a corporate
opportunity of the company to purchase and resell a large block of common stock of Tamar Electronics Industries, Inc., and that he realized
substantial personal profits from the transaction which rightfully
belonged to the investment company. The complaint seeks an order
directing the defendants to account for and return such profits to the
company and also seeks an injunction, pursuant to Section 36 of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, preventing any of the defendants
from serving in specified capacities for a registered investment
company.
In Securities and Eeohamqe Oommission v. United States Diversified Industries (lorporation: Jack Yetman and Leonard James,13 the
district court issued a mandatory injunction directing the defendants
to file with the Commission an annual report of the company for the
year ended December 31, 1961. The common stock of the company
was registered on the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, a national securities exchange, until February 16, 1962,when it was delisted. The fact
that the stock was delisted was held not to relieve the company of the
obligation to file an annual report covering the last year during which
the stock was still listed.
Gilson v. Ohook Full O'Nuts Oorporation. 14 was an action by a
stockholder and his attorney seeking allowance of attorney's fees
out of a fund paid to Chock Full O'Nuts Corporation by certain
of its officers and directors in settlement of suits instituted against
them by the corporation to recover "short-swing" trading' profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. According to
the complaint, the stockholder's attorney had investigated possible
liability of the insiders to the corporation under Section 16(b) and
then had made demand on the corporation on April 10, 1962,that suit
be instituted by May 31, 1962,as the statute of limitations would otherwise expire on June 2, 1962. After the corporation replied on April
16, t962,. that its preliminary investigation indicated that no violations had occurred, the stockholder's attorney prepared a complaint,
On May 31, 1962,however, the corporation commenced actions against
the insiders, resulting in the settlement. The district court granted
defendant corporation's motion to dismiss, ruling that the awarding
of attorneys' fees is limited to situations where the recovery to the
corporation under Section 16(b) has resulted from a suit successfully
prosecuted by the stockholder. IS

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, agreeing
with the views expressed in a brief of the Commission filed as amious
curiae, reversed." After granting the corporation's petition for rehearing en bane, the full bench reversed the district court and held
that an attorney who did "considerably more than simple preparation of the statutory request to the corporation to sue" was entitled to
fees from the corporation after its successful suit. The court emphasized, however, that it was not deciding the question whether a stockholder's attorney is entitled to compensation from a corporation where
he has done "nothing more than find a claim for the recovery of 'shortswing' profits under Section 16 (b) ... which the corporation then
successfully brings at the stockholder's request." 17
In Levitt v. Johnson/8 a stockholder of an investment company,
Fidelity Capital Fund, Inc., brought a derivative action on behalf of
himself, the Fund, and other similarly situated stockholders of the
Fund against the Fund's directors, its corporate investment adviser,
and its corporate underwriter.
The complaint alleged inter alia
(1) that the investment advisory fees had been and would continue
to be "grossly excessive, unreasonable and illegal and out of proportion to the value of the services rendered" by the adviser and were a
"waste and gift of the Fund's assets," in violation of Section 37 of the
Investment Company Act and (2) that because of the degree of affiliation of the directors of the Fund with the directors of the adviser and
the underwriter, the contracts and agreements for advisory and underwriting services, and all renewals and extensions thereof, were made
in violation of Sections 10(a) and 10 (b) of the Act and were thus null
and void under Section 47 of the Act. The complaint stated that
demand had not been made upon the directors of the Fund to bring
this action, since they were to be named as defendants, nor had demand
been made upon the stockholders, since that was assertedly unnecessary
and futile for the reason, among others, that there were more than
48,000 stockholders scattered all over the United States and that to
require demand upon these stockholders to take action would cast an
unconscionable financial burden upon the plaintiff and would involve
the conduct of a proxy fight entailing prohibitive expenses.
Motions to dismiss the complaint were filed by the defendants on
the ground, inter alia, that the complaint failed to state a claim upon
which relief could be granted. The District Court for the District
of Massachusetts found that Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure had been complied with but dismissed the complaint for

failure by plaintiff to plead compliance "with the strict Massachusetts
rule as to prior demand upon his fellow shareholders in Fund." 19
.!n appeal was taken from the district court's dismissal of the complaint and the Commission filed a brief amicus curiae in support of
the appellant. The Commission took no position on the merits of the
case. On July 8,196,1"the court of appeals, in vacating the judgment
of the district court, held that demand upon the other stockholders of
the Fund in the circumstances of this case would be a "pointless or,
alternatively, impossibly burdensome act [and] ... should be excused." The court also held that the "strict Massachusetts rule" of
demand upon stockholders would conflict with the broad declaration of
policy contained in Section 1(b) of the Act; it is therefore "the type
of hurdle that the Investment Company Act .•• forbids."
During the fiscal year the Commission was granted leave to participate amicus curiae in lJliller v, General Outdoor Advertising Oorp.,
et al.,20 a case involving the question of the applicability of Section
16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934to transactions involving
the acquisition of options to purchase and sell securities of a class
registered on a national securities exchange. The complaint in this
case had alleged that the defendants and the Murchison Brothers, a
partnership, had entered into a so-called agreement of put and call,
whereby the defendants acquired the right to purchase from Murchison Brothers and Murchison Brothers acquired the right to sell to
the defendants certain shares of common stock of Alleghany Corporation, and that within a 6-month period the defendants entered into a
contract to sell the stock, thus giving rise to liability for profits under
Section 16(b). An appeal was taken from the order of the district
court granting defendants' motion for summary judgment."
The
Commission filed a brief amicus curiae urging that the agreement of
put and call constituted a purchase of the Alleghany common stock
by the defendants against which a sale within a 6-month period could
be matched for the purpose of determining liability under Section
16(b) . At the end of the fiscal year the appeal was still pending.
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

The statutes administered by the Commission provide that the Commission may transmit evidence of violations of any provisions of these
statutes to the Attorney General, who in turn may institute criminal
proceedings. Where facts ascertained as a result of an investigation

During fiscal year 1964 the Commission referred 50 cases to the
Department of Justice for prosecution. In the course of the year,
39 indictments were returned against 95 defendants in cases referred
prior to and during the fiscal year, 2 criminal contempt actions were
filed, and 93 convictions were obtained in 46 cases, while convictions
were affirmedin 12cases.
From 1934, when the Commission was established, until June 30,
1964,3,408 defendants have been indicted in the U.S. district courts
in 811 cases developed by the Commission and 1,774 convictions.have

Commission."
As in prior years, the majority of the criminal cases prosecuted
involved the offer and sale of securities by fraudulent representations
and other fraudulent practices. These activities included high-pressure long-distance telephone "boiler-room" frauds, conversion of customers' funds and securities by broker-dealers or their salesmen,
frauds involving the sale of securities by new as well as established
businesses, and fraudulent securities sales in connection with the
promotion of insurance companies, mortgage companies, oil and gas
and other mining ventures, and other types of enterprises. It is not

provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 by offering and selling unregistered stock of Automatic Washer Company (United States v.
Abrams, et al.).
In late 1955,defendants Abrams and Albert gained control of Automatic Washer Company by causing a corporation which they controlled to purchase 330,000 shares of Automatic Washer stock at a
price considerably below the market price. Thereafter, they caused
Automatic 'Yasher Company to issue large blocks of stock to themselves and companies which they controlled in exchange for assets of
little value. In this manner defendants obtained a total of 1,585,000
shares out of a total issued and outstanding of 2,155,594. At the trial
it was proved that over 950,000of the shares acquired by the defendants were sold to the public, commencing in January 1956, and continuing through October 1956. In addition, during the period Abrams
and Albert distributed their Automatic stock on the Midwest Stock
Exchange, the price rose from $3 in December 1955, the date they
obtained control, to $9 in March 1956.
These convictions were obtained in spite of the fact that the defendants attempted to conceal their unlawful sales by utilizing many of
the devices that have been frequently employed to avoid the full disclosure requirements of the registration provisions of the Securities
Act. For example, the defendants distributed a large number of
shares to the public by permitting banks and brokerage houses to sell
out Automatic 'Yasher shares pledged by the defendants as collateral
for loans which they had no intention of repaying. The defendants
also attempted to disguise the distribution of their control stock by
initially making purported "private sales" to various friends and
relatives who acted as nominees or conduits. Although the shares so
sold were immediately resold to the public, the defendants claimed that
since they had made private placements to these "investors" they were
not engaging in a public distribution of the stock. Finally, defendant
Abrams also attempted to rely on a so-called "change of circumstances"
as justification for the resale of the stock he had purchased from
Automatic Washer Company.
The conviction of the defendants is significant in demonstrating
that unscrupulous promoters cannot evade the registration requirements of the Securities Act by spurious reliance on exemptions from
those requirements, and thereby deprive the investing public of full
disclosure concerning the affairs of the issuer and its management.
The convictions of Roy B. Kelly, Cecil V. Hagen, Milton J. Shuck
and Gulf Coast Leaseholds, Inc., in United States v. Van Allen, et al.,
are also significant. These defendants, nine other individuals, and
eight corporations were charged with violating and conspiring to

134

violate the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933 and the mail and wire fraud provisions of Title 18 of the U.S.
Code in connection with the offer and sale to the public of Gulf Coast
Leaseholds, Inc., stock.
Evidence adduced during the trial showed that Gulf Coast Leaseholds, Inc., was a small and unprofitable oil company controlled by
Hagen and Kelly. InSeptember 1954, after unsuccessfully attempting
to obtain an underwriter for a Gulf Coast Leaseholds stock offering,
Hagen and Kelly were introduced to John Van Allen. Although Van
Allen's Lichtenstein investment company, Brandel Trust, had only
$20.80 in its bank account, he agreed to have it purchase 750,000 shares
of Gulf Coast Leaseholds stock for approximately $1,300,000.
Using Brandel Trust as a conduit, Van Allen began distributing
Gulf Coast Leaseholds stock to the American public even before the
deal was closed, using the proceeds from these sales to take delivery of
each successive block of stock from Hagen and Kelly. Facilitated by
the dissemination of false and misleading information furnished by
Hagen and Kelly, the distribution of the 750,000 shares to the public
was completed by September 1955, at prices ranging up to $15 a share.
When the deal was closed the previous year the stock had been selling at
between $1.25 and $1.50 per share.
Subsequently, Kelly and Hagen caused $2 million of Gulf Coast
Leaseholds debentures to be issued to Van Allen. However, these
debentures which were convertible into common stock at the rate of $8
a share could not be resold until after November 17,1956, because they
were purportedly purchased for investment and bore a restrictive
legend. Accordingly, the defendants, in order to maintain the market
above the conversion price until that time, were forced to purchase
Gulf Coast Leaseholds stock on the open market. This stock was
resold to investors through two boiler-rooms owned by the defendant
Shuck. The experienced salesmen employed by Shuck utilized every
high-pressure device to induce unwary investors not only to purchase
this stock, but to hold it, thereby reducing the floating supply of stock
on the market.
Eight of the defendants pleaded guilty before or during the trial
and others were severed for trial. The trial, which began in November
1962, and continued until August 8, 1963, produced a transcript containing nearly 18,000 pages of testimony and over 1,000 exhibits. On
October 8, 1963, the court sentenced the defendants to imprisonment
totaling 7% years and $130,000in fines.
In addition to the 93 convictions obtained during the fiscal year,
30 convictions were affirmed by appellate courts in 12 cases. A number of the opinions affirming these convictions are extremely significant

to the Commission's enforcement program. Early in the fiscal year the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in United States v. Ross,2S
affirmed the convictions of Howard Ross and Paul Gordon, salesmen
for Kimball Securities, a "boiler-room" operation. The court rejected
the contention of one of the salesmen who made misrepresentations to
a customer, that he was warranted in relying on the information
about the issuer given to him by his employer. It noted that even the
few days during which the salesman had been employed prior to his
misrepresentations were enough to "teach anyone ... exactly what
was going on," and that the literature regarding the issuer prepared
by his employer "was suspicious on its face to anyone with the slightest
financial knowledge."
Shortly after the affirmance in United States v. Ross, the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in Farrell v. United States." affirmed
the convictions of David and Oliver Farrell for violations of the securities fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy statutes in connection with the
sale of discounted trust deeds and mortgages issued by Los Angeles
Trust Deed & Mortgage Exchange. The affirmance culminated one
of the Commission's most intensive investigations and prosecutions involving fraudulent mortgage and trust deed promotions. Among
other things, the court ruled that whether various instruments or investment programs were securities under the Securities Act was to be
determined under Federal law and on the basis of what the defendants
represented them to be.
During the fiscal year the final chapter in the prosecution involving
the longest trial in the history of Federal criminal law was closed.
The convictions of Virgil D. Dardi, Robert B. Gravis, Charles Rosenthal and Charles Berman were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit, in United Stateev, Da1'di.27 The Court rejected the
contention, that the length of the trial (11 months) was prejudicial,
stating that: "A multi-defendant stock fraud case, as involved as this
one, usually necessitates the delving into many financial transactions.
Those who participate in such transactions do not supply the government with a simple and clear picture. The picture, even as a jig-saw
puzzle, only comes into vision by the assembling of hundreds of
curiously shaped parts, each piece seemingly having' no identity until
it is fitted into and made a part of the whole."
Finally, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit also afflrmed
the convictions of Martin Benjamin, an attorney, Bernard Howard,
an accountant, and Milton Z. Mende in United States v. Ben}amin.2S

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The court noted: "This appeal concerns another of those sickening
financial frauds which so sadly memorialize the rapacity of the perpetrators and the gullibility, and perhaps also the cupidity, of the
victims. It is unusual in that the vehicle, American Equities Corporation, owned nothing at all-and, in a happier sense, in that the SEC
was able to nip the £raud quite early in the bud." With respect to
Benjamin and Howard, the court emphasized that "in our complex
society the accountant's certificate and the lawyer's opinion can be
instruments for inflicting pecuniary loss more potent than a chisel or
the crow-bar ... Congress equally could not have intended that men
holding themselves out as members of these ancient professions should
be able to escape criminal liability on a plea of ignorance when they
had shut their eyes to 'what was plainly to be seen or represented a
knowledge they knew they did not possess."
OFFICE OF PROGRAM PLANNING

The Office of Program Planning was established during the fiscal
year. A primary responsibility of the Office during its first year was
to assist and advise the Commission in the implementation of the
recommendations of the Special Study of Securities Markets. To this
end the Office participated, in coordination with other Commission
Offices and Divisions, in the legislative effort which culminated in the
Securities Acts Amendments of 1964, in the drafting and evaluation of
various rules which were proposed and/or adopted by the Commission,
and in counseling with the self-regulating agencies on rules adopted
by the latter. In the latter area, the Officedevoted particular attention
to the standards applicable to selling practices, market literature and
written investment advice. It began an analysis of the over-thecounter market for listed securities with a view toward measuring the
impact and effect of trading in listed securities off the national securities exchanges. Toward the end of the fiscal year the Office began
preparations for studies to examine problems involved in securities
distributions, and analysis of broker-dealer economics.
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically authorizes investigations to determine whether violations of the Federal
securities laws have occurred.
The nine regional offices of the Commission, with the assistance of
their respective branch offices,are chiefly responsible for the conduct
of investigations. In addition, the Office of Enforcement of the Division of Trading and Markets of the Commission's headquarters office
conducts investigations dealing with matters of particular interest or

THIRTIETH

AJ.'mUAL REPORT

137

urgency, either independently or assisting the regional offices. The
Office of Enforcement also exercises general supervision over and
coordination of the investigative activities of the regional offices. Its
staff examines and analyzes the investigative findings and recommendations of the regional offices and recommends appropriate action to
the Commission.
There are available to the Commission several sources of information
concerning possible violations of the provisions of the Feredal securities laws. The primary source of information is complaints by members of the general public concerning the activities of certain persons
in securities transactions. The Division of Trading and Markets and
the regional officesgive careful consideration to this information and,
if it appears that violations of the Federal securities laws may have
occurred, an investigation is commenced. Other sources of information which are of assistance to the Commission in carrying out its
enforcement responsibilities are the national securities exchanges, brokerage firms, state and Canadian securities authorities, better business
bureaus, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and
various law enforcement agencies.
It is the Commission's general policy to conduct its investigations
on a confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary to effective law
enforcement and to protect persons against whom unfounded or unconfirmed charges might be made. The Commission investigates many
complaints where no violation is ultimately found to have occurred.
To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in
hardship or embarrassment to many interested persons and might
affect the market for the securities in question, resulting in injury to
investors with no countervailing public benefits. Moreover, members
of the public would have a tendency to be reluctant to furnish information concerning violations if they thought their personal affairs would
be made public. Another advantage of confidential investigations is
that persons under suspicion of having violated the law are not made
aware that their activities are under surveillance, since such awareness
might have the effect of frustrating or obstructing the investigation.
Accordingly, the Commission does not generally divulge the result of a
nonpublic investigation unless it is made a matter of public record in
proceedings brought before the Commission or in the courts.
When it appears that a serious violation of the Federal securities
laws has occurred or is occurring, a "case" is opened and a full investigation is conducted. Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission to issue a formal order of investigation which
appoints members of its staff as officers to issue subpoenas, to take
testimony under oath and to require the production of documents.

138

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Usually this step is taken when the subjects of the investigation and
others who may be involved are uncooperative and it becomes necessary to use the subpoena power to complete the investigation of the
case.
During the past year 142 formal orders were issued in connection
with investigations handled through the Division of Trading and
Markets. In addition, there were 14 formal orders issued upon the
recommendation of the Division of Corporate Regulation and 12
upon the recommendation of the Division of Corporation Finance.
The latter Division conducts certain investigative work in connection
with the processing of filings under the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
When an investigation has been completed and enforcement action
appears appropriate, the Commission may proceed in one of several
ways. It may refer the case to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The Commission may also, when appropriate, institute civil proceedings for injunctive relief to halt further violations
of law. In that event a complaint is filed in the appropriate U.S.
district court and the case is presented by a member of the Commission's staff. Finally, if the case is one where the Commission has the
power to institute administrative proceedings, that avenue may be
chosen as the most appropriate under the circumstances.

activities of the Commission during fiscal 1964:

RESPECT TO FOREIGN SECURITIES

The unlawful offer and sale of Canadian securities in the United
States remained at a very low level in fiscal 1964. For the most part,
the cooperation of Canadian officials and segments of the Canadian
securities industry with the Commission has been very good.
The recent trend toward an increase in fraudulent promotions from
the Bahamas and Panama continued during fiscal 1964. In dealing
with these problems, the Commission is experiencing considerable
success with the new and simplified procedures for obtaining foreign
postal fraud orders. The success of this program is due in large measure to the continuing cooperation of the Post Office Department.

The Commission is still hampered by jurisdictional problems, including the status of the Supplementary Extradition Convention with
Canada,"
The Commission continues to maintain its Canadian Restricted
List, which consists of Canadian companies whose securities the
Commission has reason to believe are being, or recently have been,
distributed in the United States inviolation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The list and supplements thereto
are issued to and published by the press, and copies are mailed to all
registered broker-dealers and are available to the public. As a practical matter, most United States broker-dealers refuse to execute
transactions in such securities.
Five supplements and a revised cumulative list were issued in fiscal
1964. Reflecting the more effective enforcement activities here and
in Canada, it was necessary to add only two names to the list during the
year, compared with seven names added in fiscal 1963, 9 in fiscal 1962,
47 in fiscal 1961, and 82 in fiscal 1960. A total of 117 names was deleted during the year, following compliance with established procedures. The number of names on the list as of June 30, 1964, was

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

As a part of its enforcement program, the Commission maintains a
Section of Securities Violations whose purpose is to aid the detection
and prevention of fraud in securities transactions. The Section maintains files which provide a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies for information concerning persons who have been charged with
or found in violation of various Federal and state securities statutes.
The information contained in these files is kept current through the
cooperation of various governmental and nongovernmental agencies,
including the U.S. Post Office Department, The Federal Bureau of
Investigation, parole and probation officials, state securities authorities, Federal and state prosecuting attorneys, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), better business bureaus and
chambers of commerce. At the end of the fiscal year the files contained information concerning 71,740 persons or firms against whom
Federal or state action had been taken in connection with securities
violations. During the year items of information concerning 8,599
persons or firms were added, including information as to 3,062 persons
or firms not previously identified in these records. A total of 9,538
names was deleted, since the information concerning them was believed
to be obsolete.
The Section issues and distributes to officials of cooperating law
enforcement and other agencies in the United States and Canada a
quarterly securities violations bulletin containing information received
during the period concerning alleged and actual violators and showing
new charges and developments in pending cases. The bulletin includes
a "wanted" section listing the names of persons wanted on securities
violations charges, and references to bulletins containing descriptive
information regarding them. It also includes a section reporting
NASD disciplinary actions which resulted in the expulsion or suspension of an association member, or in the revocation or suspension
of the registration of a representative of a member. This section of
the bulletin identifies the ..disciplined member or representative and
briefly describes the NASD's findings,
Extensive use is made of the information available in the files of
the Section of Securities Violations by regulatory and law enforcement officials. Each year numerous requests are received for special
reports on individuals, in addition to the information supplied by the
quarterly bulletin. During the fiscal year the Commission received
and disposed of 3,174 "securities violations" letters or reports and dispatched 733 communications to cooperating agencies. .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE CO:MMISSION

APPLICATIONS FOR NONDISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various Acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933,
disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value of
the contract and is not necessary for the protection of investors. Under
Section 24 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade secrets
or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with the Commission. Under Section 24(b) of that Act, written objection to public
disclosure of information contained in any material filed with the
Commission may be made to the Commission which is then authorized
to make public disclosure of such information only if in its judgment
such disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained in Section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and in Section 45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These
statutory provisions have been implemented by rules specifying the
procedure to be followed by applicants for a determination that public
disclosure is not necessary in a particular case.
The number of applications pending and the action taken on them
during the year are set forth in the following table:

ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The several Acts administered by the Commission recognize the
importance of dependable informative financial statements which
disclose the financial status and earnings history of a corporation or
other commercial entity. These statements, whether filed in compliance with the requirements under those' statutes or included in other
material available to stockholders or prospective investors, are indispensable to investors as a basis for investment decisions. The Congress, cognizant of the fact that such statements lend themselves

TEaRTIETH ~AL

REPORT

143

readily to misleading inferences or even deception, whether or not
intended, included express provisions in the various Acts with respect
to financial information required to be disclosed. Thus, for example,
the Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus of balance
sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the Commission
shall prescribe" 30 and authorizes the Commission to prescribe the
"items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts ... " 31 Similar authority is contained in the Securities
Exchange Act,32 and even more comprehensive power is embodied
in the Investment Company Act 33 and the Public Utility Holding
Company Act.34
Pursuant to the broad rulemaking power thus conferred with respect
to the preparation and presentation of financial statements, the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies
subject to the Holding Company Act ;35has adopted rules under the
Securities Exchange Act governing accounting for and auditing of
securities brokers and dealers; 36and has promulgated rules contained
in a single comprehensive regulation, identified as Regulation S-X,31
which governs the form and content of financial statements filed in
compliance with the several Acts. This regulation is supplemented by
the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of which 99 have so far
been issued." These releases were inaugurated in 1931 and were
designed as a program for making public from time to time opinions
on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the
uniform systems of accounts which are regulatory reports, prescribe
accounting principles to be followed only in certain limited areas. In
the large area of financial reporting not covered by such rules, the

ment is by requiring a certificate of an independent public accountant,
based on an audit performed in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards, which expresses an opinion as to whether the
financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with accounting principles and practices which are recognized as sound and which
have attained general acceptance.
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 39 The other three statutes permit the Commission to require
that such statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent
public accountant," and the Commission's rules require, with minor
exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by
qualified accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by
some individual accountants, was for the first time authoritatively
and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. Under the Commission's
rules, an accountant who is qualified to practice in his own state is
qualified to practice before the Commission unless he has entered into
disqualifying relationships with a particular client, such as becoming
a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, employee, or
stockholder; 41 has demonstrated incompetence or subservience to
management; or has engaged in unethical or improper professional
conduct."
The Commission endeavors to encourage and foster the independence
of the accountant in his relationships with his client so that he may
better be able to perform the service to the public contemplated by
the Congress in the various Acts administered by the Commission.
Because of his special status and responsibility, the accountant has a
unique opportunity to be a leader in raising standards of investor
protection. The financial statements provide the key information
both in the distribution and trading of securities. The work of the
accountant in their preparation and publication is vital. Independent accountants lend authority to management's representations by
their opinions as experts, and they operate as a check on management
in assuring that the financial data are fairly presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Commission is vigilant in its efforts to assure itself that the
audits which it requires are performed by independent accountants;

addition, it recognizes that changes and new developments in financial
and economic conditions affect the operations and financial status of the
several thousand commercial and industrial companies required to file
statements with the Commission and that accounting and auditing
procedures cannot remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic
economy. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore, studies the
changes and new developments for the purpose of establishing and
maintaining appropriate accounting and auditing policies, procedures
and practices for the protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission, who has general supervision with respect to accounting and
auditing policies and their application.
Progress in these activities requires continuing contact and consultation between the staff and accountants both individually and through
such representative groups as, among others, the American Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Financial Analysts
Federation, the Financial Executives Institute, and the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, as well as many
Government agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation in
the formulation of accounting principles and practices, adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will best serve the interests of
investors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
Financial Analysts Federation and the Financial Executives Institute appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's
staff.
The Commission on its part has authorized its Chief Accountant to
continue to serve as a member of an advisory committee to the Accounting Principle Board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. This committee has been serving as adviser to the Institute's Director of Research who has been engaged in making an inventory of accounting principles and practices recognized by the
accounting profession and currently in use. The work on this inventory is nearing completion and will be published soon by the Institute.
The Chief Accountant has also served on a somewhat similar committee of the American Accounting Association.
The many daily decisions to be made which require the attention of
members of the Chief Accountant's staff include questions raised by
the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices, and
757-903-<65--11

146

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the Commission itself. As a result of this day-to-day activity and the
need to keep abreast of current accounting problems, the Chief Accountant's staff continually reexamines accounting and auditing principles and practices. From time to time members of the staff are
called upon to assist in field investigations, to participate in hearings
and to review Commission opinions insofar as they pertain to accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences with officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others are also an important part of the work
of the staff. Resolution of questions and problems in this manner
saves registrants and their representatives both time and expense.
The 1964 amendments to the securities acts will bring into contact with
the Commission many heretofore "unregulated" companies. Undoubtedly, in many cases, the accountant will be a primary bridge
between the issuer and the Commission. The accountant will be called
on to advise on the establishment of systems and controls which will
promote the most effective and comprehensible form of compliance.
A little foresight can avoid many unnecessary, and possibly embarrassing, problems. For example, when it is contemplated that a company
will have to register in the future-as
when the shareholder limit
under the 1964 amendments drops to 500 after about 2 years-the
appropriate internal controls should be established now to avoid potential problems which might preclude the issuance of an unqualified
certificate.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems are found in the
examination of financial statements required to be filed with the Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations
of the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable
generally accepted accounting principles have not been adhered to,
the examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence
or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff.
Where particularly difficult or novel questions arise which cannot be
settled by the accounting staff of the divisions and by the Chief
Accountant, they are referred to the Commission for consideration
and decision.
Difficulties often arise in connection with initial filings because
accountants and other advisers who serve the registrant have not had
any prior experience with the Commission. In some cases these persons have not familiarized themselves with the rules and regulations
of the Commission-particularly
the instructions as to financial state-

THIRTIETH

ments required by the forms, the rules relating to independence of the
certifying accountant, and those relating to the form and content of
financial statements as set forth in Regulation S-X. In an effort to
improve this situation several members of the accounting staff of the
Commission participated in a course on filings with the Commission,
at the invitation of the sponsor, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants. This course, first offered in 1963, has been given
in Chicago, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. In addition the Chief Accountant and
other members of the staff have addressed accounting groups in many
cities on the financial reporting requirements of the securities acts.
This work is continuing and it is believed should facilitate the adjustment of companies becoming subject to those acts for the first time as
a result of the 1964 amendments of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.
During the year the Office of the Chief Accountant devoted considerable time to the various aspects of the 1964 amendments, and in
response to a specific request of the Sub-committee on Commerce and
Finance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House
of Representatives, prepared a memorandum on H.R. 6789 and H.R.
6793 which was included in the record on those bills. This memorandum set forth what the Commission understands to be some of
the areas of accounting where alternative practices could produce
materially different results under generally accepted accounting principles and included a statement as to the Commission's policy with
respect to financial reporting.
The staff of the Chief Accountant's Office and the staff of the Office
of Program Planning had several conferences during fiscal 1964 with
representatives of the New York Stock Exchange for the purpose of
securing information necessary for a better understanding of the
Stock Exchange's commission rate structure and leveL As recommended by the Special Study," the Income and Expense Report developed by the Exchange was reviewed to determine whether that
report could be revised to be more useful as a basis for studies by this
Commission and the Exchange.
Representatives from the Chief Accountant's Office, the New York
Stock Exchange, and its consultants Price Waterhouse & Co., and the
two odd-lot member firms conferred and made field investigations
for the purpose of determining how the recommendation of the Special Study to the effect that "The New York Stock Exchange should
recognize and meet its responsibility to regulate odd-lot differentials"

should be implemented.v
These persons studied the operating methods and financial data of odd-lot dealers for the purpose of developing
a financial report which will reflect the income and expenses of the
odd-lot functions of brokers and dealers in this area of the securities
market.
Conferences were held between members of the Commission's staff
from the Division of Trading and Markets, certain regional offices,
and the Office of the Chief Accountant and representatives of the New
York and Midwest Stock Exchanges, and representatives of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to consider a proposed
revision of Form X-17A-5, the annual report of financial condition
required to be filed by certain brokers and dealers pursuant to Section
17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is being revised
to meet changing conditions and practices in the securities industry
and expanded and clarified for its use by small brokers and dealers
not fully familiar with stock exchange practices.
Cooperation between the Office of the Chief Accountant and the
Division of Corporate Regulation resulted in a proposed new rule
and a proposed revision of annual report Form N-30A-1 under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.45 The proposed new rule, Rule
2a-4, defines procedures to be followed in the periodic calculation of
the net asset value of any redeemable security issued by a registered
investment company for the purposes of distribution, redemption,
and repurchase of such redeemable security. The proposed revision
of annual report Form N-30A-l which is filed with the Commission
by registered management investment companies will require an accountant, in addition to certifying the financial statements in such
reports, to assume varying degrees of responsibility as to the fair
presentation of information presented in many other items, e.g., asset
coverage of senior securities, portfolio turnover rates, and with respect to items in the minutes relating to financial matters.
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEWPMENT

Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended, exempts from registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, securities issued, or guaranteed as
to both principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

has, pursuant to the above authority, adopted rules requiring the Bank
to .file quarterly reports and also to .file copies of each annual report
of the Bank to its Board of Governors. The Bank is also required to
file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in the
United States of its primary obligations.
The Commission, acting
in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued or guaranteed by the
Bank during the period of such suspension.
During the Bank's last .fiscal year ending June 30, 1964, the Bank
made 37 loans totaling $809.9 million, compared with a total of $448.7
million last year. The loans were made in Algeria, Chile (two loans) ,

loans), Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan (three loans), Peru (two loans),
Portugal (two loans) , Spain, Thailand, Tunisia, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. This brought the total number of loans to 386 in 73 countries
and territories and raised the gross total of commitments to $7,931.3
million. By June 30, as a result of cancellations, exchange adjustments, repayments and sales of loans, the portion of loans signed still
retained by the Bank had been reduced to $5,191.9 million.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $173.3 million principal amounts of loans, compared with sales of $273.3 million last year.
On June 30, the total of such sales was $1,778.6 million, of which all
except $69 million had been made without the Bank's guarantee.
On June 30, the outstanding funded debt of the Bank was $2,491.8

During the year, the funded debt was increased by $104.5 million
through the private placement of a $100 million United States dollar
bond issue and the delivery of $4.5 million of bonds which had been
subject to delayed delivery arrangements.
The debt was decreased by
$131.9 million as a result of the maturing of the equivalent of $107.8
million of bonds and of sinking fund and purchase fund transactions
amounting to $24.1 million.
During the fiscal year the following 17 countries became members of
the Bank: Algeria, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic,
Chad, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Leopoldville), Dahomey, Gabon,
Guinea, Kenya, Malagasy Republic, Mali, Mauritania, Rwanda, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uganda.

INTER-AMERICAN

DEVELOPMENT

BANK

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the new Inter-American Development Bank, provides an exemption for certain securities which may be
issued by the Bank similar to that provided for securities of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission adopted Regulation lA, which
requires the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same
information, documents and reports as are required from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is
also required to file a report with the Commission prior to the sale of
any of its primary obligations to the public in the United. States.
During the year ended June 30, 1964,the Bank made 22 loans totaling the equivalent of $119,977,000from its ordinary capital resources,
bringing the gross total of loan commitments outstanding at June 30,
to 89, aggregating $413,509,123. During the year, the Bank sold or
agreed to sell $6,273,524in participations in the aforesaid loans, all of
such participations being without the guarantee of the Bank. The

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

During the past fiscal year the Officeof Statistical Studies (formerly
Branch of Economic Research) continued its regular work in connection with the statistical activities of the Commission and the overall
Government statistical program under the direction of the Office of
Statistical Standards, Bureau of the Budget.
The statistical series described below are published in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin and in addition, except for data on registered
issues, and on corporate pension funds, current figures and analyses
of the data are published in quarterly press releases.
Issues registered

under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of security, and
use of proceeds. Summary statistics for the years 1935-64 are given
in Appendix Table 1 and detailed statistics for the fiscal year 1964
appear in Appendix Table 2.
New Securities Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered
for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers. Annual
statistics on new offerings for recent years as well as monthly figures
from January 1963, through June 1964, are given in Appendix Tables
-3,4,and 5.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale of
securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations to
investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and
net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations
and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals'

Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of saving and
the form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in securities,
expansion of bank deposits, increases in insurance and pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the

152

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived in
connection with its national income series, is published annually by
the Department of Commerce as well as in the Securities and Exchange
Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Private Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of private pension plans other than those
administered by insurance companies, showing the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested and the
principal items of income and expenditures. A new quarterly survey
has been initiated in cooperation with certain large bank trustees and
corporations to obtain quarterly figures on pension fund assets and
stock transactions, and similar figures are being collected from property and casualty insurance companies. This information is to be
combined with statistics on investments of other financial intermediaries, and it is planned that the data will be published in the current
fiscal year.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on the working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and loan
associations, shows the principal components of current assets and
liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources
and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all United States manufacturing
concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and size of
company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant and
equipment expenditures of all United States business, exclusive of
agriculture. After the close of each quarter, data are released on actual
capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for
the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the beginning
of each year of the plans for business expansion during that year.
Directory of Registered Companies

The Commission annually publishes a listing of companies required
to file annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
addition to an alphabetical listing, there is a listing of companies by
industry group classified according to The Standard Industrial Classification Manual.

Stock Market Data

The Office of Statistical Studies regularly compiles statistics on
the market value and volume of sales on registered and exempted
securities exchanges, round-lot stock transactions on the New York
exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock
transactions on the New York exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions.
Data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the two
New York exchanges are released weekly. The other statistical data
mentioned above, as well as these weekly series, are published regularly
in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Administrative proceedings under the statutes administered by the
Commission and under its Rules of Practice generally involve a hearing before a hearing examiner and culminate in the issuance of an
opinion by the Commission. Under a modified procedure adopted
during the :fiscal year and applicable to proceedings initiated on or
after August 1, 1964, the Commission will adopt the hearing examiner's
decision if Commission review is not sought or if the Commission does
not deem it appropriate to review that decision.
In the preparation of its opinions, the Commission, or the individual
Commissioner to whom a case may be assigned for the preparation
of an opinion, is generally assisted by the Office of Opinions and
Review (fonnerly Office of Opinion Writing).
This Office is directly
responsible to the Commission and is completely independent of the
operating divisions, consistent with the principle of separation of
functions embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act. Where the
parties to a proceeding waive their right to such separation, the operating division of the Commission which participated in the proceeding
may assist in the drafting of the Commission's decision.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and are distributed
to the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, they are printed and published periodically by the Government
Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange
Commission Decisions and Reports."
DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

As indicated elsewhere herein, a wealth of :financial and other information is contained in the registration statements and reports :filed
with the Commission, which are public documents available for inspection by investors and other interested persons. Much of this information finds its way into securities manuals and other :financial publications. Various activities of the Commission serve to augment the public

154

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

dissemination of financial and other information filed with the Commission and that reflected in decisions issued by and other actions of
the Commission.
To facilitate the public dissemination of this information, the Commission publishes a daily "News Digest" containing a resume of each
proposal for the public offering of securities for which a registration
statement is filed, as well as a summary of each order, decision or rule
issued or other action taken by the Commission. Thus, during the year,
the Digest included a. report on each of the 1,039 registration statements filed with the Commission (not including investment company
filings which added additional securities by way of amendments toprevious filings) ; and it also included summaries of the 8$9 orders,
decisions, rules and other actions of the Commission. It also summarized 300 releases announcing injunctive and other enforcement
actions of the Commission. The Digest is made immediately available
to the press; and it also is reprinted and distributed by the Government Printing Office, on a subscription basis, to some 2,565 investors,
securities firms, practicing lawyers and others. The Commission also
makes a more limited distribution of the full text of its decisions and
other actions.
Through public discussions by individual members of the Commission and staff officers, including addresses before professional, business
and other groups and participation in panel discussions, the Commission also seeks to promote a better understanding of the provisions
of the laws it administers and the rules promulgated thereunder, thus
facilitating compliance therewith.
Information Available for Public Inspection

The many thousands of registration statements, applications, declarations, and annual and other periodic reports filed each year are
available for public inspection at the Commission's principal officein
Washington, D.C. In addition, copies of recent reports filed by companies having securities listed on exchanges other than the New York
Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, and copies of
current reports of many nonlisted companies which have registered
securities for public offering under the Securities Act, may be examined in the Commission's New York Regional Office; and recent
reports filed by companies whose securities are listed on the New York
and American Stock Exchanges may be examined in the Commission's
Chicago Regional Office. Moreover, there are available for examination in all regional offices copies of prospectuses relating to recent
public offerings of securities registered under the Securities Act; and
all regional officeshave copies of broker-dealer annual financial reports

THIRTIETH

ANNUAL REPORT

155

and Regulation A letters of notification filed in their respective
regions. Reports of companies whose securities are listed on the
various exchanges may be seen at the respective exchange offices.
In order to facilitate a wider dissemination of financial and other
information contained in corporate reports filed with the Commission
under the Federal securities laws (an objective strongly urged by the
Special Study Report), the Commission has arranged to take standing orders, on an experimental basis, for photocopies of Form 1D-K
annual reports filed. This service may be extended later to other
reports, depending upon public reception and the experience gained
in supplying copies of annual reports.
Under the existing contract with a printing company for the reproduction of material in the Commission's public files in response to
requests of members of the public, photocopies may be obtained at a
reduced cost of 0.08 cent per page for pages not exceeding 81;2" by 14"
in size. The detailed per-page prices are given in Release No. 34-7351
which may be obtained from the publications unit of the Commission.
The charge for each certification of any document by the Commission
is $2.
So that corporate reports may be more readily available for examination by interested members of the public, the Commission also has
made arrangements for the Form 10-K annual reports to be placed on
open shelves in the public area of its public reference room in Washington, D.C., thus making these reports available for immediate inspection. There are presently three coin-operated photocopiers in the
public reference room to enable visitors to make immediate reproductions of reports at a cost of 25 cents per page. (The New York
Regional Officehas a similar machine.)
Each year many thousands of requests for photocopies of and information from the public files of the Commission are received by the
public reference room in Washington, D.C. During the year 5,132
persons examined material on file in the Washington, D.C. officeand
several thousand others examined files in the New York and Chicago
regional offices. Over 18,268 searches were made for individuals requesting information and approximately 2,164 letters were written
with respect to information required.
PUBLICATIONS

In addition to the daily News Digest, and releases concerning Commission action under the Acts administered by it and concerning litigation involving securities violations, the Commission issues a number
of other publications, including the following:

During the fiscal year, certain organizational changes were effected
pursuant to recommendations of the Special Study of Securities
Markets.
In July 1963, a new Office of Program Planning was established
to assist the Commission in reviewing and formulating policy and of
coordinating activities in the implementation of the Special Study's
recommendations.
This work involves, in coordination with other
Commission offices and divisions, changes in the rules, regulations and
policies of the Commission and self-regulatory agencies; recommendations for legislation; proposals for modifications of industry practices;
and procedures for gathering and analyzing economic data about the
securities markets.

realigned to implement the recommendation contained in the Report
of the Special Study that the Division be so organized and staffed
that it might more adequately oversee the operation of the self-regulatory agencies, examine on a continuous basis changing market circumstances and regulatory needs and appraise the adequacies of existing
regulatory measures. In addition, the Report recommended that the
Division's research activities be expanded so that greater emphasis
be given to the compilation, analysis and, where appropriate, publication of data concerning certain aspects and developments in the trading markets. As reconstituted, the Division consists of six unitsthe Offices of Chief Counsel, Criminal Reference, Enforcement, Regulation, Special Proceedings, and Statistical Studies.
Another change effected during the year involved the transfer of
the Section of Machine Tabulation from the Office of the Comptroller
to the Office of Records and Service. This change was made in contemplation of the installation of a computer during fiscal year 1965,
which is to be operated by the staff of that Section.
PERSONNEL AND FINANCIAL

MANAGEMENT

Highlights of the Commission's personnel program in fiscal 1964
included (1) increased activities designed to curb grade escalation, (2)
the addition of an important fringe benefit in the form of accident
insurance, (3) the conduct of OPERATION SCAN under the incentive awards program, (4) participation in the Federal government's
program for hiring mentally retarded persons and (5) the continuation of after-hours training of employees.
In the 6 years from 1958 to 1963, the average grade in the Commission rose from 8.8 to 9.1. This is a 3.4 percent increase as compared
with a 12.5 percent increase for all agencies. Similarly, the number
of positions in grades GS-13 through GS-18 increased only 10 percent
as compared with an increase of 59 percent for all agencies. Although
no significant or unwarranted rise in the grades of its positions was
found, the Commission instituted measures to control upgradings
which could not be fully justified. As of June 30, 1964, the average
grade was 9.2.
All employees were offered complete accident insurance coverage at
group rates under the Securities Commission Accident Plan (SCAP)
adopted in June 1964. This plan is offered as an employee service at
00 cost to the Commission. Employees pay the total cost of premiums
and deal directly with the insurance company or its agent on a private
transaction basis. The plan is particularly attractive to employees
who perform considerable officialtravel.

OPERATION SCAN was launched in April 1964 in an all-out
effort to spur all Commission employees to propose and devise new
ways to improve job performance and to suggest ways to improve
methods, reduce costs, increase productivity, and save man-hours.
Members of the Commission sent a letter to each employee urging
wholehearted participation in the program.
Chairman John W.
Macy, Jr., of the Civil Service Commission in a letter to the Chairman
stated:
My congratulations to you and your associates for this imaginative
response to the President's call for an intensified effort aimed at encouraging employee ideas for cutting costs and increasing efficiency during
this Tenth Anniversary year of the incentive awards program. We plan
to bring this program to the attention of other agencies .....

The Commission was one of the first Federal agencies to employ a
qualified mentally retarded person under the special appointing authority approved by the Civil Service Commission. The young man
entered on duty as a messenger on February 17, 1964 and he has performed satisfactorily.
Formalized training in the work of the Commission continued to be
emphasized by several of the divisions and offices. The Division of
Trading and Markets conducted its Third Annual Seminar on Investigative Techniques and Trial Practice in the spring of 1964. Eight
after-hour sessions were conducted. A highlight of the Seminar was
a mock administrative hearing held in the court room of the United
States Court of Military Appeals.
The Commission's General Counsel, Philip A. Loomis, Jr., received
a Career Service Award from the National Civil Service League in
April 1964. He is the third employee to be accorded this honor.
Andrew Barr, Chief Accountant of the Commission, received the 1964
Alpha Kappa Psi Foundation Award. Frederick Moss, Chief, Office
of Special Proceedings, Division of Trading and Markets, was a semifinalist for one of 10 Arthur S. Flemming Awards presented annually
to outstanding young men in the Federal Service.
During the period April 15, 1963 through June 30, 1964, 130 members of the staff received an additional within-grade salary increase
in recognition of high quality performance. These awards are authorized by Section 702 of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended by
the Salary Reform Act of 1962.
Cash awards totaling $5,700 and certificates of merit were presented
to 48 employees at the Commission's Eighth Annual Service and Merit
Awards Ceremony, held in October 1963.
