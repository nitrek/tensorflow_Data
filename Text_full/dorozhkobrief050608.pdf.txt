STATEMENT OF THE CASE

2


A.	 Nature of the case

2


B. Facts

3


	

1. 	Dorozhko opened an online trading account in early
October, 2007.

4

2. On the afternoon of October 17, 2007, a hacker obtained 

nonpublic information that the earnings of IMS, which were

scheduled to be released after the market closed that day, 

would be below analyst consensus estimates.

4


3. Barely a half hour after the hacker obtained the IMS earnings

information, Dorozhko spent approximately a year’s income

buying put options that would become worthless in two days

unless the price of IMS stock dropped substantially.

7


4. Following release of the earnings results, IMS stock fell 28%
and Dorozhko sold the put options for a net profit of over

$285,000 – an over 600% return in less than one day.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

12


ARGUMENT

14


I.	 Standards of review for preliminary injunctions against future 

violations and for prejudgment asset freezes.

15


i


TABLE OF CONTENTS (CONTINUED)

Page
A. Injunction against future violations.

16

B. Asset freeze.

16

II. Dorozhko employed a “deceptive device or contrivance” within
the meaning of Section 10(b) when he hacked into a secure
computer in order to obtain material nonpublic information.

18

A. Dorozhko’s hacking constituted the employment of a “deceptive
device or contrivance.”

19

1. “Any deceptive device or contrivance” is a broad-reaching
phrase that covers all schemes to mislead, or to cause to
believe the false, such as by trick, falsification, concealment,
or cheating.

19

2. Dorozhko’s conduct in hacking into a secure computer system to
obtain nonpublic information was a “deceptive device or
contrivance.”
22
B. Conduct similar to Dorozhko’s is deemed fraudulent or deceptive
under other antifraud statutes.
28
1. The two Cherif decisions find that unauthorized electronic
access for the purpose of obtaining confidential information
is a form of fraud under both Section 10(b) and the mail
fraud statute.

29

2. Gaining unauthorized access to a computer system for the
purpose of obtaining confidential information is a form of
fraud under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

32

ii

TABLE OF CONTENTS (CONTINUED)
Page
3. Hacking, including hacking to obtain access to confidential

information, is also a form of fraud under legal provision 

other than the CFAA.

34


C. Congress intended Section 10(b) to be applied to new types of

fraudulent schemes that threaten market integrity and investor

confidence.

36


III. A lie, trickery, or half-truth is “deceptive” whether or not the 

person making the misrepresentation is acting in breach of a 

fiduciary duty.

40


A. The language and legislative history of Section 10(b) establish 

that it reaches all deceptive devices and contrivances, with no

requirement of a breach of duty.

43 


B.	 The Supreme Court has explained that Section 10(b) follows the

common law rule that deception may be shown either by 

affirmative misrepresentations or by silence in breach of a duty 

of disclosure.
44

1. The distinction between fraud through affirmative

misrepresentation and fraud through breach of duty is 

most clearly illustrated in the Court’s insider trading cases.

44


2. The Supreme Court has recognized that fraud may be based
on either misrepresentations or failure to speak in violation

of a duty in non-insider trading cases as well.
C. 	This Court has recognized that fraud can violate Section 10(b)
even if there is no breach of fiduciary duty.



47



49


1.	 Pump-and-Dump Schemes.

50


2.	 Manipulation.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS (CONTINUED)

D. The district court’s error was in applying the special rules that
govern fraud-through-breach-of-duty-to-disclose, such as in
traditional insider trading cases, to a case where there was
active deception.

JURISDICTION
The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to Section 27 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78aa, over this civil law
enforcement action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Commission appeals from the district court’s order denying its motion
for a preliminary injunction and lifting an asset freeze that the court had
entered at the beginning of the litigation against defendant Oleksandr
Dorozhko. JA998-1051.1 This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
1292(a)(1). The district court entered its order on January 8, 2008. The
Commission’s notice of appeal was timely filed on January 11, 2008. Fed.
R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).

ISSUES P RESENTED FOR R EVIEW
1. Whether defendant employed a “deceptive device or contrivance”
within the meaning of the antifraud provisions in Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act when he hacked into a secure computer system in order to
obtain material nonpublic information about corporate earnings that he
immediately used to trade in securities.
1

“JA” refers to the Joint Appendix filed with this brief.
1

2. Whether the only conduct that can be “deceptive” under Section
10(b) is conduct that breaches a fiduciary duty.

S TATEMENT OF THE C ASE
A.

Nature of the case

The Commission alleges that defendant Oleksandr Dorozhko
committed securities fraud in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5, when
he hacked into a secure computer system to obtain material non-public
corporate information and immediately exploited that information to buy
securities. JA9-10, JA12-16. The Commission sought a preliminary
injunction and asset freeze pending the outcome of the litigation, and a
permanent injunction and other appropriate relief following final
adjudication of its claim. JA16-17, JA27-46.
The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(Judge Buchwald) issued a temporary restraining order and froze the
proceeds of the fraudulent transactions at the time the Commission’s
complaint was filed. JA18-26. After conducting a hearing on the
Commission’s request for a preliminary injunction, the district court ruled
2


that the Commission was unlikely to prevail on the merits of its claim
reasoning that “a breach of fiduciary duty of disclosure is a required
element of any ‘deceptive’ device under § 10(b)” (JA1017-1018) (emphasis
added), even in cases where the defendant affirmatively made deceptive
statements or engaged in deceptive conduct, and the Commission had not
presented evidence that Dorozhko had violated any such duty. JA1002.
The court therefore denied the Commission’s motion for preliminary
injunction and ordered the freeze to be lifted, but allowed the Commission
to seek a stay pending appeal in this Court. JA1049-1050. After the
Commission sought emergency relief here, this Court ordered that the
freeze be maintained pending its review of the district court’s decision.
JA1171.
B.

Facts

The following statement of facts is based on the evidence introduced at
the preliminary injunction hearing. Defendant has invoked a Fifth
Amendment right not to testify. JA406-407.

3


1. 	

Dorozhko opened an online trading account in early
October, 2007.

On or about October 4, 2007, Oleksandr Dorozhko, a self-employed
Ukrainian national residing in Uzhgorod, Ukraine (JA62, JA64-68), wire
transferred $42,500 to Interactive Brokers, LLC (a U.S. registered broker) to
open an online trading account. JA451, JA476-480. In his application to
open that account, Dorozhko represented that he had an annual net income
of approximately $45,000-$50,000 and claimed a net worth of between
$100,000-$250,000. JA451, JA468.
2.	

On the afternoon of October 17, 2007, a hacker obtained
nonpublic information that the earnings of IMS, which
were scheduled to be released after the market closed
that day, would be below analyst consensus estimates.

On October 17, 2007, IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS”), a public
company headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, prepared to announce
its third quarter earnings results at 5:00p.m. (after the close of the trading
markets) that day. JA586-587. Those earnings were well below analyst
consensus estimates, and there were no media/analyst reports at the time
anticipating negative earnings. JA573, JA587. For several years, Thomson
Financial has “hosted” IMS’s investor relations website and provided

4


secure webcasting and audiocasting services for IMS’s public release of
earnings information, including the October 17th announcement. JA482­
83, JA840-841. IMS and Thomson Financial took substantial steps to
maintain the confidentiality of the earnings information prior to its public
release. JA587-589, JA841-842.
As early as on October 9, several days prior to the October 17
announcement, IMS publicly disclosed that it would announce its third
quarter earnings on October 17th at 5:00p.m. (EST) on the IMS website at
Thomson Financial. JA851-852, JA939. Thomson Financial had elaborate
multi-layered procedures in place to block pre-release access to
information such as IMS’s third quarter results by anyone except
authorized IMS and Thomson Financial personnel. JA841-842, JA847-848.
Beginning at 8:06a.m. (EST) on October 17, a computer hacker from
Internet Protocol address (“IP address”) 83.98.156.219 began probing the
IMS website at Thomson Financial.2 JA845-846. Because Thomson
Financial had not yet received any IMS information, the hacker did not

2

An “IP address” is a number assigned to a computer. See JA853­

854.
5

obtain any confidential IMS information. JA846-847. Three times
thereafter, at 12:10p.m., at 12:51p.m., and at 1:52p.m., a computer user from
the same IP address probed to determine if Thomson Financial had
received the nonpublic IMS information, which it had not. JA845-847,
JA908.
At 2:01p.m. on October 17, IMS sent Thomson Financial slides with the
third quarter IMS earnings report for the 5:00p.m. conference call and
webcast. JA588. After receiving the slides, Thomson Financial
transformed them into a proprietary format and uploaded them to an
internal secure server. JA843-844. IMS and Thomson Financial expected,
and had established procedures to ensure, that the slides would remain
confidential until publicly released. JA586-88, JA841, JA843-844.
At 2:15.01 p.m., minutes after the slides had been uploaded, the
computer hacker from IP address 83.98.156.219 again probed the Thomson
Financial computer network and discovered that Thomson Financial had
the IMS information. JA847-848, JA908. Within 27 seconds, starting at
2:15:28 p.m., the hacker breached the Thomson Financial security system
and gained access to the confidential IMS information. Id. By 2:18.43 p.m.,

6


the hacker had viewed and/or downloaded all the IMS earnings
information. Id.
3.	

Barely a half hour after the hacker obtained the IMS
earnings information, Dorozhko spent approximately a
year’s income buying put options that would become
worthless in two days unless the price of IMS stock
dropped substantially.

Starting at 2:52p.m. on October 17, barely a half hour after the hacker
obtained the confidential IMS information, Dorozhko began using his
Interactive Brokers account for the first time in a very aggressive campaign
to purchase put options on IMS shares.3 JA453-463, JA476-553. By
3:06p.m. on October 17, Dorozhko had purchased 300 IMS October put
options with a strike price of $25.00 and 330 IMS October put options with
a strike price of $30.00. Id.
These options were extremely risky. The options expired only two days
after Dorozhko purchased them and would have been worthless unless

3

A put option is a contract that provides the buyer with the right, but
not the obligation, to sell a security by a date (the “expiration date”) for a
certain price (the “strike price”). The buyer of a put option generally
expects the market price of the underlying security will decline, allowing
the buyer of the option to make a profit from the difference between the
strike price (less the cost of the option) and the lower market price. JA571.
7

IMS stock took a dramatic fall. JA572. This was a substantial purchase for
Dorozhko; the investment of $41,670.90 was nearly all the money available
in his account, and was nearly equivalent to his income for one year and
one-fifth his net worth. JA468, JA487. Dorozhko’s purchases were also
exceptional in comparison to the market; they represented almost 90% of
all IMS October $25.00 and October $30.00 put options purchased between
September 4, 2007, and October 17, 2007. JA573.
4.	

Following release of the earnings results, IMS stock fell
28% and Dorozhko sold the put options for a net profit
of over $285,000 – an over 600% return in less than one
day.

IMS’s stock closed on October 17 at $29.56 per share and the trading
volume was 832,500 shares. JA573. Ahead of the conference call and
webcast, at 4:33p.m. IMS reported third quarter earnings of 29 cents per
share, which was 28% below the analysts’ consensus estimates of
approximately 40 cents per share and 15% below the previous year’s third
quarter earnings of 34 cents per share. JA573, JA577-579.
When the markets opened the following day, October 18, 2007, IMS’s
stock price plunged 28% to a low of $21.20 per share—the steepest decline
in the stock’s 52-week trading history. JA573. Within six minutes,
8


Dorozhko had sold all of the 630 IMS put options that he had purchased
the previous day, realizing proceeds of $328,571.00 and net profits of
$286,456.59. JA451-463, JA477-480. Almost immediately, Dorozhko’s
broker froze his account. JA463.
C.

Course of the proceedings in the district court

On October 29, 2007, based on the investigation it had been able to do in
the short time since the trading, the Commission filed a complaint charging
Dorozhko with violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by gaining access to
material nonpublic information regarding IMS’s third quarter earnings
through fraudulent devices, schemes or artifices. JA9-10. These devices,
schemes or artifices were alleged to possibly have included, but were not
limited to, hacking into computer networks or otherwise improperly
obtaining electronic access to systems that contained confidential
information about IMS’s imminent earnings release. Id. 4
The complaint was accompanied by an emergency application for a
temporary restraining order, an order freezing assets and granting other

4

A more detailed description of Dorozhko's alleged misconduct is set
forth at JA12-15.
9

relief, and an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not
issue. JA18-120. On October 30, the district court granted the requested
emergency relief, including an asset freeze in the amount of $1,145,826.36,
representing the alleged ill-gotten gains plus three times the amount of
those gains to cover a possible civil penalty. JA18-26. (The only assets of
which the Commission is aware that are subject to the freeze are the
proceeds at the broker from Dorozhko’s fraud.)
By stipulation of the parties, the temporary restraining order, including
the asset freeze, was kept in place until November 28, at which time the
court scheduled a hearing into whether a preliminary injunction should
issue. JA689-691. In the meantime, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint (JA121-148), and the parties filed briefs addressing the dismissal
motion, and the appropriateness of the preliminary injunction and asset
freeze.
The hearing was held as scheduled, and the Commission introduced
evidence in support of its motion for preliminary injunction, after which
the court heard the argument of the parties. JA830-893. The parties then
filed post-hearing briefs addressing the question of whether hacking to

10


obtain nonpublic material information constitutes deception in connection
with the sale of securities. JA891.
On January 8, 2008, the district court entered an order denying the
Commission’s request for a preliminary injunction. JA998-1051. The court
found that the Commission had made a sufficient showing that Dorozhko
had acquired IMS’s earnings information by hacking Thomson Financial’s
computer system and that he had traded based on that information.
JA999-1000. The court further held that the Commission had made a
sufficient showing that the alleged hacking and trading constituted a
“device or contrivance” as those terms are used in Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act (JA1013), and that his scheme was in connection with the
purchase or sale of securities as required by that Section (JA1013-1014).
The district court also found that the Commission would suffer irreparable
harm if the preliminary injunction was not granted because the funds
could move offshore and “it is unlikely that the SEC will be able to
recapture” them. JA1009-1010. However, the court concluded that every
fraud claim under Section 10(b) requires proof of a breach of fiduciary duty
or similar duty of trust and confidence, and that the Commission was

11


unlikely to prevail on the merits of its claim because it had not alleged that
Dorozhko owed IMS or Thomson Financial any fiduciary duty or other
duty of trust and confidence. JA1016-1018.
The court therefore denied the preliminary injunction and also ordered
that the asset freeze be dissolved, but gave the Commission until January
14 to seek a stay pending appeal in this Court. JA1049-1050. The
Commission so moved, and after briefing and argument, this Court
ordered the stay to be maintained until the appeal is decided. JA1171.

S UMMARY OF A RGUMENT
This case presents the important issue of whether hacking into a
computer system in order to obtain confidential information ordinarily
used in trading securities violates the general antifraud provisions of the
Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, which prohibit deceptive devices and contrivances. In the
district court, Dorozhko made two arguments as to why it does not: first,
that hacking is not deceptive, and second, that no conduct is deceptive
within the meaning of the Act unless accompanied by a breach of fiduciary
or similar duty. Relying on traditional insider trading decisions where the
12


fraud occurred when the defendant traded rather than when he obtained
the confidential information, the district court agreed with the second
argument, concluding that a breach of duty is required in all Section 10(b)
violations. This brief demonstrates that both arguments are incorrect.
1. Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act prohibits the employment of “any .
. . deceptive device or contrivance” in connection with the purchase or sale
of securities that violates Commission rules, and the Commission has
adopted Rule 10b-5, which broadly prohibits fraud and deception.
“Deception,” based on the ordinary meaning of the term, includes any
declaration, artifice or practice having the power to mislead, to cause to
believe the false, or to disbelieve the true, as by falsification, concealment,
or cheating; an attempt to lead into error; a trick or a fraud. “Device or
contrivance” includes any scheme to defraud. Dorozhko employed a
deceptive device or contrivance when he hacked into a secure computer
system to obtain confidential information which he then used to trade
securities – he caused the computer system to treat him as though he were
authorized to have access to the information when he was not.

13


2. In a traditional insider trading case, the securities fraud consists not
in how the defendant obtains nonpublic information, but in the buying or
selling of securities based on nonpublic information in breach of a duty to
either refrain from trading or to disclose the intention to trade. In this case,
in contrast, the fraud in this case arises from the fact that Dorozhko
obtained the information through deceptive means. No breach of duty is
required when the defendant engages in affirmatively deceptive conduct,
such as lying, acting deceptively, or telling half truths.

A RGUMENT
The sole ground given by the district court for denying a preliminary
injunction against future violations and for dissolving the asset freeze was
a legal conclusion, namely that conduct can be “deceptive” under Section
10(b) only if it involves a breach of a fiduciary or similar duty. JA1016­
1018; see also, JA1078-1159. This rule of law, if adopted generally by the
courts, would work a revolution in the antifraud provisions of the
Exchange Act because it would mean that buyers and sellers of securities
and others could lie with impunity so long as they did not owe a pre­
existing duty to the targets of their lies.
14


In this brief, after first stating the applicable standards of review, we
show that computer hacking to obtain confidential information is a
“deceptive device or contrivance.” The defendant argued to the contrary
below and is likely to renew the argument on appeal. We then
demonstrate that misrepresentations, including false statements, deceptive
conduct, or half-truths that render statements that were made misleading,
are “deceptive” even if the defendant does not commit a breach of duty
when he makes the misrepresentation.
Because the district court’s decision rested on a mistaken view of the
law, the case should be remanded so that the court may consider whether a
preliminary injunction should be granted under the correct legal standards.
The asset freeze should be maintained in the meantime.
I.	

Standards of review for preliminary injunctions against future
violations and for prejudgment asset freezes.
This Court reviews a district court’s decision to grant or deny a

preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. SEC v. Cavanagh, 155 F.3d
129, 131 (2d Cir. 1998) (injunction granted). A district court’s decision
should be upheld unless it applies legal standards incorrectly or relies
upon clearly erroneous findings of fact. Id. A lesser showing is required to
15


justify a prejudgment asset freeze than for a preliminary injunction against
future violations. Thus, in SEC v. Unifund SAL, 910 F.2d 1028 (2d Cir.
1990), this Court vacated an injunction against future violations but upheld
an asset freeze.
A. Injunction against future violations. A preliminary injunction
against a violation of the securities laws is appropriate if the Commission
makes a substantial showing of likelihood of success as to a current
violation and the risk of repetition. Cavanagh, 155 F.3d at 131. Unlike a
private litigant, the Commission need not show risk of irreparable injury.
Id.
B. Asset freeze. In explaining why an asset freeze requires a lesser
showing of likelihood of success than an injunction against future
violations, this Court noted that “the degree to which the Commission
must show likelihood of success will be reduced where the interim relief
sought is not especially onerous.” Unifund SAL, 910 F.2d at 1040. An asset
freeze is intended to facilitate enforcement of any eventual money
judgment by assuring that any funds that may become due can be
collected, and it does not place a defendant at risk of contempt for

16


subsequent securities law violations. Id. As an ancillary remedy, it may be
granted “even in circumstances where the elements required to support a
traditional SEC injunction have not been established,” and such a remedy
is especially warranted where it is sought for a limited duration. Id.
The Court upheld the freeze in Unifund SAL, even though it denied a
preliminary injunction because the Commission had not yet been able to
make a sufficient showing on one of the elements of its case. Unifund
SAL was an insider trading case where the Court found that the
Commission had sufficiently established “a basis to infer appellants traded
on inside information,” but had not demonstrated that appellants were
tipped in violation of a fiduciary duty, which was an element of the claim
at issue in that case. The Court ruled that the freeze should be kept in
place in order to preserve the Commission’s opportunity to collect funds
that might yet be ordered paid while it was endeavoring to prove this
element at trial. Id. See also Cavanagh, 155 F.3d at 131 (in contrast to
showing required for injunction against future violations, Commission
need only show a likelihood of success on the merits to obtain asset freeze).

17


II.	

Dorozhko employed a “deceptive device or contrivance” within the
meaning of Section 10(b) when he hacked into a secure computer
in order to obtain material nonpublic information.

Section 10(b) declares it unlawful “[t]o use or employ, in connection
with the purchase or sale of any security * * * any manipulative or deceptive
device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the
Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.” 15 U.S.C. 78j(b) (emphasis
added). Rule 10b-5 broadly prohibits fraud and deceit in connection with
the purchase and sale of securities.5 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5.
Given the expansive wording of the Rule, the pivotal issue in this case is
whether Dorozhko’s conduct constituted a deceptive device or contrivance

5

Rule 10b-5 provides:
It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any
facility of any national securities exchange,
(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,
(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, or
(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates
or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in
connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
18

within the meaning of the statute. See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S.
185, 213-14 (1976) (scope of the Rule cannot exceed the scope of Section
10(b)). We believe that Dorozhko’s conduct did fall within the statutory
prohibition because (a) the ordinary meaning of the terms “any ...
deceptive device or contrivance” reaches this type of conduct; (b) this type
of conduct is considered deceptive or fraudulent under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act and under other statutes; and (c) Congress intended
Section 10(b) to be applied to new types of fraudulent schemes that
threaten market integrity and investor confidence.
A.	

Dorozhko’s hacking constituted the employment of a
“deceptive device or contrivance.”
1.	

“Any deceptive device or contrivance” is a broadreaching phrase that covers all schemes to mislead, or to
cause to believe the false, such as by trick, falsification,
concealment, or cheating.

“We start, as always, with the language of the statute.” Knight v.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 128 S. Ct. 782, 787 (2008); accord,
Hochfelder, 425 U.S. at 197. “In interpreting statutory texts courts use the
ordinary meaning of terms unless context requires a different result.”
Gonzales v. Carhart, 127 S. Ct. 1610, 1630 (2007); Hochfelder, 425 U.S. at 198

19


(“commonly accepted meaning”).6 Dictionaries used at the time of drafting
and enactment of a statute are typically used to provide guidance as to the
ordinary meaning of statutory terms. See Amoco Production Co. v. Southern
Ute Indian Tribe, 526 U.S. 865, 874 (1999); Austin v. United States, 509 U.S.
602, 614 n. 7 (1993).
The first relevant term is “any.” The Supreme Court has recently
explained that “read naturally, the word ‘any’ has an expansive meaning,
that is, one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.” Ali v. Federal
Bureau of Prisons, 128 S. Ct. 831, 835-36 (2008), quoting United States v.
Gonzalez, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997) quoting Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary 97 (1976). Thus, Section 10(b) should be construed to apply to
all “deceptive device[s] or contrivance[s].” See, e.g., id.; Affiliated Ute
Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 151 (1972) (the antifraud
provisions, “by statute and rule, are broad and, by repeated use of the
word ‘any,’ are obviously meant to be inclusive”).

6

See also, Gollust v. Mendell, 501 U.S. 115, 124 (1991) (“commonly
understood”); Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622, 642-43 (1988) (“common
parlance”); International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, 439 U.S. 551, 559
(1979) (“commonly held understanding”); SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins.
Co., 359 U.S. 65, 71-73 (1959) (“popular understanding and usage”).
20

For the ordinary meaning of “deceptive device or contrivance,” we turn
to Webster’s International Dictionary (2d ed. 1934), the same dictionary
used by the Supreme Court to define the key terms in Hochfelder. See 425
U.S. at 199 nn. 20, 21 (“device,” “contrivance,” and “manipulative”); see
also, In re Parmalat Securities Litigation, 376 F. Supp. 2d 472, 502 (S.D.N.Y.
2005) (“deceptive”).
These terms have broad, overlapping definitions: “Deceptive” describes
any declaration, artifice or practice having the power to mislead, to cause
to believe the false, or to disbelieve the true, as by falsification,
concealment, or cheating; an attempt to lead into error; a trick or a fraud.7

7

“Deceptive” means “[t]ending to deceive, having power to mislead,
as a deceptive appearance.” “Deceive” means “[t]o cause to believe the
false, or to disbelieve the true.” “Deceit” is the “[a]ct of deceiving, as by
falsification, concealment, or cheating; deception; An attempt to deceive or
lead into error; any declaration, artifice, or practice, which misleads
another, or causes him to believe what is false; a wily device; a trick; a
fraud. Law Any trick, collusion, contrivance, false representation, or
underhand practice, used to defraud another.” Webster’s International
Dictionary 679 (2d ed. 1934).
21

“Device” and “contrivance” refer to all sorts of schemes to deceive. 8
Moreover, a “deceptive device or contrivance” is not limited to oral and
written statements. As the Supreme Court recently confirmed, “[c]onduct
itself can be deceptive.” See Stoneridge Investment Partners v. ScientificAtlanta, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 761, 769 (2008); see also, id. at 775 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (“The Court correctly explains why the statute [10(b)] covers
nonverbal as well as verbal deceptive conduct.”).
2.	

Dorozhko’s conduct in hacking into a secure computer
system to obtain nonpublic information was a
“deceptive device or contrivance.”

“Hacking,” the “circumvention of code-based restrictions on computer
privileges,” occurs in two ways. See Orin S. Kerr, Interpreting “Access” and
“Authorization in Computer Misuse Statutes, 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1596, 1644-45
(Nov. 2003). Hackers either (1) “engage in false identification and

8

As the Court noted in Hochfelder, “device” is “[t]hat which is
devised, or formed by design; a contrivance; an invention; project; scheme;
often, a scheme to deceive; a stratagem; an artifice.” 25 U.S. at 199 n. 20
(quoting Webster’s International Dictionary 580, 713 (2d ed. 1934).
“Contrivance” means “[a] thing contrived or used in contriving; a scheme,
plan or artifice,” and “contrive” means “[t]o devise; to plan; to plot * * * [t]o
fabricate * * * design; invent * * * to scheme * * *.” Id. (quoting Webster’s
International Dictionary 580 (2d ed. 1934)).
22

masquerade as another user who has greater privileges,” e.g., “the user can
use another person’s password, and trick the computer to grant the user
greater privileges that are supposed to be reserved for the true account
holder,” or (2) “exploit a weakness in the code within a program to cause
the program to malfunction in a way that grants the user greater
privileges.” Id. at 1645. “Both cases resemble fraud in the factum because
the computer does not recognize that it is consenting to access by that
particular user. The fraud in the factum voids the authorization, and the
access is legally ‘without authorization.’” Id. at 1655.
The deceptive nature of hacking has led a leading scholar of the
securities laws to conclude that a person who tricks another into divulging
material nonpublic information, whether by deceptive face-to-face conduct
or by hacking into a computer system, commits securities fraud. See Donald
C. Langevoort, 18 Insider Trading: Regulation, Enforcement, and Prevention,
Section 6:14 (2007).
Computer hacking is no less deceptive simply because the hacker uses
the internet to communicate his misleading conduct, or because that
conduct is directed at obtaining confidential information that is stored on a

23


computer. Rather, companies increasingly use computers to perform tasks
that once would have been carried out by human beings, such as granting
and denying access to confidential information. The ultimate target of the
deception is the company that owns the information, and the fact that
deception is communicated through a computer system is of no legal
consequence.9
Turning from these general statements about hacking to the specifics of
Dorozhko’s misconduct, we find that his easily fits within the definition of
“deceptive device or contrivance.” Not all of the details of how Dorozhko
accomplished his hack are known at this time as Dorozhko invoked a Fifth

9

Some courts have analyzed this issue in terms of the computer
being the agent of the deceived party. See Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal.
App. 4th 1559, 1567-68 (1996) (affirming fraud judgment based on
unauthorized access to long distance codes, noting that while “no human
at Thrifty-Tel received and acted on the misrepresentation,” the “reliance
by an agent may be imputed to the principal” and “[w]e view Thrifty-Tel's
computerized network as an agent or legal equivalent”); United States v.
Flowerday, 28 M.J. 705, 707-09 (A.F.C.M.R. 1989) (rejecting claim that
defendant had not obtained telephone services under false pretenses
because he had dialed the number directly without dealing with an
operator, court explained that there is no legal significance in the difference
between an operator who performs certain actions and an electronic device
programmed to perform those same functions because in either case the
telephone company programs its human or mechanical agent to recognize
and respond to specified conditions).
24

Amendment right not to testify (JA406-407), he concealed his exit from the
computer system (infra at 27-28), and some of the details of his hacking
were not fully explored due to concerns about trade secrets (JA833).
Despite these limitations in the record, the district court conducted a
hearing that elicited sufficient evidence from Thomson Financial’s chief
information security officer to establish that Dorozkho’s hacking was
deceptive because he employed deceit to (1) gain unauthorized access to
secured nonpublic information, (2) retrieve the information as if he were an
authorized recipient, and (3) secretly depart from the compromised
computer system.
Furthermore, to the extent that uncertainties in the record are caused by
Dorozhko’s invocation of the Fifth Amendment, a court is permitted to
draw adverse inferences. See Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314, 328
(1999) (“This Court has recognized ‘the prevailing rule that the Fifth
Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil
actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence
offered against them.’”) (quoting Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318
(1976)); Collazos v. United States, 368 F.3d 190, 203-04 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting

25


that where the defendant “deprives the government of the opportunity to
conduct a deposition,” that “itself supports an adverse inference as to the
criminal source and use of the seized currency.”); SEC v. Brennan, 230 F.3d
65, 76-77 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that invocation of Fifth Amendment
permits adverse inferences).
First, Dorozhko employed hacking as a deceptive trick to gain access to
nonpublic information as if he were one of those few persons authorized to
have that access. Access to the information was restricted through a
sophisticated computer security system to representatives of IMS or
Thomson Financial — persons who had a role in either the creation or
lawful distribution of that valuable information. JA847-848, JA841-842. To
overcome these electronic barriers, the district court noted, Dorozhko used
an IP address that was registered in the Netherlands, but that could be
used by Dorozhko while he was anywhere in the world due to a “location­
hiding technique called ‘spoofing.’” JA1005 (emphasis added); see also JA854
(explaining that “‘[s]poofing’ is a technique that hackers use to make their
traffic look like it’s coming from a different IP address”). Dorozkho
probed the website at Thomson Financial in an attempt to gain

26


unauthorized access in order to obtain the nonpublic information. JA846­
847. Indeed, Dorozkho tried to obtain unauthorized access to the secured
computer system “three times” in an “attempt[] to access the information.”
JA1005-1006; JA845-847.
Using a hacking device, Dorozkho was eventually able to “breach
Thomson Financial’s security system.” JA-1006. Once access was gained,
he continued his deceptive activity by viewing and downloading the slides
containing nonpublic information one-by-one as if he were an authorized
recipient of the information. Id.; see also, JA847-848, JA851.
Finally, Dorozkho’s egress was also fraudulently accomplished. It took
days even to detect that the computer system was compromised. JA848.
Although there is, in the district court’s words, “powerful” evidence that
ties Dorozkho to this deceptive handiwork, his retreat from the security
system was so surreptitious that all of the tracks of his fraud have not been
completely traced to date, and may never be. JA1007 (“the hacker’s IP

27


address has not been traced at this stage”).10 In sum, Dorozkho employed
hacking deceptively to enter, plunder, and abscond.
B.	

Conduct similar to Dorozhko’s is deemed fraudulent or
deceptive under other antifraud statutes.

Dorozhko concedes that “a person who trades through fraud but not in
violation of a fiduciary duty can be prosecuted for federal crimes, such as
computer, mail, or wire fraud.” JA1090 (citing JA1001-1002). What he fails
to recognize is that the concepts of fraud and deceit in other statutes rely
on the same “common understanding” of those terms as does Section
10(b). Thus, it is not surprising to find that courts have reached the sound
conclusion that someone who deceptively obtains access to confidential

10

See, e.g., SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 49 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming jury
verdict on 10(b) where evidence that the defendant “intended to conceal”
his “deceptive trading practices” was “consistent with, and admissible to
demonstrate” his liability) (emphasis added); United States v. Berger, 473 F.3d
1080, 1085 (9th Cir. 2007) (affirming jury verdict on Section 10(b) claim
where part of the defendant’s deception was “to conceal the fraudulent
nature” of financial misstatements); United States v. Autunoff, 1 F.3d 1112,
1115-1117 (10th Cir. 1993) (same).
28

information stored in a computer has engaged in fraud or deceit. 11
Relevant decisions include (a) the two Cherif decisions from the Seventh
Circuit, one a Commission case under Section 10(b) and the other a
criminal conviction under the mail and wire fraud statute; (b) decisions
under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; and (c) decisions under other
provisions of the law.
1.	

The two Cherif decisions find that unauthorized
electronic access for the purpose of obtaining
confidential information is a form of fraud under both
Section 10(b) and the mail fraud statute.

Danny Cherif devised a “simple, cunning scheme” to obtain
confidential information that he could use to place profitable securities
trades. SEC v. Cherif, 933 F.2d 403, 406 (7th Cir. 1991). After Cherif’s
employment at a bank was terminated, he continued to use his magnetic
identification card to enter the bank building, despite an electronic security
system that restricted access to the building to current employees. After

11

As the quotation from his Stay Opp. suggests (JA1090), the only
distinction Dorozhko has offered between these other statutes and Section
10(b) is his assertion that all Section 10(b) claims require proof of breach of
a fiduciary duty in addition to a deceptive act. We show that this breachof-duty argument is without merit in the next section of this brief.
29

entry, he went to a department of the bank that kept information about
upcoming corporate transactions. He traded securities based on some of
the nonpublic material information he found there. The Commission sued
him for violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, SEC v. Cherif, 933 F.2d 403,
and he was also indicted and convicted for mail and wire fraud, United
States v. Cherif, 943 F.2d 692 (7th Cir. 1991). In both cases the court found
that his conduct was fraudulent under the “common understanding” of
that term, looking specifically to Supreme Court decisions construing the
mail fraud statute for that understanding.
The district court in the Commission’s case granted a preliminary
injunction against future violations and an asset freeze. Cherif appealed on
the ground that he had not committed securities fraud. In affirming the
district court’s decision, the court of appeals observed that Cherif’s actions
were “fraudulent in the common understanding of the word because they
deprived some person of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or
overreaching.” 933 F.2d 403, 411-12 (7th Cir. 1991) (emphasis added),

30


quoting decisions under the mail fraud statute, including McNally v. United
States, 483 U.S. 350, 358 (1987).12
The court of appeals also affirmed Cherif’s mail and wire fraud
convictions.13 Cherif claimed that he had “obtained the bank’s information
by trespass or burglary, not by fraud.” United States v. Cherif, 943 F.2d at
696. The court of appeals responded that “[t]his contention cannot be
serious” because, among other fraudulent acts, “every time he used the
keycard Cherif, in effect, falsely represented that he was a bank employee

12

The decision in the Commission’s case against Cherif ultimately
turned on the court’s conclusion that Cherif continued to owe a fiduciary
duty to the bank even after his employment terminated, so that he was
liable for insider trading under the misappropriation theory, which
requires proof that defendant breached a duty of disclosure. 933 F.2d at
411. The court therefore did not have to reach the question of whether the
fraudulent entry alone could have been a basis for finding a violation of
Section 10(b) in the absence of that duty, but this fact does not change the
court’s express statement that the conduct was fraudulent in the “common
understanding.”
13

These statutes make it a crime for a person who “having devised . .
. a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money or property by means of
false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises” to use the mail
or wires “for the purpose of executing the scheme.” 943 F.2d at 695. The
indictment alleged that Cherif devised a scheme to defraud the bank and
its clients of confidential information by reactivating his identification card
and using it to enter the bank to obtain the information, and then using the
information to obtain money by trading securities. Id.
31

entitled to be in the bank.” Id. The court explained that the “common
understanding” of “to defraud” in the mail fraud statute is “wronging one
in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes.”14
By tricking Thomson Financial’s computer system into providing him
IMS’s nonpublic information as if he were one of those few persons
entitled to access such information, Dorozhko likewise committed fraud.
In other words, Cherif hacked into a building and Dorozkho hacked into a
computer system; both violated Section 10(b) by gaining, through trickery,
unauthorized access to nonpublic information for the purpose of trading.
2.	

Gaining unauthorized access to a computer system for
the purpose of obtaining confidential information is a
form of fraud under the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act.

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) addresses “[f]raud and
related activity in connection with computers.” Section 1030(a)(4) of the
CFAA provides that whoever “knowingly and with intent to defraud,
accesses” a computer covered by the Act “without authorization, or

14

The court’s statement of the “common understanding” of “to
defraud” quotes a different phrase in the same sentence from McNally that
the court quoted in defining “fraud” in the Commission’s case.
32

exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the
intended fraud and obtains anything of value” shall be punished as
provided in the Act. See 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(4) (emphasis added). Courts
have readily applied this statute to remedy unauthorized access to obtain
confidential information.
For example, in Creative Computing the Ninth Circuit affirmed a jury
verdict and permanent injunction under the CFAA where the officers of a
trucking company “hacked into the code [that a rival trucking company]
used to operate its website,” “examined the source code,” and obtained
access to its competitor’s “tremendously valuable” data. Creative
Computing v. Getloaded.com LLC, 386 F.3d 930, 932 (9th Cir. 2004).
Defendants also successfully guessed login names and passwords that
enabled them to gain access to the information. The court described this
conduct as “in effect impersonating the trucking company to sneak into”
the other company’s website. 386 F.3d at 932. “These tricks enabled
[defendants] to see all of the information available to [the other company’s]
bona fide customers.” Id. On appeal, the defendant did not challenge the
finding that its conduct violated Section 1030(a)(4), but instead only

33


claimed that plaintiff’s injury did not meet the statutory jurisdictional
amount.15
3.	

Hacking, including hacking to obtain access to
confidential information, is also a form of fraud under
legal provisions other than the CFAA.

Courts also do not hesitate to conclude that computer “hacking” is a
form of fraudulent deception outside the CFAA context. For example, in
United States v. Riggs, 739 F. Supp. 414, 418-19 (N.D. Ill. 1990), the district
court refused to dismiss an indictment alleging that the defendant
committed wire fraud when he participated in a scheme to hack into a
phone company computer in order to obtain confidential information,

15

Other cases in which defendants who hacked into computer
systems in order to obtain confidential information were convicted under
Section 1030(a)(4) include: United States v. Peterson, 98 F.3d 502, 504 (9th
Cir. 1996) (affirming defendant’s sentence under Section 1030(a)(4) where
the defendant hacked into a consumer credit reporting agency to obtain
information that he used to order credit cards); United States v. Sykes, 4 F.3d
697 (8th Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (affirming sentence for violation of Section
1030(a)(4) for unauthorized use of an automatic teller machine card and
personal identification number); see also, United States v. Ivanov, 175 F.
Supp. 2d 367, 371-72 (D. Conn. 2001) (denying motion to dismiss
indictment under Section 1030(a)(4) where Russian national hacked into
retail transaction clearinghouse’s computer and obtained credit card data).
34

ruling that the hacking constituted a “fraudulent means” of accessing the
computer.
Courts adjudge hacking to be deceptive using traditional – not
innovative – legal principles. When a hacker penetrates a system that was
designed to provide access to confidential information to a limited set of
authorized individuals, he misrepresents his identity and authority. See,
e.g., United States v. Miller, 70 F.3d 1353, 1355 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“Each time
Miller inserted Rolark’s card into an ATM and entered her personal fourdigit code, he represented to [the bank] that he had authority to withdraw
funds from Rolark’s account”); Thrifty-Tel, 46 Cal. App. 4th at 1567
(affirming civil fraud judgment, where the fraud cause of action “applies a
hoary common law theory to computer-age facts,” namely that defendants’
“use of the confidential access code was the legal equivalent of a
misrepresentation that they were authorized users of its services, and
plaintiff relied to its detriment on that misrepresentation when its
computer automatically granted them access to the network”); State v.
Hamm, 569 S.W.2d 289, 290-91 (Mo. Ct. App. 1978) (by using someone
else’s ATM card, “defendant represented falsely that he did have authority

35


to use the” card). Likewise, access to the nonpublic information here was
restricted by Thomson Financial to authorized individuals (JA1006, JA848),
and in accessing and using that information Dorozhko falsely represented
that he possessed such authorization.
C.	

Congress intended Section 10(b) to be applied to new types of
fraudulent schemes that threaten market integrity and
investor confidence.

The district court observed that “in the 74 years since Congress passed
the Exchange Act, no federal court has ever held that the theft of material
nonpublic information by a corporate outsider and subsequent trading on
that information violates § 10(b).” JA1000 (emphasis in original), JA1038­
1040. The fact that there has not been a previous hacking case litigated
under the Exchange Act, however, is not dispositive because both
Congress and the Supreme Court have endorsed the view that Section
10(b) should be applied to remedy new forms of fraudulent schemes as

36


well as the more familiar ones.16
For instance, this Court did not recognize its first insider trading case
until SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833 (2d Cir. 1968), some 34
years after passage of the Exchange Act. The Court did not stop at the fact
that there had not been a previous case holding that trading on material,
nonpublic information is fraudulent, but instead applied established legal
principles to the conduct to find a violation. As this Court has observed in
another context, “[t]he fact that there is no litigated fact pattern precisely in
point may constitute a tribute to the cupidity and ingenuity of the
malefactors involved but hardly provides an escape from [the remedies of]
the securities fraud provisions.” United States v. Brown, 555 F.2d 336,
339-40 (2d Cir. 1977). There have not been previous litigated cases like this
one, but this one will likely not be the last.

16

If the district court was suggesting that Dorozhko’s conduct was
not deceptive because it was a form of theft, it was in error. We have just
demonstrated that Dorozhko committed deception, and the mere fact that
a deceptive scheme may involve some conduct that would qualify as theft
does not deprive the conduct of its deceptive nature. Cf., Model Penal
Code § 223.3 (theft by deception).
37

As the Supreme Court has explained, the legislative history of the
Exchange Act makes clear that Section 10(b) is intended to reach all sorts of
fraudulent schemes; that history describes the provision as a “catchall”
against fraud in its various forms, including newly created types.
Hochfelder, 425 U.S. at 202, quoting Hearings on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720
before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73d
Cong., 2d Sess., 115 (1934). Thomas Corcoran, the Act’s principal drafter,
famously emphasized the provision’s role as a supplement to the specific
prohibitions contained in other sections of the Act by paraphrasing it as
“Thou shalt not devise any other cunning devices.” Id. In short, “Section
10(b) and Rule 10b-5 prohibit all fraudulent schemes in connection with the
purchase or sale of securities, whether the artifices employed involve a
garden type variety of fraud, or present a unique form of deception,”
because “[n]ovel or atypical methods should not provide immunity from
the securities laws.” Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co.,
404 U.S. 6, 11 n.7 (1971) (quoting A. T. Brod & Co. v. Perlow, 375 F.2d 393,
397 (2d Cir. 1967)).

38


Certainly the harm caused by Dorozhko’s misconduct is not new.
Indeed, it is the same sort of harm to market integrity and investor
confidence that is caused by trading in breach of a fiduciary duty. The
Supreme Court explained this harm when it accepted the misappropriation
theory of insider trading liability in O’Hagan:
[a]lthough informational disparity is inevitable in the

securities markets, investors likely would hesitate to

venture their capital in a market where trading based on

misappropriated nonpublic information is unchecked by

law. An investor’s informational disadvantage vis-à-vis a

misappropriator with material, nonpublic information

stems from contrivance, not luck; it is a disadvantage that

cannot be overcome with research or skill.

United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 658-59 (1997); see also, United States v.
Carpenter, 791 F.2d 1024, 1030-31 (2d Cir. 1986), aff'd by equally divided court
sub nom., Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19 (1987).
O’Hagan involved trading by a lawyer who misappropriated
information that had been entrusted to him by trading on it in breach of a
fiduciary duty, while Dorozhko used deception in obtaining the
information. The danger to the markets is the same in each case – whether
a fraudfeasor misappropriates lawfully obtained information or instead
deceives the owner of the information into revealing it, his misconduct
39


threatens investors’ confidence, making it less likely that they would
venture their capital into the United States securities markets.
The problem only threatens to get worse in the future given that
hacking in connection with securities trading is an increasingly common
phenomenon. See, e.g., SEC v. Stummer, 1:2008CV03671 (DAB) (S.D.N.Y.
April 17, 2008) (settled case against alleged computer hacker trading on
material nonpublic information); SEC v. Lohmus Haavel & Viisemann, et al.,
05 CV 9259 (RWS) (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 1, 2005) (same); SEC v. Blue Bottle Ltd.,
07-cv-01380 (CSH) (KNF) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2007) (default judgment
obtained against alleged computer hackers trading on material nonpublic
information). Congress enacted the expansive language of Section 10(b) to
reach deceitful schemes known to it in 1934 and those yet to be invented.
Applying the statute to Dorozhko’s conduct effectuates that Congressional
purpose.
III.	 A lie, trickery, or half-truth is “deceptive” whether or not the
person making the misrepresentation is acting in breach of a
fiduciary duty.
Dorozhko successfully persuaded the district court that his conduct was
not “deceptive” because, he claimed, every violation of Section 10(b)

40


requires proof of a breach of fiduciary duty, even where the defendant lies,
engages in misleading conduct, or tells half-truths, and Dorozhko did not
owe a fiduciary duty to IMS or Thomson Financial.17 Though the district
court found that Dorozhko’s conduct was a device or contrivance, it agreed
that his conduct was not deceptive. After an extensive discussion of the
law of insider trading cases, which hold that trading in breach of a
fiduciary duty is a form of fraud (JA1018-1049), the court concluded that “a
breach of fiduciary duty of disclosure is a required element of any
‘deceptive’ device under § 10(b)” JA1017-1018 (emphasis added). The
court looked at traditional insider trading decisions, where the fraud
consists not in how the information is obtained, but in the fact that it is
used to make securities trades. As we have noted, however, this is not
such a case.
It is difficult to overstate the degree to which Dorozhko’s argument is
both extraordinary and untenable. To take only one striking consequence,

17

He repeated this argument in this Court in opposition to the
Commission’s motion to maintain the asset freeze pending appeal – “a
violation of § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 necessarily entails a breach of fiduciary
or similar duty.” JA1097.
41

under Dorozhko’s view the well-known form of fraud known as a “pump­
and-dump” – in which fraudfeasors acquire a block of shares in a
company, engage in fraudulent conduct to increase the price, and then use
a fraudulent sales campaign to sell the stock to unsuspecting strangers
before the truth is disclosed – will no longer be subject to Rule 10b-5 except
in the unusual situation where the perpetrators of the scheme owe a
fiduciary duty to the investors they deceive.
As we discuss in detail below, fraud and deceit under both the common
law and the securities laws are governed by well-established principles: A
material misrepresentation, which includes false statements, deceptive
actions, and half-truths that render statements made misleading, is
fraudulent. Silence, on the other hand, is not deceptive unless a duty to
speak is created by a fiduciary relationship or other source.
Dorozhko’s interpretation would turn these principles on their head.
Instead of being a special case that can give rise to a fraud claim even
without an affirmative misrepresentation, the existence of a fiduciary duty
would be the predicate to all fraud claims, so that even out-and-out lies
would not be deemed “deceptive” unless the liar was breaching a duty in

42


addition to telling lies. The notion that a lie is not deceptive unless it also
breaches a duty is contrary to the plain language and legislative history of
Section 10(b), to the common law background against which the securities
laws were enacted, to existing case law recognizing that a Section 10(b)
violation can be based on fraudulent or deceptive acts without a breach of
duty, and to good policy.
A.	

The language and legislative history of Section 10(b)
establish that it reaches all deceptive devices and
contrivances, with no requirement of a breach of duty.

We have already discussed the breadth of the language of Section 10(b),
and its legislative history, which refers to the provision as a “catchall” and
as a prohibition on all cunning schemes, whether new or old. Supra at 19­
22, 36-40. The notion that what Congress really meant when it enacted
Section 10(b) is that fiduciaries – who already had a duty to make full
disclosure – are the only ones also prohibited from making affirmative
misrepresentations, is simply implausible.

43


B. 	

The Supreme Court has explained that Section 10(b) follows
the common law rule that deception may be shown either by
affirmative misrepresentations or by silence in breach of a
duty of disclosure.
1.	

The distinction between fraud through affirmative
misrepresentation and fraud through breach of duty is
most clearly illustrated in the Court’s insider trading
cases.

The general rule that misrepresentations are fraudulent, but that silence
is fraudulent only if there is a duty to disclose, is clearly explained in the
Supreme Court’s insider trading cases. The first case in which the Supreme
Court recognized that insider trading was a deceptive device or
contrivance under Section 10(b) even though the defendant had not made
an affirmative misrepresentation was Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222
(1980) . That case involved an employee of a financial printing company
who traded securities based on information that he learned in the course of
his employment. 445 U.S. at 224. The employee was convicted of violating
Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and he appealed to the Supreme Court on the
ground that merely trading based on material, nonpublic information was
not securities fraud.

44


The Court observed that the case “concerns the legal effect of the
[defendant’s] silence.” 445 U.S. at 226. To ascertain that effect, it first
looked to the language of the statute and the legislative history, but neither
of these provided specific guidance as to whether “silence may constitute a
manipulative or deceptive device.” Id.
However, the Court noted, the common law had long held that silence
can be fraudulent when the failure to speak breaches a duty to disclose.
The Court explained that the Commission, correctly applying common law
principles, had held that corporate insiders had “an affirmative duty to
disclose material information which has been traditionally imposed on
corporate ‘insiders,’ particularly officers, directors, or controlling
stockholders” when they sell securities of the corporation, and that the
failure to comply with that disclosure obligation was a violation of Section
10(b). 445 U.S. at 227, quoting Cady, Roberts & Co., 40 S.E.C. 907, 911 (1961).
The Commission’s conclusion rested on the reasoning of Judge Learned
Hand that “the director or officer assumed a fiduciary relation to the buyer
by the very sale . . ..” 40 S.E.C. at 914 n.23, quoting Gratz v. Claughton, 187
F.2d 46, 49 (2d Cir. 1951).

45


The Supreme Court went on to explain that the Commission’s view was
well-founded in the common law:
At common law, misrepresentation made for the purpose of
inducing reliance upon the false statement is fraudulent. But one
who fails to disclose material information prior to the
consummation of a transaction commits fraud only when he is
under a duty to do so. And the duty to disclose arises when
one party has information “that the other [party] is entitled
to know because of a fiduciary or other similar relation of
trust and confidence between them.”
445 U.S. at 227-28 (emphasis added).
After reviewing court decisions applying this rule in securities cases, the
Court concluded that “silence in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities may operate as a fraud actionable under Section 10(b)” where
there is “a duty to disclose arising from a relationship of trust and
confidence between parties to a transaction.” 445 U.S. at 230.18
Thus, the courts and commentators typically state that the deception
element under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 as requiring proof of either “a

18

The principle that silence is fraudulent only when there is a duty
to disclose has been applied in the Court’s subsequent insider trading
cases, where the dispositive issue in each case has been whether the
defendant owed a duty such that failure to make disclosure violated
Section 10(b). See, e.g., O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642 (adopting misappropriation
theory of liability).
46

material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he had a
duty to speak.” SEC v. Monarch Funding Corp., 192 F.3d 295, 308 (2d Cir.
1999) (emphasis added). See also Arnold S. Jacobs, Disclosure and Remedies
Under the Securities Laws Database Part III, Ch. 12.VII.B (March, 2008)
(“While some duty must be owed by the defendant to the plaintiff in
complete silence cases, under the duty theory, liability for
misrepresentations flows absent a fiduciary or other duty between the
plaintiff and the defendant.”).
2.	

The Supreme Court has recognized that fraud may be
based on either misrepresentations or failure to speak
in violation of a duty in non-insider trading cases as
well.

A recent example where the Court recognized that fraud can be
committed either by misrepresentation or by breach of duty is Stoneridge,
128 S. Ct. 761. The issue in that case was whether plaintiffs in a private
damages suit could recover from defendants who had allegedly
participated in arrangements that allowed a securities issuer to mislead its
auditor and issue misleading financial statements affecting its stock price,
but who had no role in preparing or disseminating the financial statement.
The Court ultimately held that plaintiffs could not recover from these
47


defendants because plaintiffs had not relied on defendants’ statements or
representations.
In the course of reaching that conclusion, the Court reviewed the
causation requirements for a private right of action under Section 10(b). It
explained that proof of reliance on the defendant’s “deceptive acts” is
ordinarily required, but that reliance may be presumed in two situations,
one where the fraud involves failure to disclose in breach of a duty, and
where the defendant has made an affirmative misstatement. The first
presumption arises “if there is an omission of a material fact by one with a
duty to disclose,” while the second is present in a case governed by the
“fraud-on-the-market” doctrine, “when the statements at issue become
public.” Neither presumption applied in Stoneridge – the first because
defendant “had no duty to disclose” and the second because defendants
“deceptive acts were not communicated to the public.” 128 S.Ct. at 769.
Thus, the Court clearly recognized that duty is not required in cases
where there has been affirmatively deceptive conduct – if a duty to disclose
were always an element of a Section 10(b) case, there would have been no
need to find that the statements had not been communicated to the public

48


because the case would have been disposed of by the absence of an
allegation that defendants owed a duty.
Another case demonstrating that misrepresentations may be the basis
for a Section 10(b) claim even without a duty is Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485
U.S. 224, 240 n.18 (1988), where the Court declined to recognize two
different standards of materiality, one for “situations where insiders have
traded in abrogation of their duty to disclose or abstain” and another
covering “affirmative misrepresentations by those under no duty to
disclose (but under the ever-present duty not to mislead)” (emphasis added).
The question whether one or two standards were appropriate would have
been meaningless if every Section 10(b) case required proof of breach of
duty, even when the defendant has violated the “ever-present duty not to
mislead.” As in Stoneridge, the Court proceeded from the premise that an
affirmative deception is a basis for Section 10(b) liability without any
breach of duty.
C.	

This Court has recognized that fraud can violate Section 10(b)
even if there is no breach of fiduciary duty.

This Court has reviewed many securities fraud cases, and it has never
required proof of a breach of a duty when the defendant has made an
49


affirmative misrepresentation or engaged in deceptive conduct. See, e.g., In
re NYSE Specialists Sec. Litig., 503 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that
Rule 10b-5 reaches misstatements by “bankers and non-issuer sellers”).
The issue has not previously come up in the way it does here, perhaps
because no one has ever suggested before that an affirmative
misrepresentation is not deceptive. But there are at least two areas where
this Court has explicitly said that there can be deception under Section
10(b) without breach of duty – pump-and-dump schemes and market
manipulations.
1. Pump-and-Dump Schemes. This Court has expressly held in a
criminal case that a pump-and-dump scheme violates Section 10(b) and
Rule 10b-5 even though defendants did not act in breach of a fiduciary
duty. See United States v. Skelly, 442 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 2006). The
government’s primary theory of liability was that defendants pumped up
the price of the securities “and then used fraudulent and high-pressure
tactics to unload (‘dump’) the securities on unsuspecting customers.” 442
F.3d at 96. However, the government also offered an alternative theory
that the defendants breached a fiduciary duty towards their customers.

50


Defendants were convicted in a general verdict, and they claimed that their
convictions should be reversed because the district court misinstructed the
jury on the circumstances under which a fiduciary duty is created.
This Court rejected the challenge. First of all, it noted that breach of
duty is relevant in failure to disclose cases, not in affirmative
misrepresentation cases: “a seller or middleman may be liable for fraud if
he lies to the purchaser or tells him misleading half-truths, but not if he
simply fails to disclose information that he is under no obligation to
reveal.” 442 F.3d at 97. Then it held that any error in the instruction on
the government’s fiduciary theory duty theory was not prejudicial to
defendant because there was ample evidence that defendants engineered a
pump-and-dump scheme, and it was overwhelmingly likely that any
reasonable jury would have convicted based on that theory. 442 F.3d at 98.
In other words, this Court affirmed the verdict on the ground that
defendants’ affirmative fraudulent conduct was clearly proven, even
assuming that the fiduciary duty theory was not properly presented to the
jury.

51


2. Manipulation. A second area where this Court has upheld findings
of violations under Section 10(b) without proof of a fiduciary duty is
market manipulation, i.e., practices such as wash sales, matched orders, or
rigged prices “that are intended to mislead investors by artificially
affecting market activity.” ATSI Comm., Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87,
99-100 (2d Cir. 2007). Section 10(b) covers “manipulative” devices and
contrivances as well as deceptive ones, while Rule 10b-5 forbids fraudulent
and deceitful conduct but does not use the word “manipulative.”
Manipulation is prohibited by Rule 10b-5 because it involves “intentional
or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling
or artificially affecting the price of securities.” Id., 493 F.3d at 100, quoting
Hochfelder, 425 U.S. at 199.19
For our purposes here, the key conclusion is this Court’s statement that
Rule 10b-5 forbids market manipulation, which is a form of deception,

19

Indeed, this Court requires “a showing that an alleged
manipulator engaged in market activity aimed at deceiving investors as to
how other market participants have valued a security,” deception that
arises from the fact that “investors are misled to believe that prices at
which they purchase and sell securities are determined by the natural
interplay of supply and demand, not rigged by manipulators.” ATSI, 493
F.3d at 100 (internal quotation and citation omitted).
52

“regardless of whether there is a fiduciary relationship between the
transaction participants.” Id., 493 F.3d at 101. Thus, manipulation is a
second example where this Court has expressly found that deception
under Section 10(b) does not require proof of a fiduciary duty.
D.	

The district court’s error was in applying the special rules
that govern fraud-through-breach-of-duty-to-disclose, such as
in traditional insider trading cases, to a case where there was
active deception.

The district court’s fundamental error was in analyzing Dorozhko’s
conduct under theories of liability that apply when a fiduciary, after
obtaining information lawfully, trades in breach of a duty to either disclose
his intention to trade or to refrain from doing so. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642
(partner in law firm had non-fraudulent access to confidential client
information); Chiarella, 445 U.S. 222 (employee of printer had nonfraudulent access to confidential customer information). The fraud in that
type of case is “consummated, not when the fiduciary gains the confidential
information, but when, without disclosure to his principal, he uses the
information to purchase or sell securities.” See O’Hagan, 521 U.S. at 656
(emphasis added); Chiarella, 445 U.S. at 227-28. In the present case, in
contrast, the fraud was the affirmative conduct by which Dorozhko
53


deceptively obtained the information. Nothing in the language of the
statute imposes a duty requirement when the wrongdoer defrauds through
acts of deception rather than by remaining silent.
An argument very similar to Dorozhko’s was rejected in United States v.
Riggs, 739 F. Supp. at 418-19, a case that was discussed above in showing
that Dorozhko’s conduct was deceptive. Supra at 34-35. Like Dorozhko,
the defendant in that case claimed that he could not be liable for
fraudulently obtaining confidential information because he owed no
fiduciary duty to the phone company, the owner of the information. He
cited Dirks v. SEC, 463 U.S. 646 (1983), one of the Supreme Court’s insider
trading cases, in support of this assertion. The district court rejected his
argument, distinguishing Dirks on the ground that in that case the
defendant “c[a]me upon information lawfully” and then breached a
fiduciary duty by trading without making required disclosure, while in the
case then before it the defendant had participated in a scheme to
fraudulently obtain the information in the first place. Riggs, 739 F. Supp. at
419 (original emphasis). This analysis applies equally to Dorozhko.

54


C ONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s denial of a preliminary
