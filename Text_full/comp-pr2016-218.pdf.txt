Plaintiff,
COMPLAINT
[Securities Fraud]

v.
LIME ENERGY CO., JAMES G.
SMITH, JULIANNE M.
CHANDLER, JOAQUIN
ALBERTO DOS SANTOS
ALMEIDA, AND KARAN RAINA,

1:16-CV-8088
ECF CASE

Defendants.
Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
“Commission”), alleges as follows:
SUMMARY
1.

In 2010 and 2011, Defendant Lime Energy Co. (“Lime”) improperly recognized

millions of dollars of revenue earlier than appropriate under generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) and millions of dollars of non-existent revenue, and in publicly filed
quarterly and annual reports that misstated a total of more than $33 million of such revenue. In
May 2012, Lime’s false financial statements were used in the offer and sale of $2.55 million of
common stock to one of Lime’s directors.
2.

Defendant Joaquin Alberto Dos Santos Almeida (“Almeida”), known at Lime as Jack

Almeida, and Defendant Karan Raina (“Raina”), worked in Lime’s Utilities Division and, under
substantial pressure from a senior manager to help meet company-wide revenue goals, began to
knowingly and intentionally recognize millions of dollars of revenue earlier than appropriate
starting no later than 2010.
3.

Starting in January 2012, Almeida and Raina, together with Lime Energy Executive

Vice President of Operations James G. Smith (“Smith”), knowingly and intentionally recognized
1

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 2 of 27

millions of dollars of improper revenue from the Utilities Division to help Lime meet its 2011
revenue targets. Separately, in late 2011 and early 2012, Smith knowingly and intentionally
directed the booking of more than $500,000 of improper revenue from the company’s Public
Sector Division earlier than appropriate in order to help Lime meet its 2011 revenue targets.
4.

Lime’s Corporate Controller Julianne M. Chandler (“Chandler”), who helped

establish Lime’s internal accounting controls to ensure revenue was properly recorded, failed to
follow those controls during the relevant time period and recklessly participated in the improper
recognition of revenue by both the Utilities Division and Public Sector.
5.

Through the actions and misconduct of its employees, Lime violated Section 10(b)

of the Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)],
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Exchange Act
Rules 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5], Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], and Exchange Act Rules
13a-1 and l3a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13].
6.

The misconduct of Smith, Chandler, and Almeida related to Lime’s improper

revenue recognition violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) and 13b2-1. Raina’s
misconduct related to Lime’s improper revenue recognition also violated Section 17(a)(3) of the
Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The
misconduct of Smith, Chandler, Almeida, and Raina also aided and abetted Lime’s violations of
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 13(a), and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act,
and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
7.

This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Securities Act Sections 20

and 22(a) [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t and 77v(a)] and Exchange Act Sections 21 and 27 [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u

and 78aa].
8.

Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of

interstate commerce or the mails, or a facility of a national securities exchange, in connection
with the conduct alleged herein.
9.

Venue is proper because, among other reasons, Lime stock was publicly traded on

the NASDAQ Capital Market, which is headquartered in this judicial district, and Lime’s
Utilities Division and Public Sector Division both transacted business within this judicial district.
DEFENDANTS
10.

Lime is a Delaware corporation that was formed in December 1997 as Electric City

LLC but ultimately became Lime Energy Co. in 2006 to reflect its new Energy Efficiency
Services focus (“Lime” is an acronym for “Less is More Efficient”). Its headquarters are in
Newark, New Jersey. During the relevant time period, Lime had its headquarters, first, in Elk
Grove Village, Illinois, and then, beginning in August 2011, in Huntersville, North Carolina.
During the relevant time period, Lime had a Public Sector Division that was located in North
Carolina and a Utilities Division that maintained offices in New Jersey and New York. Both of
these divisions serviced customers in those regions and this judicial district. During the relevant
time period, Lime’s common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol
“LIME.” Its stock is now quoted on the OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC
Markets Group, Inc.

FACTS
I.

LIME’S CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS

15.

During the relevant time period, Lime was in the business of planning and

delivering clean energy solutions to assist clients in achieving their energy efficiency and
renewable energy goals. Lime operated in three specific markets – the utility market, the public
sector and institutional market, and the commercial and industrial market – and its clients
included utilities, energy service companies, government entities, educational institutions,
commercial and industrial businesses, and property owners and managers. Lime’s Public Sector
Division was located in North Carolina, and its Utilities Division had offices in New Jersey and
New York. Both divisions serviced customers in those regions.
16.

Lime focused on deploying solutions to improve building energy efficiency, reduce

energy-related expenditures and the impact of energy use on the environment, thereby helping its
clients save money, improve their facilities, and meet their energy efficiency goals and
mandates. Lime provided energy solutions across a range of facilities, from high-rise office
buildings, distribution facilities, manufacturing plants, retail sites, multi-tenant residential
buildings, mixed use complexes, hospitals, colleges and universities, and large government sites
to small, single-tenant facilities. Lime’s solutions include energy efficient lighting upgrades,
energy efficient mechanical and electrical retrofit and upgrade services, water conservation,
building weatherization, on-site generation, and renewable energy project development and
implementation.

SMITH, CHANDLER, ALMEIDA, AND RAINA IMPROPERLY
RECOGNIZED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUE

17.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards

Codification (“ASC”) 605-10-25-1 set forth, among other things, the requirements for the
recognition of revenue by an entity in its internal accounting records and publicly filed financial
statements. “Revenue and gains generally are not recognized until realized or realizable,” which
occurs “when products (goods or services), merchandise, or other assets are exchanged for cash
or claims to cash” and when “related assets received or held are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash or claims to cash.” FASB ASC 605-10-25-1(a). “[R]evenue is not recognized
until earned. . . . [A]n entity’s revenue-earning activities involve delivering or producing goods,
rendering services, or other activities that constitute its ongoing major or central operations, and
revenues are considered to have been earned when the entity has substantially accomplished
what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues.” FASB ASC 605-1025-1(b).
18.

In 2010, the fastest growing division at Lime Energy was its Utilities Division,

which performed a large number of relatively small jobs pursuant to energy efficiency programs
run by large utilities. It recognized revenue from its jobs using the percentage of completion
method, recognizing revenue on a job in the same percentage as the percentage of costs incurred
for that job. For example, the incurrence of 50% of a job’s anticipated expense would allow
recognition of 50% of a job’s anticipated revenue. Thus, generally speaking, as the expenses
incurred on a job increased, so did the revenues.
19.

Lime’s internal accounting controls did not require documentary support for the

Utilities Division’s journal entries to be given to the company’s financial reporting personnel,
and as a consequence the financial reporting personnel entered cost information from the
Utilities Division into the accounting system relying only on assurances operations personnel
6

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 7 of 27

that documentary support for the entries existed.

Lime’s Utilities Division book-keeping

personnel who prepared the journal entries that recorded expenses for the Division did not have
any reporting responsibility to the company’s accounting or financial reporting personnel, and
instead reported solely to the Utilities Division’s operations management.
20.

Beginning in at least 2010, Almeida, the Vice President of Operations for the

Utilities Division, worked with his direct report, Raina, the Division’s Director of Operations, to
have revenue recognized on some jobs for which Lime Energy did not yet have the requisite
documentation of its corresponding costs. In some cases, the expenses had been incurred, but the
company had not yet received the documentation; in other instances, the documentation had not
been received because the relevant expenses had not in fact yet been incurred. Raina, in turn,
directed the employees who recorded the Division’s expenses to record expenses prematurely.
21.

As the year end approached in December 2010, Almeida was added to an e-mail

discussion of the short-fall in anticipated Utilities Division revenue, especially for one of the
Division’s principal utility demand-side management programs, its New Jersey Direct Install
(“NJ Direct”) program. Almeida forwarded the NJ Direct discussion to Raina, who responded
that, prior to actually selling jobs to direct install customers, the Division was already creating
purchase orders and sending the purchase orders to vendors that supplied Lime Energy with
materials, so that the Division could quickly get invoices from the vendors to acknowledge that
materials for the jobs had been ordered, in order to allow the Division to recognize revenue on
jobs shortly after the jobs were sold, up to the full percentage of job expenses allocated to
materials.
22.

In fact, Lime Energy did not receive documentation before the 2010 fiscal year end

showing that it had incurred costs on several Utilities Division jobs that customers purportedly
had agreed to near the end of the fiscal year, the Utilities Division, at the direction of Almeida

7

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 8 of 27

and Raina, nevertheless recorded those costs and thus improperly recognized revenue. Utilities
Division employees kept both Raina and Almeida informed regarding jobs for which revenue
had been recognized but which had not been completed, had not been started, or had not been
submitted to the contractor overseeing the NJ Direct program for approval.
23.

On November 8, 2011, Lime filed a current Report on Form 8-K with the

Commission along with a press release indicating the company’s reported revenue for the first
three quarters of 2011 was $75.4 million and that projected revenue for the fourth quarter of
2011 would be $47-53 million, for a 2011 year-end total revenue projection of $122.4-128.4
million.
24.

Shortly before the company’s November 2011 public announcement of its year-to-

date revenue and year-end revenue projection, Smith emailed Chandler, Almeida, Raina, and
other employees in both the Public Sector and Utilities Divisions about the company’s year-end
revenue projection: “pulling the $123mm off will be nothing short of exceptional. That should
be the focus, the main thought, anything less is (YOU FILL IN THE BLANK).”
25.

In early January 2012, Raina asked a Utilities Division bookkeeper to send an email

to Chandler asking whether it was “possible to add more Revenue . . . in Nov so Dec doesn’t
look so heavy – apparently we are going to have to be a little bit more aggressive than originally
thought.” Chandler immediately responded, “Nope. We have already done our entries that are
based off of revenue. We cannot drag our closing any longer. Next month this will not be an
option at all.”
26.

Chandler forwarded Raina’s request to add more revenue to November to Smith,

and informed Smith that November 2011 revenue from the Utilities Division was only $3.5
million. Chandler and Smith ultimately did agree to Raina’s request to re-open the company’s

8

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 9 of 27

books and records for November 2011, because, as Smith stated, there was “[n]o way we can go
out with $3.5mm in November.”
27.

Chandler emailed Raina and the Utilities Division bookkeeper stating that she had

spoken to Smith “and agreed to open Nov back up IF these entries are done today. They need to
be done by the end of the day today. Anything not there will go in December.” Chandler added
that “[t]his cannot happen in Dec. Your drop dead deadline i[s] Jan 20 for Dec entry. You will
need to plan your time accordingly.” Smith said he would “most definitely” support upholding
the deadlines set by Chandler.
28.

Chandler separately emailed Lime’s Chief Financial Officer to inform him that the

company’s November 2011 books would be re-opened, stating that “utilities missed some
projects for Nov close and [Smith] would like to reopen it. I told them it needed to be completed
today.”
29.

After Chandler and Smith agreed to re-open Lime’s November 2011 books and

records, Utilities Division employees emailed the necessary journal entries to Chandler and her
staff for uploading into the company’s financial reporting system, and changed the revenue
recognition percentages in the company’s financial systems so that revenue related to already
existing projects would be recognized earlier than appropriate. This resulted in millions of
dollars in revenue being improperly recorded and recognized in Lime’s November 2011 books
and records.
30.

Also in early January 2012, Smith met with Almeida and Raina to discuss a “year-

end push” regarding 2011 revenue. Almeida and Raina presented Smith with a spreadsheet that
showed the Utilities Division actual and projected revenue for 2011, and later emailed the
spreadsheet to Smith at his request. While the spreadsheet identified a 2011 year-end goal for
the Utilities Division of $50 million, it indicated that no more than $45 million would be

9

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 10 of 27

achieved and only by including in December 2011 revenue millions of dollars from new
contracts that would not be signed by Lime customers until January 2012.
31.

After discussions with Smith, Almeida and Raina instructed Utilities Division

personnel to provide journal entries to Chandler and her staff, so that millions of dollars of
revenue would be recognized by the company in December 2011 on contracts that were not
signed by Lime customers until January 2012.
32.

Almeida and Raina also instructed Utilities Division bookkeepers to increase the

revenue recognition percentages in the company’s financial systems so that revenue related to
already existing projects would be recognized in December 2011, before it was actually earned
by the company in 2012. Utilities Division bookkeepers followed these instructions, which
resulted in Lime recognizing millions of dollars of revenue in 2011 that would not be earned
until 2012.
33.

Utilities Division bookkeepers followed these instructions and emailed the

necessary journal entries to Chandler and her staff for uploading into the company’s financial
reporting system.

Chandler and her staff immediately loaded the journal entries into the

company’s financial reporting system without asking any questions about the propriety of the
revenue being booked. This resulted in Lime recognizing millions of dollars of revenue in 2011
that would not be earned until later in 2012.
34.

Later in January 2012, Almeida, Raina, and another Utilities Division employee

discussed recognizing revenue on so-called “pipeline” projects – that is, projects where contract
proposals had been presented to customers but had not yet been agreed to or signed by those
customers.

Subsequent to these discussions, Raina provided revenue information for these

“pipeline” projects to Utilities Division bookkeepers so that it could be recognized in December

10

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 11 of 27

2011. Almeida and Raina had never before booked revenue related to “pipeline” projects and
knew that it was not properly recognizable as revenue.
35.

In late January 2012 and early February 2012, Raina emailed lists reflecting

millions of dollars of “pipeline” revenue to Utilities Division bookkeepers, who then followed
Raina’s instructions to make and email the necessary journal entries to Chandler and her staff for
uploading into the company’s financial reporting system. Chandler and her staff immediately
loaded the journal entries into the company’s financial reporting system without asking any
questions about the legitimacy of the projects or the propriety of the revenue being booked. This
resulted in millions of dollars of non-existent revenue related to these “pipeline” projects –
including, in some instances, entirely fabricated revenue amounts – being recognized by the
company in its December 2011 revenue.
36.

On Saturday, February 4, 2012, Smith and Chandler received an email from Lime’s

Chief Financial Officer stating that that the company was roughly $500,000 below a $120
million revenue target that Lime’s Chief Executive Officer had recently informed Lime senior
management was the “current and absolute drop dead goal.” The next morning, a Sunday, Smith
emailed Chandler about additional revenue items from Lime’s Public Sector Division: “was
waiting on the final number, have to get to $120 so will have something coming your way.”
37.

Smith shortly thereafter emailed Chandler with three new items of revenue relating

to existing projects that totaled more than $500,000 in Public Sector revenue, which Smith
indicated he was providing because they needed to save the company’s $120 million goal. Smith
stated that the new revenue items related to one invoice that had been missed previously and two
other invoices had not yet been received by the company but should have been, and suggested
that Chandler make the accounting entries herself.

11

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 12 of 27

38.

Within minutes, and without asking any questions about the untimeliness or

propriety of these newly-discovered revenue items, Chandler emailed back that the journal
entries had been made and “revenue is updated…[b]arring any adjustments…the revenue for
2011 is now at $120,220,719.60.” Smith responded, “Ok, we will keep our fingers crossed there
are no adjustment[s]. Get your tap dancing shoes on……….” Smith then emailed Public Sector
employees about the new revenue that had been recognized and instructed them to make the
necessary adjustments to Public Sector forecasts.
39.

Contrary to what Smith emailed to Chandler, these new items of revenue could not

be properly recognized by Lime in its 2011 revenue because they would not be earned by the
company until the work related to these items was completed later in 2012.
40.

On March 16, 2012, Lime filed its 2011 annual Report on Form 10-K with the

Commission, reporting company-wide revenue for the year of $120,083,000; an amount just over
the company’s internal revenue target for that year.
III. SMITH AND CHANDLER FAILED TO FOLLOW INTERNAL
ACCOUNTING CONTROLS AND ALLOWED IMPROPER REVENUE TO
BE RECOGNIZED
41.

Lime’s internal accounting controls, which Chandler provided to Lime’s outside

auditors, established guideline dates by which journal entries and other activities related to
revenue recognition were to be completed following the close of monthly, quarterly, and annual
reporting periods.
42.

As the Corporate Controller for Lime, Chandler had responsibility and control for

opening and closing the company’s financial books and records every month. Chandler failed to
enforce the company’s reporting guidelines and knowingly or recklessly permitted millions of
dollars of revenue to be improperly recognized after those deadlines.

12

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 13 of 27

43.

Lime’s internal accounting controls also required that Chandler and Smith review

and discuss every job completed by the company every month.
44.

Chandler and Smith typically discussed Public Sector projects but not all Utilities

projects, and they did not discuss the revenue items that resulted in the company improperly
recognizing millions of dollars of revenue in 2011 from incomplete jobs.
IV. LIME’S FALSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE USED IN THE OFFER
AND SALE OF $2.55 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK TO ONE OF
LIME’S DIRECTORS
45.

On May 15, 2012, Lime entered into a subscription agreement to sell one million

shares of its common stock to one of its board members at the most recent consolidated closing
bid price of $2.55 on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
46.

Lime offered and sold these securities pursuant to a registration statement dated

September 1, 2011, and a prospectus supplement dated May 15, 2012.
47.

Lime’s May 15, 2012 prospectus supplement incorporated by reference the

company’s 2011 annual report that had been filed with the Commission on March 16, 2012.
48.

Lime received $2,550,000 from its board member in exchange for the one million

shares of common stock.
V.

LIME IDENTIFIES MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF IMPROPER
FRAUDULENT REVENUE AND RESTATES FINANCIAL REPORTS

OR

49.

On July 17, 2012, following a partial internal investigation by Lime’s CFO, Lime

announced that its consolidated annual financial statements in its annual Reports on Form 10-K
for 2010 and 2011 could no longer be relied on because revenue had been recorded improperly,
including some instances where non-existent revenue may have recorded and where revenue may
have been recorded earlier than it should have been.
50.

Subsequent to further investigation, Lime terminated the employment of Almeida,

Raina, Smith, Chandler, and the Utilities Division bookkeeper involved in the improper revenue
13

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 14 of 27

recognition.
51.

On December 27, 2012, as a result of its expanded internal investigation, Lime

announced that its consolidated annual financial statements in its annual Reports on Form 10-K
for the 2008 and 2009 also could no longer be relied on because “some portion of the Company’s
revenue for 2009 and 2008 was recognized earlier than permitted under generally accepted
accounting principles.”
52.

In July 2013, Lime filed restated financial results for the annual reporting periods of

2008-2011, as well as for the first quarter of 2012.
53.

Lime’s July 31, 2013 restatement disclosed that an investigation conducted by

outside counsel and forensic accountants revealed “that certain individuals, including members
of its accounting and operations staff, working together, circumvented its internal controls by
obtaining or modifying documents in a fraudulent manner in order to recognize revenue earlier
than appropriate and in some instances to support revenue that was not associated with valid
customer contracts.”
54.

Lime’s July 31, 2013 restatement further disclosed that “approximately $14.2

million of revenue was recognized where no valid customer contract existed or the amount
recognized exceeded the contract value and $17.4 million of cumulative revenue . . . was
recognized earlier than appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles.”
55.

In making the restatement, Lime determined that the Utilities Division recognized

over $5 million of improper revenue throughout 2010, including more than $4.5 million of
revenue that was recognized earlier than appropriate. Lime also determined that the Utilities
Division recognized over $16 million of improper revenue throughout 2011, including more than
$10.5 million of unsupported or non-existent revenue of which $7.5 million was recognized in
the fourth quarter of 2011. Lime’s restatement of non-existent revenue from its 2011 financial

14

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 15 of 27

results included the millions of dollars of “pipeline” revenue that Almeida and Raina had
instructed Utilities Division bookkeepers to record in Lime’s December 2011 revenue.
56.

In making the restatement, Lime also determined that the Public Sector Division

recognized over $9.5 million of improper revenue in 2010, including more than $9 million of
revenue that was recognized earlier than appropriate. Lime further determined that the Public
Sector Division recognized over $10 million of improper revenue in 2011, including more than
$8 million of revenue that was recognized earlier than appropriate in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Lime’s restatement efforts moved the more than $500,000 of Public Sector revenue that Smith
directed Chandler to include in Lime’s 2011 revenue to its 2012 revenue.
CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
First Claim (LIME)
Violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)]
57.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

58.

At all relevant times, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act provided that “[i]t shall be

unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities . . . by the use of any means or
instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails,
directly or indirectly” to engage in certain fraudulent acts. 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a). Section 17(a)(1)
makes it unlawful to, directly or indirectly, “employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.”
15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1). Section 17(a)(2) makes it unlawful to, directly or indirectly, “obtain
money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.” 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2). Section 17(a)(3) prohibits,
directly or indirectly, “engag[ing] in any transaction, practice, or course of business which

15

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 16 of 27

operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser” in the offer or sale of
securities. 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3).
59.

As described above, certain Lime employees used the means and instrumentalities

of communication in interstate commerce to recognize improperly revenue so that the company
could meet public revenue projections or report higher than accurate results to the public, and
Lime filed financial statements with the Commission reflecting these false financial results. The
improperly recognized revenue was quantitatively and qualitatively material.

These false

financial statements were used by Lime when it offered and sold $2.55 million of common stock
to one of its directors. Through the conduct of its employees, in the offer or sale of securities,
Lime employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, obtained money or property by means of
untrue statements of material fact, and engaged in acts, practices, or courses of business that
operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, thereby violating Section
17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities Act.
Second Claim (LIME)
Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)]
and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]
60.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

61.

At all relevant times, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and

Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] made it unlawful for any person, directly or
indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or
of any facility of any national securities exchange, (a) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice
to defraud, (b) to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, or (c) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which

16

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 17 of 27

operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any persons, in connection with the purchase
or sale of any security.
62.

As described above, certain Lime employees used the means and instrumentalities

of interstate commerce to recognize false revenue so that the company could meet public revenue
projections or report higher than accurate results to the public, and the improperly recognized
revenue was quantitatively and qualitatively material. Lime filed financial statements with the
Commission reflecting these false financial results. Through the conduct of its employees, Lime
employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, made untrue statements of material fact, and
engaged in acts, practices or courses of business that operated or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person, thereby violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act
Rules 10b-5(a), (b), and (c).
Third Claim (SMITH, CHANDLER, ALMEIDA & RAINA)
Violations of the Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)] and
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13b2-1]
63.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

64.

At all relevant times:
a.

Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)] required

issuers, including Lime, to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the issuer;
b.

Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)] made it

unlawful for any person to knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a
system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsify books, records, or
accounts that are described in Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)]; and
17

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 18 of 27

c.

Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1] made it unlawful for

any person to directly or indirectly falsify or cause to be falsified any book, record
or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.
§ 78m(b)(2)].
65.

As described above, Smith, Chandler, Almeida, and Raina falsified or caused to be

falsified books, records, or accounts that are subject to Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, and
therefore violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. § 240.13b2-1].
66.

As described above, Smith, Chandler, Almeida and Raina knowingly falsified

books, records, or accounts that are described in Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, and
therefore violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)].
67.

As described above, Smith and Chandler knowingly circumvented Lime’s system

of internal accounting controls, and therefore violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)]
Fourth Claim (LIME)
Violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)] and
Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13]
68.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

69.

At all relevant times:
a. Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(a)] and Rules 13a-1 and
13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13], required issuers, including Lime,
to file with the Commission Forms 10-K (reporting annual results), and Forms 10-Q
(reporting quarterly results), that truthfully and accurately report on the issuer’s
revenues, earnings, other financial results, information about accounting practices,
and other related information.

18

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 19 of 27

b.

Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A)]

required issuers, including Lime, to make and keep books, records, and accounts,
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.
c. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B)] required
issuers, including Lime, to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: transactions are executed
in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to
such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets; access to assets is
permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization;
and the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
70.

As described above, Lime failed to file truthful and correct annual and quarterly

reports (on Forms 10-K and 10-Q) with the Commission, and failed to include material
information in its required statements and reports as was necessary to make the required
statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
71.

By reason of the foregoing, Lime violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and

13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A), and 78m(b)(2)(B)], and
Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and l3a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13].

19

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 20 of 27

Fifth Claim (SMITH, ALMEIDA & CHANDLER)
Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)]
and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a) and (c)]
72.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

73.

At all relevant times, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and

Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] made it unlawful for any person, directly or
indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of
any facility of any national securities exchange, (a) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to
defraud, (b) to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, or (c) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which
operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any persons, in connection with the purchase
or sale of any security.
74.

As described above, Smith and Almeida knowingly or recklessly recognized

millions of dollars of improper revenue so that the company could meet public revenue projections
or report higher than accurate results to the public. During the relevant time period, Chandler
failed to follow Lime’s internal accounting controls to ensure revenue was properly recorded and
recklessly participated in the improper recognition of revenue by both the Utilities and Public
Sector divisions.
75.

As described above, Smith, Almeida, and Chandler used and directed the means

and instrumentalities of interstate commerce be used to recognize false or improper revenue that
was both quantitatively and qualitatively material.
76.

Through their conduct, Smith, Almeida, and Chandler knowingly or recklessly

employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud and engaged in acts, practices, or courses of

20

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 21 of 27

business that operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, thereby violating
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a) and (c).
Sixth Claim (SMITH, ALMEIDA & CHANDLER)
Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933
[15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)(1), and 77q(a)(3)]
77.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

78.

At all relevant times, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act provided that “it shall be

unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities . . . by the use of any means or
instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails,
directly or indirectly “to engage in certain fraudulent acts. 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a). Section 17(a)(1)
makes it unlawful to, directly or indirectly, “employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.”
15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1).

Section 17(a)(3) prohibits, directly or indirectly, “engag[ing] in any

transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon the purchaser” in the offer or sale of securities. 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3).
79.

As described above, Smith and Almeida knowingly or recklessly recognized

millions of dollars of improper revenue so that Lime could meet public revenue projections or
report higher than accurate results to the public. During the relevant time period, Chandler failed
to follow Lime’s internal accounting controls to ensure revenue was properly recorded and
recklessly participated in the improper recognition of revenue by both the Utilities and Public
Sector divisions.
80.

As described above, Smith, Almeida, and Chandler used and directed the means

and instrumentalities of interstate commerce be used to recognize false or improper revenue, and
the improperly recognized revenue was both quantitatively and qualitatively material.
81.

Through their conduct, Smith, Almeida, and Chandler knowingly or recklessly

employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud and engaged in acts, practices, or courses of
21

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 22 of 27

business that operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a person, thereby violating
Section 17(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Securities Act.
Seventh Claim (RAINA)
Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933
[15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3)]
82.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

83.

At all relevant times, Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act provided that “it shall

be unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities . . . directly or indirectly . . . to
engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a
fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.” 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(3).
84.

As described above, Raina, often in coordination with Almeida and Smith, directed

the improper recognition of millions of dollars of revenue that he knew, or should have known,
had not been earned by Lime and, in some instances, directed that revenue be recorded even
though he knew or should have known that it did not and would never exist, so that Lime could
meet public revenue projections or report higher than accurate results to the public. Raina directed
that the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce be used to improperly recognize
revenue. The improperly recognized revenue was quantitatively and qualitatively material.
Through his conduct, Raina engaged in transactions, practices or courses of business that operated
or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a person, thereby violating Section 17(a)(3) of the
Securities Act.
Eighth Claim (SMITH, ALMEIDA & CHANDLER)
Aiding and Abetting Lime’s Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §
78(j)] and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(b) [17 C.F.R.240.10b-5(b)]
85.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated by reference.

86.

At all relevant times, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and

22

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 23 of 27

Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(b) [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)] made it unlawful for any person, directly
or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or
of any facility of any national securities exchange, to make any untrue statement of a material fact
or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
87.

As described above, Lime made untrue statements of material fact when it filed its

reports on Forms 10-Q and Forms 10-K with the Commission that included financial statements
that contained both early and non-existent revenue.
88.

By reason of the foregoing, Lime violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15

U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5(b) [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)] thereunder.
89.

By reason of the conduct described above, Smith, Chandler, and Almeida

knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to, and thereby aided and abetted, Lime’s
violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Exchange Act Rule 10b5(b) [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)].
90.

Accordingly, Smith, Chandler and Almeida are liable under Section 20(e) of the

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)] for aiding and abetting Lime’s violations.
Ninth Claim (SMITH, ALMEIDA & CHANDLER)
Aiding and Abetting Lime’s Violations of Section 17(a)(2)
of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)]
91.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated by reference.

92.

At all relevant time, Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) [15 U.S.C. 77q(a)(2)] made it

unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any securities, by any means or instruments of
transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or by use of the mails, directly or
indirectly, to obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of material fact or any

23

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 24 of 27

omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
93.

As described above, certain Lime employees used the means and instrumentalities

of interstate commerce to recognize false or improper revenue so that the company could meet
public revenue projections or report higher than accurate results to the public, and Lime filed
financial statements with the Commission reflecting these false financial results. The improperly
recognized revenue was quantitatively and qualitatively material. These false financial statements
were used by Lime when it offered and sold $2.55 million of common stock to one of its directors.
Through the conduct of its employees, in the offer or sale of securities, Lime obtained money or
property by means of untrue statements of material fact, thereby violating Section 17(a)(2) of the
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2)].
94.

By reason of the conduct described above, Smith, Chandler, and Almeida

knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to, and thereby aided and abetted, Lime’s
violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 77(q)(a)(2)].
95.

Accordingly, Smith, Chandler, and Almeida are liable under Section 15(b) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77(b)] for aiding and abetting Lime’s violations.
Tenth Claim (SMITH, CHANDLER, ALMEIDA, & RAINA)
Aiding and Abetting Lime’s Violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A)
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a) and 78m(b)(2)] and Exchange Act
Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13]
96.

Paragraphs 1 through 56 are realleged and incorporated by reference.

97.

At all relevant times,
d.

Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(a)] and Exchange

Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13], required
issuers, including Lime, to file with the Commission Forms 10-K (reporting annual

24

Case 1:16-cv-08088 Document 1 Filed 10/17/16 Page 25 of 27

results) and Forms 10-Q (reporting quarterly results), that truthfully and accurately
reported on Lime’s revenues, earnings, other financial results, information about
accounting practices, and other related information;
e. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)] required
issuers, including Lime, to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the issuer.
98.

As described above, Lime failed to file truthful and correct annual and quarterly

reports (on Forms 10-K and 10-Q) with the Commission, and failed to include material
information in its required statements and reports as was necessary to make the required
statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
99.

By reason of the foregoing, Lime violated Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a) and 78m(b)(2)(A)] and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and l3a-13
[17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13].
100.

By reason of the conduct described above, Smith, Chandler, Almeida, and Raina,

acting knowingly or recklessly, provided substantial assistance to and thereby aided and abetted
Lime in its violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a)
and 78m(b)(2)(A)] and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1 and
240.13a-13].
101.

Accordingly, Smith, Chandler, Almeida, and Raina are liable, pursuant to Section

20(e) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78t(e)], for aiding and abetting Lime’s violations.
