________________________: 

On February 15, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”)
published a proposed Distribution Plan and issued a Notice of Proposed Distribution Plan
and Opportunity for Comment (Exchange Act Release No. 57341), in connection with
this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103. No comments were received and on April 9,
2008, the Commission approved the proposed Distribution Plan, appointed Nelson S.
Kibler as the Fund Administrator and waived the bond requirement for the Fund
Administrator for good cause shown in the Distribution Plan (Exchange Act Release No.
57639).
The Distribution Plan provides that a Fair Fund consisting of the $30 million in
disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties paid by American Express
Financial Advisors Inc. (now known as Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc.)
(“Ameriprise”), plus accrued interest and less any amounts necessary to pay taxes and a
$100,000 dispute reserve, be transferred to U.S. Bank to be distributed by the Fund
Administrator to current and former customers of Ameriprise according to the
methodology set forth in the Distribution Plan. Of the $30 million paid by Ameriprise,
$3,239,000 constitutes prejudgment interest.
The Plan further provides that the Commission will arrange for distribution of the
Fair Fund after it receives and accepts from the Fund Administrator a validated payment
list setting forth the names of and the amounts to be distributed to all persons receiving
payments under the Distribution Plan. The validated payment list providing for the
distribution of $31,771,009, which includes the principal and interest accumulated as of
May 31, 2008, has been received and accepted.

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer
$31,771,009.00 of the Fair Fund to U.S. Bank and the Fund Administrator shall distribute
such monies to investors in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Plan.

For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Florence E. Harmon
Acting Secretary
