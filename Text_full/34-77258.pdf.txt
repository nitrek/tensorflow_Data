Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and
Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
This matter involves insider trading by Lawrence M. Gincel in the
securities of GSI Commerce, Inc. (“GSI”) in advance of the March 28, 2011
announcement that eBay, Inc. (“EBAY”) had agreed to acquire GSI.
2.
In the months prior to the March 28, 2011 announcement, Patricia Metzler
(“Patricia”) misappropriated information about the acquisition of GSI from her friend,
Individual A, who was married to a GSI employee at the time. Individual A provided
Patricia with material nonpublic information in the context of their relationship of trust
and confidence.
3.
Patricia then tipped her good friend, Gincel about the upcoming
acquisition of GSI. Gincel traded on the basis of the information and garnered trading
profits of $1,083.
4.
By virtue of this conduct, Respondent violated Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Facts
9.
Individual A first learned of the possible acquisition of GSI by EBAY
from Individual A’s spouse, a GSI employee who possessed material nonpublic
information concerning GSI’s operations and management, on or about January 30, 2011.
Individual A knew that the information about the possible acquisition of GSI by EBAY
was material and nonpublic, and that Individual A had an obligation to maintain the
confidentiality of the information.
10.
Individual A and Patricia have a long-standing relationship of trust and
confidence built on years of sharing personal and professional confidences about their
lives which they understood were to be maintained confidentially. Patricia had also been
friends with Individual A’s husband for many years prior to 2011 and knew of GSI.
11.
During conversations on or around February 21, 2011, Individual A told
Patricia in confidence about the upcoming acquisition of GSI. Patricia understood as
Individual A’s friend that the information she received from Individual A was
confidential.
12.
Following her conversations with Individual A, Patricia shared the
material nonpublic information regarding the upcoming GSI acquisition, and the fact that
she had learned that information from Individual A, with her good friend, Gincel. Patricia
intentionally tipped that information to Gincel and obtained a personal benefit. Gincel
knew that this information was material and nonpublic and knew, or should have known,
that it had been disclosed in breach of a duty.
13.
On March 15, 2011, Gincel purchased 100 shares of GSI in his brokerage
account on the basis of the material nonpublic information about the acquisition that
Patricia had communicated to him.
14.
At 10:05 a.m. on March 28, 2011, GSI and EBAY announced that the
companies had entered into a definitive agreement to merge, whereby EBAY would
acquire GSI for $29.25 per share. The closing last sale price of GSI on the day of the
announcement was $29.20, an increase of approximately 50.6% over the prior day’s
close.
15.
Gincel allowed his GSI shares to convert to cash at the close of the deal on
June 21, 2011 for a profit of $1,083.
16.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent violated Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct
in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

3

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the
sanctions agreed to in Respondent Gincel’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.
Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent Gincel cease and
desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
B.
Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay
disgorgement of $1,083, prejudgment interest of $159, and a civil money penalty in the
amount of $1,083 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general
fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely
payment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest is not made, additional interest shall
accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600. If timely payment of the civil penalty is not
made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717. Payment must be made
in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the
Commission, which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire
instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via
Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

(3)

Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or
United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities
and Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Lawrence M. Gincel as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these
proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Scott
Friestad, Associate Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F St., NE, Washington, DC 20549-5010.
C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order
shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax
4

purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in
any Related Investor Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by,
offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of
Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in
any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall,
within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the
Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional
civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in
this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true
and admitted by Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment,
order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this
proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondent of the federal securities laws or any
regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
