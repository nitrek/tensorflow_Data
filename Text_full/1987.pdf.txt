The Honorable George Bush

Gentlemen:
It is an honor to transmit the Fifty-Third Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for the fiscal year ended September 30. 1987.
The 1987 fiscal year was somewhat unusual because three different people chaired the
Commission during the year. Former Chairman John Shad concluded his long and distinguished service at the Commission on June 18, 1987. Commissioner Charles C. Cox
served admirably as Acting Chairman until I became Chairman on August 7, 1987.
During fiscal year 1987, the excellent work of the staff enabled the Commission to fulfill its
statutory mission while meeting new challenges, in the headquarters and regional offices.
Increased budgetary resources, requested from Congress for upcoming fiscal years,
would enhance the Commission's ability to continue this high level of performance.
Statutory responsibilities of the Commission include enforcing the federal securities laws,
ensuring complete and accurate disclosure regarding the issuer and its securities, overseeing stock exchanges and secondary market participants, regulating investment companies and investment advisers and engaging in appellate and other litigation. The Commission again successfully discharged these responsibilities dUring the fiscal year.

Enforcement: During the fiscal year, the Commission's enforcement program continued to be vigorous and comprehensive. Primary program areas are fraudulent securities
offerings, violations of the securities laws by broker-dealers and other regulated entities, insider trading, and issuer financial disclosure. A total of 303 cases were brought during the
year. The Commission obtained court orders requiring defendants to retum illicit profits
amounting to approximately $121 million. Disgorgement in insider trading cases alone
amounted to $70.1 million, and civil penalties under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act
amounted to $62.6 million.
Some of the most significant insider trading cases in the Commission's history were
brought during the fiscal year. On November 14, 1986, the Commission instituted and settled a civil action against Ivan F. Boesky, an arbitrageur. As part of Boesky's settlement, he
agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officials in continuing inquiries. The cooperation was significant in the Commission's strategic approach to law enforcement

Full Disdosure: The full disclosure program is designed to provide investors with full
and accurate material information, foster investor confidence, contribute to fair and orderly markets, facilitate capital formation, and inhibit fraud. Ongoing activities and special
projects were carried out to accomplish the goals of the program.
Full reviews of disclosure filings increased during the fiscal year. Resources were devoted
to new issuers, tender offer fIlings, and to annual meeting proxies. The latter category included over 2,000 proxies requesting shareholder approval for reducing director liabilities
and broadening indemnification of corporate officers and directors as a result of new state
corporate laws. New issues of securities and corporate acquisitions and restructurings
were at high levels during the year.
Passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 required substantial staff resources for filings made
to assure certain tax consequences. Innovative securities, such as private and public collateralized loan obligations, continued to proliferate. Also during the year, the Commission
took action on a wide range of issues in rulemakmg, interpretive, and legislative matters.
Additionally staff prepared a chapter in the intemationalization report

and AucUting Matters: During the fiscal year, the Commission
adopted rules that improve and simplify disclosures made by bank holding companies
about loans to countries experiencing liquidity problems. It also amended its rules to delete certain requirements regarding disclosure of effects of inflation and changing prices.
The Commission also issued proposed rules regarding peer review and increased disclosure of disagreements between accountants and clients. The staff also studied the draft
proposals of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting.
Accouatlng

EDGAR: The Commission's pilot electronic disclosure system (known as "EDGAR" for
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval) successfully completed its third full year
of operation, demonstrating the feasibility of electronic flUng and review. Over 20,000 filings have been made since the pilot program began in September 1984. Filers include
publicly-traded corporations, investment companies, and public utility holding companies. During the fiscal year, the Commission moved ahead with plans for an operational
system and the Request for Proposals, amended to reflect changes in the funding strategy,
was released on October 23, 1987. The Office of Edgar Management was created to direct
the procurement and implementation of the EDGAR operational contract

Regu1atlon of the Securities Malkeu: During the fiscal year, on-going programs
for oversight of the nation's securities markets and of market professionals were carried
out, and progress was made on new challenges presented by the markets.
Oversight examinations of broker-dealers were enhanced with the addition of on-line
computer systems to Improve collection of data and with development of software programs for use in field examinations. The staff increased the emphasis placed on review of
sales practices during the year in inspections of broker-dealers and of self-regulatory organizations. Also during the year, 500 new over-the-counter securities were designated as
National Market System securities, and unlisted trading privileges were granted for 25
NMS securities to be traded on the Midwest Stock Exchange. In the area of clearance and
settlement of securities, progress was made during the year. Specifically, mortgagebacked securities transactions settling in sameday funds, and mutual fund orders were
added to the National Clearance and Settlement System, and immobilization of securities
was encouraged during the year.
Issues associated with internationalization of the securities markets remained a high priority. The Commission approved certain linkages between exchanges and clearing agencies
and granted certain exemptions to accommodate foreign market structures. The Commission held a roundtable discussion on internationalization issues associated with primary and secondary markets. These issues were also discussed in the Staff Report on Internationalization.
Market volatility remained a concern of the Commission throughout the fiscal year. The
Commission took steps, in cooperation with the exchanges, to reduce volatility on socalled Expiration Fridays, and study of the results continued. Also during the fiscal year,
the staff completed and published an intensive review and analysis of market events of
September 11 and 12, 1987. Although that study did not find that immediate regulatory action was necessary, it expressed concern over a "cascade" scenario of certain sudden effects in the securities markets because of the close interplay and increased use of derivative products for index arbitrage and portfolio insurance.

Economic Research and Analysis: The economic staff provides the Commission
with economic advice and analysis regarding rule proposals, policy matters, and the capital markets. It also engages in statistical monitoring of the securities industry. During the
year, the staff reviewed 110 rules and rule proposals. It also provided advice to operating divisions regarding the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, reviewing 65 Regulatory Flexibility analyses and certifications. A major initiative during the year was the Staff
Report on Internationalization. Also, staff prepared studies concerning: the effects of multiple trading of options; the use of repurchase agreements; trading and returns behavior of
initial public offerings; alternative criteria for subjecting of issuers to the mandatory disclosure requirements; and effects of full cost accounting on oil and gas firms. Additionally, the
staff prepared several studies regarding changes in corporate control. These included tender offer financing; dual-class recapitalizations; effects of defeating takeover attempts;
market anticipation of takeovers; and the effects of the Ohio anti-takeover law. Other analyses were performed during the year regarding various aspects of mutual funds.
Utlgatlon and Legal Activities: The Office of the General Counsel represented the
Commission in 304 litigation matters. During the fiscal year, 36 federal court of appeals
and Supreme Court cases were concluded, all but three favorably to the Commission. Of
16 appeals in Commission injunctive actions, six were concluded, with only one outcome

3

unfavorable to the CommiSsion.
seeking to overturn Commission

There were also 23 appellate and district court actions
orders. Ten were concluded, with one adverse result

Also during the year, the Commission participated as amicus curiae in 46 cases, and entered its appearance in 32 of 94 reorganizations under Chapter 11. The General Counsel
handled more than 217 other proceedings before the Commission or in the federal district
courts, assisted the Commission in preparation of testimony on a number of important issues and on a legislative proposal to amend the Exchange Act to permit the Commission
to regulate certain brokerage activities of banks. The General Counsel also assisted in
preparation of the Staff Report on Internationalization.

Investment Companies and Advisers: The number of investment companies,

investment advisers, and assets managed by them increased substantially during the fiscal
year, while staff levels in the Division of Investment Management remained essentially unchanged. For the first time, the number of examinations completed by regional and headquarters staff during the fiscal year exceeded 2,000, almost double the number completed
five years ago. Both regional and headquarters
staff continued efforts to coordinate with
state regulators by conducting joint examinations, providing training for state examiners,
and routinely sharing examination results. Also during the year, substantial progress was
made on a report requested by Congress regarding the financial planners industry. Among
the areas discussed in the report is the National Association of Securities Dealers' pilot project to inspect investment advisers who are also NASD members.
Other initiatives undertaken by the staff durinq the year included work on legislative proposals, on the Staff Study on Intemationalization,
rulemaking and disclosure and administration of the Public Utility Holding Company Act

Management and Program Support: During the fiscal year, management

staff initiated 24 major projects, including reviews of information security and intemal controlobjectives. Consistent with prudent management,
intemal audits were conducted of programs, activities and functions. Consumer affairs specialists responded to approximately
40,000 complaints and inquiries during the fiscal year, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. During fiscal year 1987, 1,908 Freedom of Information Act requests were processed, and 2,005 Congressional requests for records were fulfilled, Programs in support
of Equal Employment Opportunity were carried out during the year, as were programs designed to enhance computerization.
Also during the year, training programs emphasized
computer literacy, leadership subjects related to equal employment opportunity, and other
significant areas.

Also during the year, the Commission testified before Congress 19 times regarding issues
such as tender offers, insider trading, oversight and surveillance of the securities markets,
federal government loan sales, the role of auditors in financial reporting, and the Commission's authorization and appropriation.

Enforcement Program

Key 1987 Results
The Commission's 1987 enforcement program was both vigorous and comprehensive in nature. While the largest program areas continued to involve fraudulent
securities offerings and violations by broker-dealers and other regulated entities,
the Commission also brought record numbers of cases involving insider trading
and issuer financial disclosure, areas which have received continuing emphasis.
The Commission brought a total of 303 cases in fiscal year 1987. In fiscal 1986, it
brought 312.

In fiscal year 1987, the Commission obtained court orders requiring defendants
to return illicit profits amounting to approximately $121 million, either as disgorgement or as restitution to defrauded investors or entities. Disgorgement orders in insider trading cases amounted to $70.1 million, compared to $29.7 million in 1986.
Civil penalties under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 (ITSA) amounted to
$62.6 million.
The Commission referred matters, or granted access to its files, to the federal
and state prosecutorial authorities in 150 cases. There were 72 criminal indictments or informations and 87 convictions obtained during fiscal year 1987 in
Commission-related cases.

Introduction
The Commission's enforcement program seeks to preserve the integrity, efficiency and fairness of the securities markets by enforcing the federal securities
laws. These laws provide civil and administrative remedies designed to rectify past
violations and prevent future violations.
Most Commission enforcement actions are preceded by a private investigation
to determine whether a violation of the securities laws has occurred or is about to
occur. Where necessary, the Commission may order a formal investigation and
thereby authorize the staff to issue subpoenas compelling testimony and the production of documents.
Depending on the results of an investigation, the Commission may authorize the
staff to commence a civil action in a United States District Court, institute an
administrative proceeding, or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for

6

criminal prosecution. Matters may also be referred to state or local authorities or
self-regulatory
organizations for appropriate action.
The Commission's
primary civil remedy is a federal court injunction which directs the subject

to comply

with the law in the future. If an injunction

is violated,

contempt of court proceedings
may result in imprisonment
or the imposition of
fines. Courts may also issue orders providing other equitable relief such as restitution, disgorgement
of illicit profits, and other appropriate remedies. Those who
commit insider trading violations may be subject to a penalty not to exceed three
times the profit gained or loss avoided.
The Commission
is authorized to bring administrative
proceedings against regulated entities such as broker-dealers,
investment companies, and investment advisers, as well as persons associated with such entities. Where the Commission
finds that a regulated entity has willfully violated the securities laws, it may impose
remedial sanctions ranging from a censure to revocation of the registration required for the entity to conduct business. The Commission
also may censure or
limit the activities of associated persons, or suspend or bar such persons from association.
Issuers of securities are subject to administrative
proceedings if they fail to comply with the disclosure, proxy and tender offer provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Individuals causing such failures may also be
named as respondents
in such proceedings.
Respondents
may be ordered to
comply with applicable provisions of the securities laws upon specified terms and
conditions, or to take steps to effect compliance.
Issuers may also be named as respondents in certain proceedings authorized by
the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). In addition, the Commission
may publish reports of investigation under Section 21 (a) of the Exchange Act.
Criminal sanctions for federal securities law violations include fines and imprisonment for up to five years for each violation. The Commission
has developed
close working relationships with the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys' Offices to assist in the investigation and prosecution of such cases. The Commission
also cooperates closely with state securities regulators and self-regulatory
organizations, including the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the
various national securities exchanges.

Program Areas
The Commission
investigates and brings enforcement
actions to remedy a
broad range of violations. Classified by primary violation, enforcement activity during fiscal year 1987 included (1) cases concerning
corporate reporting and accounting, (2) insider trading, (3) violations by regulated entities and associated persons, (4) market manipulation,
(5) securities offerings, (6) changes in corporate
control, (7) related party transactions,
(8) fraud against regulated entities, (9) civil
and criminal contempt actions, and (10) delinquent filing cases against both issuers and individuals. (See Table 33 for a listing of all enforcement actions instituted
in fiscal year 1987).

Corporate Reporting and AccountingFinancial disclosure cases continued to
be a high priority in fiscal year 1987. The Commission
brought 61 cases containing

7

significant allegations of financial disclosure violations against issuers, regulated
entities or their employees (including 18 actions in which financial disclosure violations were alleged in addition to other primary violations), compared with 35
such cases in 1986.1 The Commission also brought 11 cases alleging misconduct
on the part of accounting firms or their partners or employees in fiscal year 1987,
including two of the issuer disclosure cases set forth above.2 There were 15 enforcement actions against accountants or accounting firms in 1986.
Typical financial disclosure cases involve the improper valuation of assets or
liabilities; the improper recognition of revenue or income; the failure to establish
sufficient provisions for bad debts or other contingencies; or the failure to provide
adequate disclosure conceming the issuer's financial condition. Many cases also
involve violations of the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act Financial disclosure cases are often complex and require more resources than
other types of cases, but their effective prosecution is essential to preserving the integrity of the disclosure system.
The Commission brought several enforcement actions this fiscal year conceming the adequacy of financial disclosures made by financial institutions. On September 21, 1987, the Commission instituted an injunctive proceeding, SEC v. FinanciaL Corporation of America (FCA),3 in which it alleged that the holding
company for a major savings and loan institution violated the reporting, books and
records, and intemal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleged, among other things, that FCA improperly and prematurely recognized income from certain real estate transactions, referred to as "buy/sell" transactions, which were designed to conceal FCA's involvement in the transactions
and its continuing financial exposure relative to the underlying real estate, causing
improper recognition of income of approximately $13.3 million in one year, and $7
million in the next. The Commission also alleged that FCA failed to maintain adequate reserves to cover losses in its loan and real estate portfolio, due to, among
other things, a decline in underwriting standards that led to an increased volume of
substandard loan assets. It also alleged that FCA improperly recognized income
from certain acquisition, development and construction loans. FCA consented to
the entry of a permanent injunction and to certain reviews, to be performed by its
independent accountants.
On February 27, 1987, the Commission instituted an administrative proceeding,
In the Matter of ContinentaL illinois Corporation." against the holding company
of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, one of the largest
banks in the United States. The Commission alleged that Continental mischaracterized a substantial portion of the loan loss provision reported in its Form 1O-Q for
the second quarter of 1984.
Continental characterized $425 million of the nearly $1 billion provision as "loss
on sale of loans subject to FDIC agreement" Continental did not disclose, however, that the Office of the Comptroller had directed a $950 million provision for
Continental to provide for credit losses in Continental's portfolio prior to the loan
sale. The Commission determined that it was materially misleading for Continental
to attribute the $425 million, which was clearly part of the $950 million provision,
to the event of the sale. Continental consented to a Commission order directing it,
among other things, to comply with various provisions of the Exchange Act, and to
8

restate its financial statements to properly characterize the $425 million provision.
On August 17, 1987, the Commission instituted an administrative proceeding,
In the Matter of Texas Commerce Bencsheres; Inc. (TCB),5 in which it found that
TCB,a bank holding company, failed to have in place an adequate loan loss review
system, and that as a result, the consolidated loan loss reserve for TCB, as of December 31, 1984, was understated by $28.2 million.
The Commission pointed out four factors which played key roles in creating the
system's inadequacy: (1) substantial growth in TCB's aggregate loan portfolio
through the relevant period; (2) TCB's failure to adapt its loan review system to the
increased loan level; (3) TCB's failure to give sufficient emphasis to an ongoing assessment of the loan portfolio; and (4) TCB's reliance on loan officers (rather than
on a separate loan review function) to identify problem loans on a continuing basis.
TCB consented to the issuance of an order requiring itto comply withthe reporting, books and records, and intemal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, and
to comply with certain undertakings.
On August 10, 1987, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings, In
the Matter of DeLa.urentiis Entertainment Group, Inc. (DEG),6 in which it found
that DEG, a company engaged in the financing, production and distribution of
motion pictures, violated the books and records and internal control provisions of
the Exchange Act. The Commission found that DEG incorrectly capitalized approximately $1.5 million in interest costs that should have been expensed, and at
the same time expensed an approximately equivalent amount of selling, general
and administrative costs, and other costs, which should have been capitalized as
production costs.
Italso found that DEG's books and records and system of internal controls failed
to adequately reflect such transactions, and led to the serious compromise of the
accuracy of DEG's financial statements. DEG consented to the Commission's
order which required it to comply with the books and records and internal control
provisions of the Exchange Act and to comply with its undertakings to put in place
certain remedial procedures.
Included in Commission enforcement actions against independent accountants
who examine and issue opinions on an issuer's fmancial statements is SEC v.
Grant Thornton, et al.,7 an injunctive action which was flied on October 16, 1986.
The Commission alleged that Grant Thornton (formerly Alexander Grant & Co.) violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the
issuance of audit reports based on its examination of the financial statements of
ESM Government Securities, Inc. (ESM), a broker-dealer principally engaged in
government securities repurchase transactions. The Commission alleged that the
audits were not conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GMS), and that the financial statements were not prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GMP).
The Commission alleged that many of the audit deficiencies stemmed from
Grant Thornton's failure to understand the nature of the business of ESM. The
complaint also alleged one of the individual defendants, a partner at the firm, became aware that Jose L Gomez, the partner with primary responsibility for ESM,
had taken money from ESM principals. thereby compromising his independence.
The defendants consented to the entry of permanent injunctions.
9

On March 25, 1987, the Commission brought an administrative proceeding,
pursuant to Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice, against KMG Main Hurdman," a firm
of certified public accountants, alleging that Main Hurdman engaged in improper
professional conduct in connection with the audits of the First National Bank of
Midland, Texas (FNBM), and of Time Energy Systems, Inc. In the case of FNBM,
the Commission alleged that a sale and leaseback of the bank's principal properties was not recorded in accordance with GMP and was structured to allow the reporting of a profit in 1982. The Time Energy financial statements allegedly violated
GMP by prematurely recording incentive and management fees from research
and development contracts entered into with various limited partnerships with
which it conducted business.
Main Hurdman consented to the entry of a Commission order in which it was
censured and ordered to comply with certain undertakings, including undergoing
an augmented peer review and documenting certain internal consultations on auditing questions.
The Commission brought five cases primarily involving the misrepresentation
of or failure to disclose information conceming related party transactions, the
compensation of officers, or other matters during fiscal year 1987. The Commission also brought 23 delinquent filing actions during the fiscal year, compared with
18 in 1986.
Insider Trading-Insider trading refers generally to the act of purchasing or selling
securities in breach of a fiduciary duty or a relationship of trust or confidence, while
in possession of material nonpublic information about an issuer or the trading
market for an issuer's securities. The federal securities laws prohibit such trading
not only by corporate officers and directors and other persons having a relationship of trust or confidence with the issuer or its shareholders, but also by persons
who misappropriate material non public information from sources other than the
issuer. The tippees of any such person may also be subject to the prohibition.
The Commission's insider trading enforcement program achieved record results in fiscal year 1987. The Commission brought 36 cases in which insider trading was the primary violation alleged, including several of the most significant insider trading cases ever brought by the Commission. Insider trading violations
were also alleged in an additional six cases, which were primarily financial disclosure cases,"
On November 14, 1986, the Commission instituted the largest insider trading
case in its history against arbitrageur Ivan F. Boesky. 10 The Commission alleged
that Boesky caused certain affiliated entities to trade in securities while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning tender offers, mergers, and
other extraordinary corporate transactions. Boesky was alleged to have obtained
this information from investment banker Dennis B. Levine, who previously had
been enjoined in a Commission action brought in May 1986.
As part of a settlement of that action, Boesky consented to the entry of an order
of permanent injunction. He paid $50 million in cash as disgorgement of profits
obtained by his affiliated entities as a result of the illegal insider trading, and paid
a penalty consisting of securities which had an estimated aggregate value of $50
million. Boesky also consented to the entry of an administrative order permanently

10

barring him from the securities industry. 11Additionally he pleaded guilty to a federal felony charge of conspiracy to make false filings withthe Commission. Boesky
thereafter cooperated with the Commission in its continuing investigation, which
resulted in several additional significant cases during fiscal year 1987.
On February 13, 1987, in SEC v. MartinA. SiegeL,12the Commission filed an injunctive action against an investment banker, alleging that he disclosed to Boesky
material nonpublic information which he obtained by virtue of his employment
Siegel allegedly disclosed the information to Boesky under circumstances in
which Siegel knew that Boesky would cause certain affiliated entities to trade while
in possession of the information. Siegel allegedly received approximately
$700,000 from Boesky in return for the information.
Siegel consented to the entry of a permanent injunction and agreed to disgorge
cash or cash equivalents in the amount of approximately $4.25 million. Siegel also
agreed to disgorge his ownership interest in securities of the investment banking
firm which employed him at the time of the action and in partnerships sponsored
by that firm or its subsidiaries. Siegel also consented to the entry of an order barring him from the securities industry.P and pleaded guilty to two felony charges
arising out of insider trading violations.
On June 4, 1987, the Commission instituted an injunctive action against Kidder
Peabody & Co., Inc.,14alleging that it traded securities while in possession of material nonpublic information. The information was allegedly disclosed to Kidder
through Siegel, who was then a senior mergers and acquisitions professional at
Kidder, by an arbitrageur at an investment bank.
At the time, Siegel was also involved in risk arbitrage activities at Kidder. The
Commission alleged that the Kidder risk arbitrage account purchased and sold securities and options based on information provided relating to tender offers, mergers, leveraged buyouts and other business combinations or extraordinary corporate transactions.
The complaint also alleged, as a separate matter, that Kidder illegally "parked"
securities on behalf of entities controlled by Boesky, by holding securities transferred from Seemala Corporation, a broker-dealer controlled by Boesky, subject to
an agreement that Seemala would repurchase the securities shortly thereafter, and
would bear responsibility for all profits and losses from the transactions. Such
transfers, among others, enabled Seemala to conceal its inability to maintain the
minimum net capital required of broker-dealers by the Commission.
Kidder consented to an injunction and was ordered to pay a total of
$25,294,775. Total disgorgement
equaled $13,676,101. The remaining
$11,618,674 represented a double ITSA penalty.
In a separate administrative proceedmq.l" the Commission censured Kidder
and ordered the firm to comply with its undertakings to retain a consultant to review its policies and procedures. Kidder further consented not to resume previously terminated risk arbitrage trading activities before adopting the procedures
recommended by the consultant and special compliance procedures pertaining to
risk arbitrage trading. Kidder also agreed to cooperate with the Commission's continuing investigation of these matters.
The Commission's continuing investigation has also led to the filing of several
cases involving securities law violations other than insider trading. In SEC v. Boyd
11

L Jefferies, et el; 16 for example, the Commission alleged that the defendants violated the securities laws by engaging in market manipulation and in the the "parking" of securities.
Among other things, the Commission's complaint alleged that Boyd L Jefferies,
then owner of Jefferies & Co., a broker-dealer, entered into an agreement with
Boesky to "park" stock on behalf of Seemala Corporation. The Commission further alleged that securities parked at Jefferies & Co. dropped substantially in value,
leaving Jefferies & Co. with an approximate $3.6 million loss when it "sold" the securities back to Seemala. Boesky then paid Jefferies & Co. $3 million pursuant to
a false invoice created by Jefferies & Co. for purported "investment advisory and
corporate financial services" rendered. The complaint also alleged that Jefferies &
Co. parked its own securities at various Boesky entities, including Seem ala, under
a similar arrangement
Each of the defendants consented to the entry of a permanent injunction and agreed to cooperate with the Commission in its continuing
investigation.
In a related administrative proceeding, 17Jefferies consented to an order barring
him from the securities industry, with a proviso that Jefferies may apply for re-entry
into the securities industry after the greater of five years or the period of any penalty
imposed on him in connection with criminal proceedings. Jefferies & Co. agreed
to a censure and was ordered by the Commission to comply with its undertakings
to, among other things, retain an outside consultant and implement recommendations made by that consultant conceming policies and procedures designed to
prevent future violations of the securities laws. On April 15, 1987, Jefferies pleaded
guilty to two felony charges arising out of the activities which led to the Commission's actions.
In fiscal year 1987, the Commission also brought a number of significant insider
trading cases which were not related to the Levine and Boesky investigations.
On December 10, 1986, the Commission filed an action against Michael N.
David,18 formerly an associate with a law firm, alleging that he misappropriated
material nonpublic information from the law firm conceming proposed or considered corporate takeovers. David allegedly conveyed the information to persons
who traded in the securities of the takeover targets for their own accounts or for an
account in which David had a beneficial interest Those persons also allegedly
conveyed the information to others who also traded in the securities of the takeover
targets. David consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations, and agreed to disgorge $50,000 and pay a cMI penalty not to exceed
$100,000.
The Commission's investigation of the insider trading scheme in which David
was involved also led to criminal indictments against David and four others for
their participation in the scheme. David pleaded guilty to charges against him.
On February 17, 1987, the Commission
instituted an action against Israel G.
Grossman.'? a former associate at a law firm, and six others for trading while in
possession
of material nonpublic information allegedly misappropriated
by
Grossman from the law firm. The Commission alleged that Grossman misappropriated information concerning a recapitalization of a client, and passed that information on to the other defendants. Those defendants allegedly traded while in possession of the information, realizing illegal profits of approximately $1.5 million. In
12

supporting papers filed in the action, the Commission
alleged that the defendants
attempted to conceal their activities from the Commission
by fabricating a story
concerning the reasons for their trading. At the close of the fiscal year, the case was
pending against all seven defendants.
Grossman has been convicted of criminal violations arising out of the insider
trading scheme.
On March 11, 1987, the Commission
filed SEC v. Nahum Vaskevitch, 20 against
a former managing director in charge of mergers and acquisitions in the London
office of a United States broker-dealer,
David Sofer, a businessman, and two entities. The Commission
alleged that Vaskevitch provided Sofer with material nonpublic information obtained during the course of his employment
concerning mergers, tender offers, and other extraordinary
corporate transactions. Sofer allegedly
traded while in possession of the information through accounts in the names of the
two entities. The defendants allegedly realized over $4 million in illegal profits as a
result of the scheme.
On March 30, 1987, an order was entered against the defendants preliminarily
enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities
laws, and orders were entered freezing assets, providing for an accounting, and
preventing alteration or destruction of documents. At the end of the fiscal year, the
case was still in litigation.

Regulated Entities and Associated Persons-The

enforcement
program area
that accounts for the largest number of cases involves regulated entities such as
broker-dealers, investment companies, investment advisers and transfer agents.
Ensuring that regulated entities conduct their business with integrity and fair-

ness is a consistent priority with the Commission.
The Commission
commenced
117 enforcement proceedings involving regulated entities during fiscal year 1987.
Seventeen of these cases involved securities offerings violations by regulated entities. Of the other cases, 75 were brought against broker-dealers
or persons associated with broker-dealers,
18 primarily involved investment advisers, and six primarily involved investment companies.
Broker-dealer
cases generally involve violations such as fraudulent sales practices, violations of the net capital and customer protection provisions, or brokerdealer books and records violations. On June 15, 1987, the Commission
instituted
a proceeding, in which it found that Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc}l
a brokerdealer, on multiple occasions improperly
used customers'
securities for stock
loans. In violation of the customer protection provisions of the Exchange Act, the
securities were delivered out of safekeeping before receipt of anticipated deliveries
of equivalent securities had been verified. In the largest such transaction, the
broker-dealer improperly used customer's securities worth $69 million. Shearson
Lehman consented to a Commission
order censuring it and ordering it to comply
with its undertakings
to implement procedures and establish policies to prevent a
recurrence of the violations.
The Commission's
financial recordkeeping
and reporting provisions require
broker-dealers subject to the Currency and Foreign Transaction Reporting Act of
1970 to report currency deposits in excess of $10,000. On February 27, 1987, the
Commission filed an administrative
proceeding, in which it found that Dean Witter

13

Reynolds, Inc. failed to file such reports in repeated instances.22 Dean Witter, by
consent, was censured and ordered to comply with its undertakings to implement
procedures designed to correct its reporting deficiencies, and to have its compliance with such procedures reviewed by an independent public accountant
In January 1987, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings, In the
Matter of Advest, Inc.,23 concerning alleged customer overcharges for mutual
fund sales commissions. The broker-dealer revised its compliance procedures
and refunded to customers over $600,000 after the Commission staff notified it of
the problem. The broker-dealer consented to a Commission order finding that it
had failed to ensure against such overcharges and censuring it for having failed
reasonably to supervise its registered representatives to prevent such overcharges.
At the end of the fiscal year the case remained pending against other respondents.
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission revoked the registration of 11 firms,
suspended 18 and censured 15. This compares with seven revocations, eight suspensions, and 15 censures in fiscal year 1986. Also during the fiscal year 79 individuals were barred, 26 suspended, and three censured, as compared to 58 bars,
20 suspensions, and 11 censures in 1986.
Securities Offering Yiolations-s-Sotne issuers fail to register public offerings of
their securities, although required to do so by the Securities Act Some purport to
rely on exemptions to registration requirements which are not available. Some violate antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by making material misrepresentations or omissions in connection with a securities offering. There were 40
cases principally involving offering violations by issuers and other persons brought
during fiscal year 1987. (This figure does not include 17 cases principally involving
offering violations on the part of regulated entities, which are discussed above).
This past fiscal year, the Commission instituted a series of proceedings conceming so-called "blank-check" offerings, registered offerings in which the proposed use of proceeds has not been disclosed. Such offerings have been the subject of abuse by promoters and entrepreneurs in various parts of the country, who
have used them in connection with a variety of schemes. For example, on February
13, 1987, the Commission filed an injunctive action alleging that Steven A. Keyser,24former president of L'Oiseau Bleu Corporation which had a registered offering in November 1985 for the stated purpose of engaging "in the acquisition of
business endeavors in one or more industries", diverted almost all of the offering
proceeds to his own use. The case was pending at the end of the fiscal year.
On June 2, 1987, the Commission suspended the Regulation A exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of Gin Enterprises, Inc., based
on, among other things, the failure to disclose the involvement of the conflict of interest of George L. Norman, the promoter of the offering, who was also an affiliate
and promoter of 18 other blank-check offerings.25
In a separate proceeding, the Commission instituted administrative proceedings
pursuant to Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice against Myron E. Berryman,26 auditor of the financial statements of the registration statements or offering circulars filed for each of the 18 public offerings. Citing identical deficiencies in
each of the 18 audit reports, the Commission concluded that the auditor failed to
obtain sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable basis for the reports, and that

14

such failure to comply with GAAS constituted improper professional conduct. Berryman consented to the issuance of a Commission order permanently suspending
him from appearing before the Commission, but providing that after two years he
may apply to resume appearing before the Commission upon fulfilling certain
conditions.
On March 31, 1987, the Commission instituted an injunctive action against
Charles Phillip Elliott and others involved in the operation of an alleged unregistered broker-deelerf" The complaint alleged that the defendants obtained at least
$50 million from at least 1000 investors through the sale of unregistered debt securities, and that they failed to disclose, among other things, that securities purportedly pledged as collateral for the investments were routinely rehypothecated.
Elliotand the various entities through which he operated consented to the entry of
a permanent injunction, to an accounting of proceeds received, and to disgorgement of an amount to be determined by the court at a later date. A temporary restraining order was entered by the COllrt against the two remaining defendants.
Commission is charged with ensuring the integrity of
trading on the national securities exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets.
The Commission staff, the exchanges and the NASD engage in surveillance of
these markets. The Commission brought 12 cases primarily involving market manipulation during fiscal year 1987, compared with 14 in 1986. One of these cases
was SEC v. Boyd L. Jefferies, et aL., discussed above.
On April 9, 1987, the Commission filed an action, SEC v. Andrew Nanos, et
ai.,28 in which it alleged that the six defendants violated the antifraud and the beneficialownership provisions of the federal securities laws. The Commission alleged,
among other things, that the defendants manipulated the market in a stock which
had been the subject of a negative news article by placing purchase orders for the
stock with numerous broker-dealers in order to prevent a price decrease. The case
was pending at the close of the fiscal year.

Market ManipuLation-The

13 and 14 of the Exchange Act govern
proxy solicitations and the filing of reports by persons or groups who make a tender offer or acquire beneficial ownership of more than five percent of a class of
equity securities registered with the Commission. These requirements are intended to ensure that investors have the material information needed to make informed investment or voting decisions concerning potential changes in the control
of a corporation. During fiscal year 1987, the Commission brought four enforcement actions which were primarily corporate control cases, compared to six in
1986.
On July 22, 1987, the Commission issued an order in an administrative proceeding, finding that Allied Stores Corporatiorr'" violated the tender offer solicitation provisions of the Exchange Act by failing properly to disclose steps taken by
Allied in response to a tender offer, including adoption of a resolution by Allied's
board of directors directing management to execute a merger agreement with a
third party. Allied consented to the entry of the Commission order to comply with
such provisions in the future.
Changes in Corporate ControL-Section

15

The administrative proceeding was pending at fiscal year end against the attorney for Allied Stores, who was named as a respondent
Sources {or Further Inquiry-The
Commission publishes in the SEC Docket litigation releases which describe its civilinjunctive actions and criminal proceedings

involving securities-related violations. Among other things, these releases report
the identity of the defendants, the nature of the alleged violative conduct, and the
disposition or status of the case. Commission orders that institute administrative
proceedings or provide remedial relief also are published in the SEC Docket

Full Disclosure System
Key 1987 Results
The full disclosure system is administered by the Division of Corporation Finance. The disclosure system is designed to provide investors with full and accurate material information, foster investor confidence, contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, facilitate capital formation, and inhibit fraud in
the public trading, voting, purchase, and sale of securities.
Administration of the full disclosure program was affected by a number of legal
and economic developments in fiscal year 1987. The passage of the Tax Re(orm
Act of 1986 on October 22, 1986, required the dedication of substantial staff resources in the first quarter of the year to accommodate
the large number of filings
made on an accelerated time schedule to assure certain tax consequences.
The
1986-87 proxy season in the second and third quarters was characterized by over
two thousand issuers that sought shareholder approval of the implementation of
new state corporate law provisions allowing for reducing director liabilities and
broadening indemnification
of corporate officers and directors. The new issue
market continued to flourish, with registration statements for initial public offerings
under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) approximating fiscal year 1986's
high. Approximately 43 percent of the regionally filed registration statements filed
in fiscal year 1987 covered blank check offerings.
Corporate acquisitions and restructurings were also at high levels. In fiscal year
1987,215 third party tender offers with a value of $85.5 billion were commenced,
representing a 47 percent increase over 146 offers with a value of $54 billion in fiscal year 1986. In view of the increasing complexity and multiplicity of accounting
issues arising in the filing review process, the Division hired 30 accountants during
the year. This effort is part of the Division's on-going program to have at least 50
percent of its review staff comprised of accountants.
The active acquisition market was evidenced in the 328 merger proxy filings and
the 209 going-private transactions filed during the year. That market was also
characterized by an increasing use of bridge loans financed by investment banking
firms and high-yield debt securities Gunk bonds). Proxy contests, which decreased
substantially for most of fiscal year 1987, increased during the last quarter to bring
the year end total to nearly the same level as fiscal year 1986. Asset-backed financings continued to increase, including those backed by credit card receivables, automobile loans, residential mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage leases,
Mack Truck loans, and loans made by the Federal Farmers Home Administration.
New instruments
continued to proliferate with offerings of reverse principal
exchange-rate linked securities (pERtS), liquid yield option notes (LYONS), and
currency exchange warrants (CEWS) being filed.
In legislative, rulemaking and interpretive matters, the Commission took action
on a wide range of issues. The Commission adopted a rule that eliminates the need
to file most pricing amendments
to Securities Act registration statements. In the
17

tender offer area, the Commission proposed for comment rules to govern "market
sweeps" and in an interpretive release, reiterated its view that material changes in
the terms of a tender offer must be disseminated in a manner that gives security
holders sufficient time to consider and act on the new information. The Commission also proposed to eliminate the requirement to file proxy statements in preliminary form where the shareholders at an annual meeting will consider only the election of directors, selection of auditors and certain shareholder proposals.
Amendments to modernize the Trust Indenture Act were recommended for submission to the Congress.

Excludes reviewsof certain amendments to post-effective registration statements filed in
response to staff comments on a prior post-effective filing.
Includes reports reviewed in connection with other filings.

In fiscal year 1987, 82,883 full disclosure filings were made with the Commission, an increase of 8 percent over fiscal year 1986. The number of registration
statements filed under the Securities Act increased to 7,708 from 7,358 filings in
fiscal year 1986. This includes 2,233 and 2,182 filings, respectively, by issuers who
had not previously offered securities to the public.
During fiscal year 1987, the staff fully reviewed financial statements of 3,865 registrants. This was accomplished through the full review of, among other things,
1,949 and 187 registration statements filed by new issuers under the Securities Act
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), respectively; 775 registration statements filed under the Securities Act by issuers with existing public security holders; 1,389 annual reports filed by issuers under the Exchange Act; and
full financial statement reviews of 60 issuers. The staff also fully reviewed annual
meeting proxy statements of 3,046 issuers, and 65 proxy contest filings. The substantial increase in reviews of annual meeting proxy statements from the fiscal year
1986 level (l,629) was due primarily to issuers adopting new officer and director liability and indemnification provisions provided for under state law. During the year,
248 merger proxies and 215 third-party tender offer and 209 going private transactions were reviewed.

Rulemaking. Interpretive.

and Legislative Matters

PricingAmendments
On May 27, 1987, the Commission adopted new Rule 430A under the Securities
Act,30 which was proposed earlier in the year. The rule allows registrants, under
specified conditions, to omit information on the public offering price, other matters
dependent upon the public offering price, terms of the securities dependent upon
the offering date, and the underwriting syndicate from the form of prospectus filed
as part of a registration statement that is declared effective. Rule 430A requires that
the omitted information be contained in a prospectus filed within a specified time
frame or in a post-effective amendment. Also adopted were amendments to the filing rules for prospectuses used after effectiveness, which eliminate unnecessary
filings, classify prospectuses according to the nature of the information being
added or modified, and shorten the filing period.
Tender Offers
On October 1, 1987, the Commission published for comment proposed rules
that would govern certain acquisitions undertaken during and shortly after a conventional tender offer for securities of the same class and related activities.31 With
certain exceptions the proposed rules would require that purchases, offers to purchase, arrangements or understandings to purchase and solicitations of offers to
sell securities undertaken during and shortly after a tender offer that would increase any person's ownership of the class of securities subject to the tender offer
by 10 percent or more of the class be made in compliance with the statutory provisions and rules applicable to tender offers.
The Commission issued an interpretive release on April 3, 1987, with respect to
the disclosure and dissemination of material changes in the terms of tender offers.32 The Commission expressed its view that a waiver of a minimum share condition is a material change in the terms of the offer and reiterated its view that material changes must be disseminated in a manner reasonably calculated to inform
security holders of such changes and within sufficient time for them to consider
and act on such new information, generally a minimum of five to ten business
days.
ProxyRules
On June 4, 1987, the Commission published for comment a proposal to eliminate the requirement to file proxy or information statements in preliminary form
where the only matters to be considered at an annual shareholder meeting are the
election of directors, selection of auditors and/or certain shareholder proposals."
The Commission also proposed certain amendments to the shareholder proposal
rule, including the deletion or modification of the provision for exclusion of a
shareholder proposal where a proponent delivers written proxy materials to holders of more than 25% of a class of the registrant's securities.
On May 21, 1987, the Commission adopted amendments, proposed earlier in
the year, to its proxy rules and certain other rules. The amendments conformed
further the proxy disclosure for mergers and similar transactions to that required
19

for registration of securities in certain business combinations. They also clarified
the timing requirements for such transactions where incorporation by reference is
used.34 The Commission also adopted a rule concerning modified or superseded
statements in documents incorporated by reference into a proxy statement
Shareholder Communications
On March 27, 1987, and June 18, 1987, the Commission published for comment proposals that would exclude, on an optional or mandatory basis, specified
employee benefit plan participants from the operation of the proxy processing
and/or direct communications provisions of the shareholder communications
rules.35 Under these alternative proposals, an employee benefit plan participant
would not receive proxy material through brokers and banks in accordance with
the proxy processing provisions of the shareholder communications rules where
(l) the plan provides a mechanism for forwarding such materials to plan participants; or (2) the registrant has access to participant names and addresses and is
not prohibited from communicating with them, with the registrant required to
cause proxy material to be furnished to plan participants. The alternative proposals
also provide for exclusion of plan participants from the direct communications
provisions if the registrant otherwise has access to the names and addresses of
such beneficial owners.
Prospectus De6very Requirements
On December 18, 1986, the Commission published for comment alternative
proposals to reduce the 40 or 90 day period during which dealers must deliver prospectuses in aftermarket securities transactions following public offerings.36 Both
of the proposals would provide relief, under certain circumstances, with respect to
aftermarket transactions in the securities of issuers not subject to the periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act prior to fIlingtheir registration statements.
On July 31, 1987, the Commission published for comment two alternative proposals for a new Rule 433 concerning the timing of delivery to investors of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10(a) of the Securities Act37 The
proposals would permit, if all conditions are satisfied, the sending of a final prospectus no later than five business days after a confirmation of sale is sent to a purchaser in a registered firm commitment offering of securities for cash.
Exempt Private Offerings
On January 2, 1987,38 the Commission published for comment proposed
amendments to Regulation D and Rule 215 and solicited comments on other possible revisions of Regulation D, including the application of a good faith compliance standard. The Regulation D amendments, as proposed, would (l) expand the
accredited investor defmition under Rule 501, (2) raise the offering ceiling and expand the aVailabilityof general solicitation under Rule 504, and (3) make certain
technical amendments to Regulation D in an effort to clarify the rules of the regulation and to codify certain staff interpretations under the regulation.

20

Employee Benefit Plans
On January 2, 1987, the Commission proposed new Rules 701, 702 and 703,
whichwould provide an exemption from the registration requirements of the SecuritiesAct for limited offers and sales of securities in connection with compensatory
employee benefit plans by issuers not subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements.39 As a result of public comments on the proposal, the rules were revised
and reproposed in August 1987.40
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The Commission published a concept release on April 17, 1987, discussing the
disclosure required by Management's Discussion and Analysis and requesting
public comment on the adequacy of these requirements." The Commission specificallyrequested comment on recent recommendations by several accounting
firms that Management's Discussion and Analysis contain more risk disclosure
and be subject to audit 42 The Commission is reviewing comments made in response to this release to determine whether any rulemaking is appropriate.
Classification of Issuers
A concept release was issued by the Commission on July 8, 1986,43 requesting
information and suggestions from the public concerning possible substitute or
supplementary threshold criteria governing entry into and exit from the Exchange
Actreporting requirements. In addition, a study was commissioned on the effect of
those requirements on small businesses. The study, which is being conducted by
The SEC and the Financial Reporting Institute of the Universityof Southern California, is expected to be completed and a final report issued in fiscal year 1988.
Publication of No-Action and Interpretive Letters
On September 22, 1987, the Commission published for comment a proposal
that, with certain exceptions, would provide for the expedited publication of interpretiveand no-action correspondence at the time a response is sent or given to the
requesting party, unless temporary confidential treatment is granted.44 The Commission also proposed to codify the application of the existing publication rule to
certain exemption letters.
Trust Indenture Legislative Proposal
On November 30, 1987, the Commission submitted its recommendations for
amendment of the Trust Indenture Act to Congress. If enacted, the proposed bill,
entitled the Trust Indenture Reform Act of 1987, will comprehensively modernize
federal regulation of publicly-offered debt securities. Under the proposed bill,
mandatory indenture terms would be self-executing and imposed by law, a measure that willsimplify preparation of indentures. Conflicts of interest would be relevant to a trustee's eligibility only after default The proposal would also broaden
the Commission's exemptive authority to allow variation from the statute in appropriate circumstances and would conditionally allow foreign trusteeships.

21

Internationalization
On July 29, 1987, the staff sent to Congress a report on the internationalization
of the securities market The report included a chapter prepared by the Division on
the disclosure and distribution standards in multinational and international issues
of securities. The chapter included a descriptive analysis of the international financial markets and the effects of regulation on these markets. An overview of United
States distribution and disclosure practices that affect foreign issuers, and the disclosure, distribution, and tender offer practices in several nations other than the
United States were also discussed. The discussion concluded with an evaluation of
the major issues and problems raised by international offerings.

Conferences
SEC Government-Business

Forum on Small Business Capital Formation

The sixth annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital
Formation was held in Washington, D.C. on September 14-15, 1987. Approximately 150 small business executives, accountants, attorneys, government officials and other small business representatives were in attendance. The format of
this year's conference was structured around a series of lectures and discussion
groups on federal, state and local equity financing programs and other more traditional equity financing techniques such as venture capital, securities offerings
and employee stock option plans. The final report on the conference, which Is issued to Congress and available to the public, will be presented this year in an
informational-type pamphlet rather than setting forth a list of recommendations
for legislative and regulatory changes in the area of small business capital formation which has been the basis for the final reports for most of the previous forums.
SEC/NASAA Conference under Section 19(c) of the Securities Act

InApril 1987, approximately 35 senior staff officials of the Commission met with
representatives of the North American Securities Administrators Association Inc.
in Baltimore, Maryland, to discuss methods of effectuating greater uniformity in
federal and state securities matters. Following the conference, the staff issued a
final report that described two resolutions that were approved, summarized the discussions of the working groups, and identified conference participants.

Accounting and Auditing Matters
Key 1987 Results
The federal securities laws provide for the audit of financial statements of publicly held corporations by independent accountants. Thus, those laws have placed
upon the accountant important responsibilities in facilitating the capital formation
processes, and as a result, the economy as a whole.
Today, the accounting profession is subject to a unique combination of public
and private sector initiatives that is designed to ensure that the profession meets its
public responsibilities. These initiatives include peer review and other membership
requirements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Division for CPA Firms, private sector standards-setting, the Commission's programs (including oversight of private sector initiatives), state licensing activities
and private civil litigation against accounting firms. This framework has been built
over time and is subject to continued refinements and improvements.
The primary Commission programs for ensuring compliance with the accounting and financial disclosure aspects of federal securities laws are:
• Rulemaking initiatives which supplement accounting standards, implement
financial disclosures and establish independence criteria for accountants;
• The review and comment process which results in improvement of filings,
identification of emerging accounting issues (which can result in rulemaking
or private sector standards-setting), and identification of problems warranting
enforcement actions;
• The enforcement program, which imposes legal sanctions and serves to deter irregularities by enhancing the care with which registrants and their accountants analyze accounting issues; and
• Oversight of private sector efforts to establish accounting and auditing standards, and to improve the quality of audit practice.
The Commission's direct efforts are multiplied by the efforts of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the A1CPAand other activities of the profession
under Commission oversight In addition to Commission enforcement actions,
significant numbers of actions are brought by private litigants, many of which are
a direct result of Commission actions.
The cumulative effect of the Commission's programs, private sector initiatives
and civil litigation comprises a comprehensive system under which the integrity of
financial reporting for public companies is constantly being challenged, modified
and improved. The Commission's review and comment process and enforcement
programs are discussed elsewhere in this report The remainder of this section
summarizes the Commission's accounting-related rules and interpretations and
the oversight function.
Accounting-Related

Rules and Interpretations

Regulation S-X provides guidance as to the form and content of financial statements filed with the Commission. The Commission has also adopted various rules

23

that specify disclosure of financial information outside of the financial statements.
For example, certain supplementary financial information, selected financial data
and a management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition
and results of operations are required by Regulation S-K.
To address significant accounting issues, the Commission may issue interpretive releases and, when announcing rule changes, provide guidance for compliance with new or amended rules. In addition, the Commission staff periodically issues Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) to inform the financial community of its
views on accounting and disclosure issues.
As for rulemaking initiatives, the Commission, during the past fiscal year,
adopted rules which improve and simplify disclosures made by bank holding companies about loans to borrowers in countries experiencing liquidity problerns.P
The Commission also amended its rules to delete certain requirements to disclose
the effects of inflation and changing prices called for by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 33 to conform with a similar action taken by the FASB.46
In announcing this action, the Commission emphasized that registrants will continue to be required to discuss the effects of inflation within Management's Discussion and Analysis, when material. The Commission also issued a concept release
on Management's Discussion and Analysis based on suggestions from major accounting flrms.""
In the interpretive area, a release was issued to address various matters relating
to accounting for loan losses by registrants engaged in lending activities.48
In addition to requiring financial disclosure of registrants, Commission rules
also address the qualifications of accountants, including their independence and
accountants' reports on financial statements, and require disclosure about a registrant's public accountants. In April 1987, the Commission issued proposed rules
which would require all accountants of public companies to undergo peer review.49 The Commission's proposal would require that financial statements included in filings be certified by an independent accountant that had undergone a
peer review of its accounting and auditing practice within the three years prior to
the filingand has established and is complying with an audit quality control system
meeting the requirements under generally accepted auditing standards. The proposal contains certain peer review standards, minimum requirements for a peer review organization, and a procedure whereby the final authority to determine
whether an accountant may continue to practice before the Commission rests with
the Commission. This procedure would be used when a public accounting firm
failed to remedy material deficiencies in its quality controls. The comment period
expired July 9, 1987, and comment letters are presently being reviewed by the staff
with a view toward developing recommendations for Commission consideration.
On June 18, 1987, the Commission published for comment a proposal to
amend the disclosure requirements related to a registrant's change in independent
accountants. Ifadopted, the proposed item would require disclosure by the registrant of issues related to the registrant's financial statements discussed with the
new accountant during approximately the two years prior to its engagement 50 The
viewsof the new and old accountants on those issues would be summarized by the
registrant, and the names of other accountants consulted on those issues (and the
extent their views materially differed from the new accountant's views) would be
24

disclosed. Also, amendments to the current requirement to disclose disagreements with the former auditor were proposed to clarify when such disagreements
are deemed to have occurred. The comment period expired September 24, 1987,
and the staff is in the process for developing recommendations for Commission
consideration.
During fiscal year 1987, SASs were issued regarding (1) risk sharing in business
combinations accounted for as poolings of interest; (2) disclosure by bank holding
companies regarding loans to countries experiencing liquidity problems; (3) the
appropriate income statement presentation of restructuring charges; (4) accounting for increasing rate preferred stock; (5) the appropriate disclosure of lending
and deposit activities by financial institutions other than bank holding companies;
(6) accounting for non-recourse debt collateralized by lease receivables; and (7) financial statements of properties securing mortgage loans.51
Oversight of Private Sector Standards-Setting

In addition to its direct action through rulemaking and other programs, the
Commission monitors the structure, activity and decisions of the private sector
standards-setting organizations.
FASB-Although the Commission has adopted Regulation S-x, promulgated
other rules and disclosure requirements in the financial reporting area, and has
published interpretations and guidance where necessary, it has generally refrained
from prescribing the accounting methods to be followed in the preparation of financial statements.
In lieu of specifyjng accounting principles, the Commission has presumed financial statements to be misleading or inaccurate unless prepared in accordance
with accounting principles which have substantial authoritative support Under this
concept, the Commission looks to the FASS to provide the initiativein establishing
and improving accounting principles. Oversight of the process involves not only
Commission review of the standards set, but also the direct participation of staff
members and, in some instances, the Commission itself in the initial setting of
standards.

Staff members monitor developments closely and are in frequent contact with
the FASS, participate in meetings, public hearings, and task forces. The Commission monitors the progress of FASS projects and meets periodically withthe FASS
to discuss topical issues.
r7nandallnstruments-ln fiscal year 1986, the FASS (in response to a recommendation from the Commission's Chief Accountant) added a major long-term
project to its agenda that will address financial instruments and off balance sheet
fmancing issues. The project is comprised of several parts, some of which will be
developed simultaneously. Significant parts of the project include (a) disclosure
about financial assets and transactions, (b) accounting for risk-transfer instruments such as guarantees and interest rate hedging instruments, (c) off balancesheet financing arrangements, (d) the appropriate measurement basis for financial
instruments; and (e) accounting for securities with both debt and equity characteristics.

Subsequent

to

fiscal year end, the FASS issued an exposure draft which would

require certain disclosures about financial assets and liabilities now canied in the

25

balance sheet and obligations. commitments and guarantees not now recognized
in financial staternents.Y
Consolidations and the Equity Method-In November 1987, the FASB issued
a statement requiring consolidation of all majority-owned subsidiaries unless control is temporary or does not rest with the majority owner.53 This statement is part
of a broader project which includes development of a concept of the reporting entity,and its application to the issue of consolidation policy.
Cash FLow Reporting-The
FASB issued a statement requiring a statement of
cash flows to be presented as part of a fullset of financial statements of all business
enterprises, replacing the statement of changes in financial position.54
Income Taxes-Subsequent to fiscal year end, the FASB issued a statement on
accounting for income taxes. The statement represents a significant change in the
method of accounting for income taxes by adopting a liability approach to the issue of comprehensive interperiod tax allocatlon.P?
ReguLatedEnterprises-The FASB issued statements on accounting for abandonments and disallowances of plant costs and accounting for phase-in plans.56
Both of these statements involve rate-regulated enterprises and represent amendments to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71.
Other Projects-Other significant projects on the FASB's technical agenda include stock compensation plans, sales and leasebacks involving real estate, postemployment benefits other than pensions and accounting for universal life insurance.
TimeLyFinancial Reporting Guidance-Encouraged
by the Commission, the
FASB has continued its efforts to provide more timely guidance on emerging issues. Technical bulletins issued in fiscal year 1987 by the FASB staff included guidance on accounting for (a) certain effects of the Tax Reform Act;57(b) interests in
the residual value of a leased asset;58 and (c) changes in the method of accounting
for certain postretirement benefits.59 In addition, a technical bulletin concerning
accounting for mortgage servicing fees and rights was finalized after fiscal year
end.60
Also, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) (in which the Commission's Chief
Accountant plays a significant role) has discussed over 150 issues since its inception in 1984, covering a range of specific issues such as financial instruments and
financial institutions, business combinations, and income taxes. A number of the
issues were introduced by or at the request of the Commission. On many issues,
the group reached a consensus that either: (a) a single method of accounting is
preferable based on existing literature; (b) existing guidance is adequate; or (c) the
issue does not present a pervasive problem. Other issues have been referred to the
FASB or the A1CPAfor action or further consideration. The Commission expects
the positions agreed upon at those meetings to be followed by registrants. Those
that do not follow them will be asked to justify departure from any consensus
reached. Based on the work of the EITF to date, the Commission believes that the
EITF is performing a useful role in providing timely guidance to registrants and
their accountants.
Oversight of the Accounting Profession's Initiatives
In addition to oversight of the private sector process for setting accounting stan-

26

dards, the Commission also oversees various activities of the accounting profession conducted primarily through the AICPA. These include (a) the Auditing Standards Board (ASB), which establishes generally accepted auditing standards; (b)
the Accounting Standards Executive Committee, which provides guidance on specific industry practices and prepares issues papers on accounting topics for consideration by the FASB; and (c) the SEC Practice Section (SECPS) of the Division
for CPAFirms, which seeks to improve the quality of accounting firms through various membership requirements including peer review.
The AICPA, along with other organizations, sponsored the National Commission
on Fraudulent Financial Reporting (NCFFR), an independent commission which
studied issues involved in the prevention and detection of fraud in the context of financial reporting. The NCFFR issued its report in October 1987.61 The report contains recommendations for the public company, the independent public accountant, and for the Commission and others to improve the regulatory and legal
environment The Commission staff is evaluating these recommendations.
In February 1987, the ASB issued for public comment ten proposed standards
which comprise the so-called "Expectation Gap" projects. These proposals include projects relating to the auditor's standard report and auditor responsibilities
for detection and reporting of fraud and evaluating an entity's continued existence.62 The Commission staff is supportive of the ASB's efforts to enhance auditors' communication and responsibilities and is closely monitoring the ASB's
progress toward establishing final standards in these areas.
SEC Practice Section-The Commission oversees the activities of the SECPS
through frequent contact with the Public Oversight Board (POB) and members of
the executive and peer review committees of the SECPS. In addition, the staff reviews POB files and selected working papers of the peer reviewers. The Commission believes the peer review process contributes significantly to improving the
quality control systems of member firms and thus should enhance the consistency
and quality of practice before the Commission. According to the POB's Annual Report as of June 30, 1987, 395 firms have voluntarily become members of the
SECPS, including all firms with 30 clients reporting to the Commlssion.F'
Special Investigations Committee-Activities
of the Special Investigations
Committee (SIC) supplement peer review. The SIC determines whether allegations
of failure in the conduct of an audit indicate need for improvements in, or compliance with, quality control systems of the reporting firms, whether changes in professional standards are required, and whether any corrective action taken by the
firm was appropriate. The POB monitors the activities of the SIC and has complete
access to the process and to SIC files.
The Commission staff also monitors the SIC process. However, as the audits reported to the SIC are generally the subject of litigation, the Commission's access
to documentation of the SIC review has been limited. Because of this limited access the Commission does not have a basis for reaching any conclusions about
the SIC process. In an effort to find ways to improve the Commission's access to
SIC documentation and to address other concerns, the SECPS Executive Committee appointed the Task Force on SIC Methodology. This task force recommended, among other things, that more comprehensive and informative summaries be furnished to the Commission when a case is closed and that the SIC meet

27

reguladywith the Commission staff to discuss concerns the Commission staff may
have with actions taken by the SIC as reflected in the summaries and any changes
the Commission believes would make the process more effective. The Commission staff, however, has just begun to review SIC documents prepared under the
new procedures, and has not yet reached a conclusion as to whether they willenable the Commission to fully assess the effectiveness of the SIC function.

The EDGAR Project
Key 1987 Results
Introduction

The primary purpose of EDGAR is to increase the efficiency and faimess of the
securities markets for the benefit of investors, securities issuers, and the economy.
Under EDGAR, information will be filed electronically for acceptance and review
by the Commission staff. Once accepted, public information also will be rapidly
available to investors, the media and others on computer screens via public reference rooms or subscription services. When fully operational, EDGAR will accelerate dramatically the filing, processing, dissemination and analysis of timesensitive corporate information filed with the Commission.
The EDGAR Pilot system completed its third full year of successful operations
on September 24, 1987. It has demonstrated clearly the feasibility of electronic
filingand review procedures. Over 20,000 electronic filings have been made since
September 1984.
The Commission also continued to move ahead with its plan to develop a fully
operational EDGAR system. The Request for Proposals (RFP) was amended to reflect changes in EDGAR funding strategy and released on October 23, 1987.
Pilot System

The Pilot system serves a group of volunteer companies whose filings are processed by the Divisions of Corporation Finance and Investment Management At
the end of fiscal year 1987,299 corporations plus 198 investment companies and
21 public utilities were filing electronically as fullyparticipating registrants. An additional 700 investment companies participate partially in the Pilot by electronically fIlingtheir annual and semi-annual reports on Form N-SAR.
As a consequence of this growth, the Pilot was closed to most new participants
as of August 31, 1986. Generally, the only exceptions are for affiliates of current
Pilot participants and initial public offerings by registrants whose filings are processed by the Division of Corporation Finance. In addition, Public UtilityHolding
Company Act filings and Forms N-SAR and 13F-E may be submitted electronically even if the filer is not a current Pilot participant Companies also may continue to make test filings via the Pilot
In fiscal year 1987, certain enchancements were added to the Pilot to make electronic fIlingmore convenient and test potential productivity improvements for the
operational system. For example, a reference fIling capability was added in November 1986. This capability permits filers to submit an electronic reference filing
which can then be included in subsequent electronic fIlings by designation in lieu
of retransmission. As a result of this enhancement, the Commission received more
than 4,400 reference fIlings through September 30, 1987. By using the reference

29

capability, the filers avoided the cost of submitting over 89,000 pages. One reference filing was incorporated into 726 separate electronic documents.
Another Pilot enhancement permits institutional investment managers to file
Form 13F voluntarily on magnetic tape using temporary Form 13F-E. Participating investment managers that maintain 13F information on a computer willno
longer need to transmit paper copies of these reports to the Commission. As more
filers submit Form 13F-E electronically, there willbe more rapid compilation and
dissemination of summary information. Processing of Form 13F-E tapes includes
automated receipt and acceptance procedures that are more efficient than the
procedures used to process other tape filings. The experience gained with these
new procedures willbe incorporated in the design of the operational system.
In January 1987, the central processing unit of the Pilot was upgraded from an
IBM-4381-ModeI2 to an IBM4381-Model Q14. This nearly doubled processing
capacity, improved internal response time, and added dual processing capabilities. Further enhancements were made at the end of fiscal year 1987 to increase
disk storage, tape backup and the number of EDGAR terminals within the Commission. These enhancements willenable the Pilot to handle the larger volume of
filings that is anticipated during the next fiscal year. They also provide a framework
for testing procedural and system enhancements that may be incorporated in operational EDGAR.
Operational System
During fiscal year 1987, plans for Operational EDGAR continued to move forward. The EDGAR RFP was originally released on May 7, 1986. Bids were ultimately received on February 27, 1987, after two closing date extensions due to requests by potential offerors. On July 22, 1987, prior to awarding the contract, the
Commission announced its intention to reopen competition for 90 days because
of a change in the funding strategy for the operational contract.
Under the prior RFP, federal funding for the EDGAR contract was limited to a
maximum of $46.5 million for the acceptance and review subsystem. Excess
funds were to be spent on the receipt subsystem. The contractor was expected to
fund the remainder of the receipt subsystem and all of the dissemination subsystem and recover costs via the regulated sale of data and services. In response
to a GAO recommendation, and subsequent discussions with Congressional staff,
the Commission agreed to fully fund the receipt subsystem as well as the acceptance and review subsystem. This change, coupled with an analysis of the bids received and the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, resulted in the
decision to amend the RFP and reopen competition.
The Commission staff subsequently reviewed and amended the RFP to conform with the new funding strategy and the Commission's authorization legislation. Under the amended RFP,the Commission willfullyfund the development and
operation of the receipt and acceptance and reviewsubsystems. The cost of developing and operating the dissemination subsystem willbe borne by the contractor
and recovered as before. The amended RFP is structured as a costreimbursement plus fixed fee contract for the first three years with the fee calculated on labor and overhead costs only. The last fiveyears are structured as a fixed
price contract as before.
30

The RFP,as amended, requires that offerors who intend to provide retail services
in addition to regulated services pay the same Levell subscription fee as other entitieswho purchase the entire EDGAR data base. This fee willnot be waived unless
the contractor can show that such payment willplace it at a significant competitive
disadvantage.
The amended RFP provides for an extended phase-in period for mandatory
filing,from 36 months up to 48 months, and longer if necessary. This is necessary
to allow a reasonable time for system development and a six month test period for
the initial group of mandatory filers.
The amended RFP was released on October 23, 1987, with proposals due in late
January 1988. Further consideration of existing offers willbe deferred until any additional interested parties have had an opportunity to submit their proposals.
Office of EDGAR Management
The Commission has enhanced its managerial and technical expertise in preparation for the operational system by creating a separate Office of EDGAR Management
The Director reports to the Chairman of the Commission and has overall responsibility for the procurement, implementation and operation of the EDGAR
system. In addition to overseeing the Office of Edgar Management, the Director is
the contract officer for the project with responsibility for maintaining liaison within
the Commission and with filers and users of the filed information. The Director will
be assisted in these tasks by a professional staff including two special assistants, a
legal counsel, and an industrial liaison representative. Also reporting to the Director willbe three branch chiefs for contract administration, filer training and assistance, and technical systems administration. When fully staffed in late 1988, the
Office of EDGAR Management will consist of approximately 40 employees.
Conclusion
The Commission is firmly committed to proceeding with EDGAR. Work on the
operational system in fiscal year 1988 will include proposal evaluation, contract
award, rulemaking, development of a filer training/support staff, and preparation
for the transition from the Pilot to the Operational EDGAR.

Key 1987 Results
The Division of Market Regulation, with the assistance of the regional offices, is
charged with the responsibility of overseeing the operations of the nation's securities markets and market professionals. In fiscal year 1987, over 11,000 brokerdealers and ten exchanges as well as the over-the-counter markets were subject to

During fiscal year 1987, the Commission designated 500 new over-the-counter
securities as National Market System (NMS) securities for a total of 3,000. Unlisted
trading privileges were granted to 25 National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ)/NMS securities to be traded by the Midwest Stock Exchange (MSE). Mortgage-backed securities transactions, transactions that settle in same-day funds and mutual fund orders were added to the National Clearance and Settlement System. The immobilization of the securities
certificate was expanded by the addition of California as the forty-seventh state to
allow domiciliary insurance companies to use securities depositories. The use of
book-entry systems was extended to corporate debt offerings when Ford Motor
Credit Corporation issued $200 million of three-year notes in "global certificate
form."
In response to increased market volatility, the staff examined the effects of indexrelated trading and published a study pertaining to specific market declines during

fiscal year 1987. The staff has undertaken additional studies scheduled for release
in fiscal year 1988 which will further examine these issues.
Intemationalization of the securities markets was furthered through the linkage
of a variety of clearing agencies for both equities and options. Global securities offerings were granted certain exemptions from Rules 10b-6 and 10b-7 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), to permit "passive market making" and to accommodate
foreign regulations and practices with respect to offering and trading of securities. The Commission sponsored a roundtable discussion
on February 17, 1987, focusing on secondary market issues and primary offerings
in the intemational area. The Division also prepared a chapter in the Staff Report on
Intemationalization.
Rules were proposed to regulate certain acquisitions of blocks of securities
undertaken during and shortly after tender offers, referred to as "market sweeps."
Rules governing short sales practices in connection with underwritings were also
proposed.
The broker-dealer examination program was enhanced through the use of online systems which monitor the administration of the program by the nine regional
offices. Moreover, field examinations will shortly include review of net capital and
mark-up compliance by portable computers.

Securities Markets, Facilities and Trading
The National Market System
Rule 11Aa2-1 under the Exchange Act provides procedures for designating ceras NMS securities and Rule l1Aa3-1 requires that transactions in
NMS securities be reported on a real-time basis, increasing market efficiency and
improving execution of orders.
The Commission adopted amendments
to Rules 11Aa2-1 and 11Aa3-1 resulting in the designation as NMS securities of all securities-whether
traded on exchanges or over-the-counter
(OTCHor
which transaction reports are required to
be submitted pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan. The Commission
also adopted conforming amendments to related rules. Over 3,000 OTC securities
now are designated as NMS securities, 500 more than in fiscal year 1986.
In April 1987, the Commission approved the Midwest Stock Exchange's application for unlisted trading privileges on 25 NASDAQlNMS securities and approved
an interim joint transaction reporting plan submitted by the MSE and the National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to provide for consolidated reporting of
transaction and quotation data in these securities.64In addition, the Commission
is monitoring ongoing negotiations among the NASD and several exchanges, including the MSE, on a permanent transaction reporting plan for NASDAQlNMS
securities traded on one or more exchanges on a listed or unlisted basis.
The NASD submitted a proposed rule change to the Commission that, if approved, would provide the NASD with the authority to halt trading in NASDAQI
NMS securities pending the dissemination of material news by the issuer and to
halt trading in listed securities traded in the third market when the primary market
for the securities halts trading pending the dissemination of material news. The
Commission is currently considering the proposal.

The Commission also continued to study automation in the OTC market The
Commission issued a no-action position conceming the regulation of an automated OTC trading system (POSIT) informing the system developer that the Commission would not recommend enforcement action if such a system were not registered as an exchange.65 The Commission is now considering new regulatory
approaches for such systems.
National System for Clearance and Settlement
Securities Transactions

of

In fiscal year 1987, the Commission approved proposals that expanded the services of the National Clearance and Settlement System (National System) to
mortgage-backed securities transactions, transactions that settle in same-day
funds, and mutual fund orders. In February, the Commission granted the MBS
Clearing Corporation (MBSCC) temporary registration as a clearing agency, in
order to provide trade clearance and certificate depository services for mortgagebacked securities, including Govemment National Mortgage Association passthrough certificates.66 In July 1987, the Commission approved, on a pilot basis
through January 1988, the Depository Trust Company's (DTC) proposed sameday funds system, which expanded DTC's certificate immobilization and bookentry delivery services to certain securities settling in same-day funds, such as
short-term municipal notes.'" The Commission also approved extension of the
National Securities Clearing Corporation's (NSCC) Mutual Fund Settlement, Entry
and Registration Verification (Fund/SERV) Service, which provides centralized, automated handling of mutual fund orders.68
The Commission also approved a proposal that reduces foreign currency delivery obligations to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and the Intermarket
Clearing Corporation (ICC) for electing joint clearing rnernbers.P" This is accomplished by netting foreign currency delivery obligations arising from exercises and
assignments of foreign currency options at OCC with obligations to accept foreign
currency at ICC arising from settling foreign currency futures contracts.
Market Volatility Studies
On September 11 and 12, 1986, the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 120 points
on record volume, at that time one of the sharpest market declines in history. In response to public and Congressional concerns about the role of index-related arbitrage in the market decline, the Division of Market Regulation, in conjunction with
staff of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), conducted a review
of trading activity on those two days.
The Division observed the substantial use of index products by professional and
institutional investors to shift and control risk, and to respond to market movements. The Division concluded, however, that the magnitude of the September decline was a result of changes in investors' perceptions of fundamental economic
conditions, rather than artificial forces arising from index-related trading strategies.
Nevertheless, index-related futures trading was instrumental in the rapid transmission of these changed investor perceptions to individual stock prices, and may
have condensed the time period in which the decline occurred.
34

In addition, the Division has analyzed trading on "Expiration Fridays" and, with
the cooperation of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has implemented a plan
to reduce volatility on those days.
On September 19, 1986, the NYSE, at the request of the Commission, conducted an experiment in disseminating order imbalances in an attempt to address
volatility associated with the coincident expiration of index futures and options.
The NYSE sent a circular to member firms instructing them to submit all marketon-close (MaC) orders in the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks by 3:30
p.m., and provided for the public dissemination of all significant MaC order imbalences,"" This experiment worked well, and for the December 19 expiration the
NYSE expanded the experiment to include 50 stocks.
Securities Immobilization
In fiscal year 1987, the Commission continued to make progress in its effort to
increase the immobilization of securities certificates in securities depositories. For
example, California removed restrictions on depository use by domiciliary insurance companies for their portfolio assets. Forty-seven states now allow domiciliary
insurance companies to use depositories. Also during the fiscal year, issuers,
transfer agents, broker-dealers and clearing agencies, through several task forces,
continued their cooperative efforts to identify ways to increase the immobilization
of securities certificates and to experiment with uncertificated book-entry systems.
In 1986, Ford Motor Credit Corporation became the first "book-entry only" corporate debt issuer by issuing $200 million of three-year notes in "global certificate
form" through the DTC. In August 1987, IBM Credit Corporation became the second issuer of global certificate corporate debt obligations, with a $200 million note
offering. To date, corporate debt distributed in global certificate form totals $3.25
billion. In calendar year 1986, approximately $7.2 billion in municipal debt obligations were issued in global certificate form.
Internationalization
In its continuing efforts to foster the development of the internationalization of
the securities markets, the Commission sponsored a roundtable discussion on
February 17 that focused on secondary market issues and primary offerings in the
intemational context A summary of the intemationalization roundtable was prepared by the Commission. In addition, on August 5, 1987, the Commission submitted to Congress a comprehensive staff study of the internationalization of the
world's securities markets,"! The Commission continues to monitor and review international trading and clearing linkages and proposals.
DUring fiscal year 1987, the Commission took several actions with respect to the
application of Rules 1Ob-6 and 10b-7 under the Exchange Act to multinational offerings involving concurrent United States and foreign distributions. Rule lOb-6
proscribes certain conduct by persons participating in a distribution to ensure that
they do not artificially condition the market for a security to facilitate its distribution.
Rule lOb-7 regulates stabilization activities during distributions. The Commission's actions permitted non-United States distribution participants to continue
certain customary market activities in foreign jurisdictions, subject to certain con-

35

cIitions designed to assure that there would not be a manipulative impact on the
United States market. For example, in September
1987, a letter was issued to the
International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland
Umited (ISE) granting exemptions from Rules lOb-6 and lOb-7.72
The exemptions permit ISE member broker-dealers to engage in "passive market making" activities while such firms are participating in a multinational distribution of securities of certain United Kingdom issuers partially being offered in the
United Kingdom, or where the United Kingdom firms are affIliated with United
States broker-dealers participating in a distribution in the United States. "Passive
market making" refers to the ability of the United Kingdom rums to provide depth
and liquidity in the United Kingdom securities market by continuing to act as market makers, but the firms may not lead the market either in price or size of quotations. The exemptions were developed in a cooperative effort between the Commission and the ISE in response to a request from the ISE that the Commission
accommodate the ISE's new market making rules prohibiting "fair weather market
making" which appeared to be in conflict with Rule lOb-6.
Exemptions were also granted to permit affIliated purchasers of French and
Spanish distribution participants to bid for and purchase securities in the French
and Spanish markets, respectively, during multinational distributions?3ln
France,
a bank sponsoring the undeIWriting (or the issuer) generallywiJl assist French market makers in the maintenance of an orderly market for a period of time following
the distribution. In Spain, it is customary for affIliates of the issuer to act as market
makers, even during distributions, to ensure liquidity and modulate price swings.
Without the granted exemptions, such activities would have been prohibited by
Rule lOb-6.
Fmally, in May 1987, the Commission issued two exemption orders under Rule
lOb-7 with respect to stabilization of global securities offerings. The exemption
orders treated certain foreign markets as the "principal market" for purposes of determining appropriate stabilizing price levels.74
As part of its secondary market internationalization
program, the Commission
continued to foster the development
of international linkages between clearing
agencies. For example, the Commission issued no-action letters to the international Securities Clearing Corporation (ISCC) and NSCC to permit a pilot link with
the ISE. 75 The Commission also granted a no-action request from Midwest Clearing Corporation (MCC), Midwest Securities Trust Company (MSTC) and the Sodate Interprofessionelle pour la Compensation des Valeurs MobiJieres (SICOVAM)
permitting MCC/MSTC to maintain custody of securities for SICOVAM and, on a
fully disclosed basis, SICOVAM participants?6
The Commission has also fostered foreign participation in the National Clearance and Settlement System. The Commission approved acc rule changes that
exempt Canadian clearing members from acC's accounting and capital requirements keyed to United States standards and requirements and permit Canadian
clearing members to maintain acc membership under Canadian net capital requirements and Canadian accounting standards.77 The Commission also approved an acc proposal to issue and clear options on the Major Market Index
(XMI) fungible with those currently traded on the American Stock Exchange
(Amexf8 for trading on the European Options Exchange.

36

Options

During fiscal year 1987, the Commission issued a Rule 9b-1 order under the Exchange Act that approved proposed revisions to the Options Disclosure Document (000).79 The revised ODD, submitted by the acc in conjunction with the
Amex,Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE),
NYSE,Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx) and NASD, reflects recent changes in
the options market such as the introduction of evening trading hours in foreign
currency options and the growing international trading of options. In this regard,
the Commission approved rule changes by the Arnex and acc which enabled the
European Options Exchange to trade options on the XMI,a broad-based, priceweighted index constructed by the Arnex.80 This is the first occasion in which options that are identical to and fungible with option contracts traded on a domestic
securities exchange have traded on a foreign securities exchange.
The Commission also approved a rule change that would allow the Phlx to list
options on a narrow-based utility index comprised of the common stocks of 20
domestic companies that are involved primarily in electric power generation.81 In
addition,the Commission issued an order that approved a PSE proposal to list and
trade options on the Fmancial News Composite Index (FNCI), a broad-based
price-weighted index comprised of 30 NYSE listed stocks designed to track the
overallmarkel82 Additionally, the PSE arranged with the International Futures Exchange (Bermuda), Ltd. (Intex), a foreign commodity exchange, for Intex to trade
futures on the FNCI.Also, the PSE ceased trading options on the PSE Technology
Indexas of the September 1987 expiration.83
The Commission approved proposed rule changes submitted by the Arnex,
PhIx,and NYSE to list foreign currency warrants for trading.84 These warrants, issued by highly capitalized corporations or their affiliated finance companies, are
cash settled, exercisable before their expiration date, and have a value linked to the
value of a foreign currency.
Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission sent a letter to the CFTC not objecting to the designation of the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBT) as a contract market for the trading of stock index futures on
the Institutional Index (XII).85The XII,developed by the Arnex, is an index comprised of 75 stocks that are held by institutional investors. The Commission also
sent a letter to the CFTC not objecting to the designation of the CBT as a contract
market for the trading of futures contracts on the Long-Terrn Corporate Bond Index.86 The Long Terrn Corporate Bond Index, developed by the CBT, is composed
of 100 fixed-rete, non-convertible, publicly-offered, highly-rated, long-terrn, United
States dollar-denominated bonds issued by United States corporations with a principal value of $100 million.
In addition, the Commission sent a letter to the CFTC not objecting to the designation of the Commodity Exchange, Inc. as a contract market for the trading of
futures contracts on the Moody's Investment-Grade Corporate Bond Index.87 The
index, developed by Moody's Investors Service, is composed of 80 fixed-yield,
non-convertible, highly-rated, interrnediate and long-terrn bonds issued by United
States corporations with a principal value of at least $100 million. In response to a
CFfC request, the Commission also sent a letter to the CFTC not objecting to a
37

CFTC no-action position authorizing the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, Ltd. (SIMEX) to offer and sell stock index futures contracts based on the
Nikkei Stock Average (Nikkei) to United States citizens.88 The Nikkei is a priceweighted stock index which is calculated based on the prices of 225 highlycapitalized stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Further, the Commission amended Rule 3a12-8 under the Exchange Act to
eliminate the requirement that futures on foreign government securities be traded
on a board of trade in the country that issued those securttles.P?
As previously noted in the market volatility section, the Commission continued
to examine the effects of index-related trading strategies involving index options
and futures and the underlying component stocks both on the last trading day before expiration (so-called "Expiration Friday") and on non-expiration days in fiscal
year 1987. In addition to the rule filing involving the submission of market-on-close
orders relating to index arbitrage in 50 designated stocks.P? the Commission approved a NYSE rule change to modify the settlement price of expiring stock index
options on the NYSE Composite Index and NYSE Beta Index to the opening prices
of component stocks, rather than the closing prices, on Expiration Friday.'" The
Commission also approved a NYSE rule change implementing special stock
opening procedures designed to reduce order imbalances due to the settlement of
certain index options and futures at the opening rather than the closing of trading.92 As previously discussed, the Commission also published a staff study looking at non-expiration volatility and, in particular, the role of index-related trading
strategies in the market decline of September 11 and 12, 1986.
In fiscal year 1987, the Commission revisited the question of eliminating the
existing options allocation plan and permitting trading of exchange-listed options
on more than one exchange. In particular, the Commission authorized a proceeding under Section 19(c) of the Exchange Act to consider whether to: (1) adopt a
policy permitting multiple trading on exchange-listed stocks; and (2) amend the
rules of the options exchanges to remove restrictions on the multiple trading of options on exchange-listed stocks.?"

Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities Dealers,
and Transfer Agents
Broker-Dealer

and Transfer Agent Examinations

During fiscal year 1987, the Commission continued to make increased use of
computers in the broker-dealer regulatory programs. A new on-line system now
captures all broker-dealer examination data. This data is used to monitor the activities of the Commission's nine regional offices in carrying out the examination program goals and objectives. Additionally, software programs for the review of net
capital and mark-up compliance were developed for use in field examinations,
when portable computers become available. By the end of the fiscal year, the Commission had ordered a number of portable computers, which will become available to field examiners for conducting broker-dealer and transfer agent examinations in fiscal year 1988. Previously, a pilot test program determined that portable
computers would improve examiner productivity.
The broker-dealer oversight program continued to emphasize review of sales

38

practice activities at large national firms. These examinations included on-site reviews at both the headquarters and branch offices of the selected firms. Also, the
Commission placed greater emphasis on compliance with the currency reporting
provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act As a result, the Commission brought enforcement proceedings against several broker-dealers for failure to report cash transactions and referred matters to the Department of Treasury for possible civilor criminal action.
The Commission completed 452 oversight examinations of SRO members, a
6.0 percent decrease from the 481 examinations completed in fiscal year 1986.
This decrease was the result of an increased emphasis on comprehensive oversight examinations with an increased emphasis on sales practice reviews.As a result, despite the decrease in the number of completed oversight examinations, the
Commission increased the amount of time spent on the oversight examination
program by 3.3 percent The Commission also completed 56 cause examinations,
a decrease from the 69 conducted in fiscal year 1986. The decrease in cause examinations has resulted from the Commission's determination to place greater reliance on the SROs to handle matters for which they have adequate remedies.
In addition, the Commission also reviewed several broker-dealers to examine
their procedures for limiting access to market-sensitive information within multiservice firms. This "Chinese wall" inspection revealed that each firm used a different approach to control the flow of inside information through the Chinese wall.
The Commission concluded that the firms would benefit by setting clearer minimum standards in several areas. Consequently, the NYSE agreed to include supervision of its members' Chinese walls in its regular examination program and the
Commission plans to aid in the development of an examination module and provide oversight of NYSE examinations.
The Commission also conducted 111 transfer agent examinations, an increase
of 2.8 percent from the 108 examinations conducted in fiscal year 1986. These examinations were conducted following guidelines set by the Commission which are
designed to improve examination selection and to follow-up on deficiencies noted
in prior examinations.
Market Sweeps

In September 1987, the Commission approved issuance of a release soliciting
comments on proposed Rules 13e-2 and 14d-1 under the Exchange Act which
would govern certain acquisitions of securities undertaken during and shortly after
a conventional tender offer for securities of the same class and related actlvities.?"
If adopted, the proposed rules would apply to purchases, offers to purchase, arrangements or understandings to purchase and solicitations of offers to sell securities that are the subject of the tender offer. Ifany such transaction is undertaken
during and shortly after a tender offer and would increase any person's beneficial
ownership of the class of securities subject to the tender offer by 10 percent or
more of the class, the transaction must be made in compliance with the statutory
provisions and rules applicable to tender offers. Exceptions would be provided for:
(l) purchases of blocks which had been reported to the Commission for one year;
(2) purchases from the issuer; (3) purchases pursuant to a pre-existing written

39

agreement; (4) issuer transactions approved by security holder vote, including recapitalizations and reorganizations; and (5) purchases in connection with mergers
approved by the issuer's security holders. The provisions would apply to all persons from the formal commencement of a tender offer until 1 business days after
the scheduled expiration date.

°

Short Sales
On May 20, 1987, the Commission issued a release soliciting comments on proposed Rule lOb-21 under the Exchange Act. 95 If adopted, the rule would prohibit
a person who effects short sales of an equity security during the period between the
filing of a registration statement relating to the same class of equity securities and
the commencement of the public offering of such equity securities from directly or
indirectly covering such short sales with securities purchased from an underwriter
or broker or dealer participating in the public offering. The proposed rule is designed to prevent manipulative short selling by market participants in anticipation
of underwritten public offerings.
Bank Securities Activities
On May 4, 1987, the Commission submitted to Congress proposed legislation
entitled the Bank Broker-Dealer Act of 1987. The Bank Broker-Dealer Act, introduced in both the House of Representatlves'f and the Senate.'" would modify the
blanket exceptions for "banks" found in the definitions of "broker" and "dealer,"
and would remove the exemption for banks that engage in any of the activities enumerated in Rule 3b-9 under the Exchange Act. The Bank Broker-Dealer Act would
expressly require banks that fall within the definitions of "broker" or "dealer" to establish separate entities registered as broker-dealers with the Commission,
through which securities activities would be carried out
The proposed legislation is intended to codify the concepts first presented in
Rule 3b-9, which the Commission adopted on July 1, 1985.98 The rule would have
required banks to conduct certain securities activities through broker-dealers registered under the Exchange Act. These activities are: (l) public solicitation of brokerage for transaction-related compensation, (2) receipt of transaction-related
compensation for providing brokerage services for trust, managing agency, or
other accounts to which the bank provides advice, or (3) dealing in or underwriting
securities. The rule also contains several exceptions for banks that conduct only
limited securities activities. On November 4, 1986, the rule was invalidated by the
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuil99In its opinion, the Court suggested that perhaps Congress should address the issue of bank broker-dealer
activities.
Zero-Coupon Securities
In April 1987, the Commission issued a release reminding broker-dealers that
the Commission's and self-regulatory organizations' (SRO) mark-up policies apply
to transactions in zero-coupon securities. J 00 The Commission issued the release
because it had become concemed about mark-up and mark-down practices that
may have developed with respect to such securities.

40

Fmancial Responsibility Rules
On June 11, 1987, the Commission amended its net capital, recordkeeping and
quarterly securities count rules in connection with the treatment of repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreements entered into by registered broker-dealers,"?' The
record-keeping rule was amended to specifically require broker-dealers to maintain certain books and records with respect to their repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, including securities records and copies of all confirmations.
The quarterly securities count rule was amended to clarify that broker-dealers are
required to account for securities that are the subjects of repurchase agreements
as they do for other securities for which they are responsible. The net capital rule
was amended to establish deductions from net worth in arriving at net capital for
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements under certain risk circumstances,
to require additional capital when the broker-dealer has attained a high degree 'of
leverage as a result of those agreements and to require deductions in connection
withtransactions with affiliates when the affiliate's records are not made available
for examination.
Customer Protection Rule
On August 6, 1987, the Commission amended its customer protection rule, effective January 31, 1988, in connection with repurchase agreements where the
broker-dealer agrees to retain custody of the securities that are subject to those
agreements. I 02 The amendments to the rule willrequire registered broker-dealers
to obtain repurchase agreements in writing, to make specific disclosures regarding
certain risks associated with hold-in-custody repurchase transactions and to disclose that the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) has taken the position that coverage under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 is not
available to repurchase agreement participants. The amendments further require
registered broker-dealers to maintain possession or control of securities subject to
hold-in-custody repurchase agreements, except that possession or control during
the trading day is not required if certain conditions are met
Interpretations of the Customer Protection Rule
On September 8, 1987, the Division issued a no-action letter to the New York
Stock Exchange Sponsored Joint Industry Rule 15c3-3 Committee regarding possession or control of customers' securities for purposes of the customer protection
rule.103 The letter permits broker-dealers to rely on the expected receipt of securities borrowed in order to process "today for tomorrow" delivery instructions for fail
to deliver requirements under certain conditions, until a permanent DTC system
designed to assist the broker-dealer community in segregating fullypaid or excess
margin securities is operational.
Lost and Stolen Securities
In 1977, the Commission instituted the Lost and Stolen Securities Program. The
Commission's designee, the Securities Information Center (SIC),maintains an upto-date database on lost, stolen and counterfeit securities. Program data for calendar year 1986 indicate the continuing utility of the program to broker-dealers,
41

banks, and investors. Program participants number just over 20,300, a three percent increase over 1985. In 1986, the dollar value of certificates that were reported
to SIC as lost, missing, stolen or counterfeit was $2.3 billion, a 15 percent increase
over 1985. As a result, the aggregate dollar value of the database increased from
$9.8 billion to $12.1 billion. The number of certificates reported as lost, stolen,
missing or counterfeit increased approximately 18 percent, from 506,223 in 1985
to 596,707 in 1986. Registered institutions also made inquiries concerning 2.5 million certificates. The number of 1986 inquiries from participants that matched previous reports of lost, missing, stolen or counterfeit securities (hits) was 596, a decrease from 1,036 in 1985. The dollar value for hits, however, increased slightly,
from $15.4 million in 1985 to $15.5 million in 1986.
Municipal Bond Redemption Processing

To improve the processing of whole-issue and partial calls of municipal securities, the Commission endorsed voluntary notification and processing guidelines
that were developed in consultation with federal regulators, self-regulatory organizations, and organizations representing municipal securities issuers, bond counsel
and securities processors. I 04
During fiscal year 1986, the number of called bonds increased fourfold, due to
declining interest rates. The voluntary guidelines are designed, among other
things, to assure that bond holders receive timely and accurate notice to redeem
their bonds.

Oversight of Self-Regulatory Organizations
National Securities Exchanges
As of September 30, 1987, nine active exchanges were registered with the Commission as national securities exchanges.l?" During the fiscal year, the Commission granted applications by exchanges to delist 88 equity and debt and 16 option
issues and granted applications by issuers requesting withdrawal from listing and
registration for 29 issues. In addition, during the fiscal year the Commission
granted 1,188 applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges.
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission instituted proceedings pursuant to
Section 19{c) of the Exchange Act to consider the adoption of a new rule for certain
exchanges and associations. The rule would place a prohibition on an exchange
listing, or an association (i.e., the NASD) authorizing for quotation the common
stock or equity securities of an issuer if,on or after May 15, 1987, the issuer issues
securities or takes other corporate action that would have the effect of nullifying,
restricting or disparately reducing the voting rights of any common stock of such
issuers.I06 As part of this proceeding, the Commission held a public hearing in
July for interested persons to present their views. The Commission decided to institute Section 19{c)proceedings after the NYSE submitted a proposal to amend
its "one share, one vote" rule to permit listed companies to issue stock with disparate voting rights if certain requirements were sattsfled.'!" Public hearings on the
rule change were held on December 16 and 17, 1986.
The Commission set aside actions by the NYSE denying two members, William
J. Higgins and Michael D. Robbins, permission to communicate by telephone from

42

the Exchange floor with non-member customers located off the floor. lOB In its
Opinion,the Commission rejected arguments by the NYSEthat it had a longstanding rule prohibiting such communication links. The Commission held that the
NYSEhad no rule, or policy enforceable as a rule, denying members the right to
have direct telephone communication from the floor with their non-member customers located off-floor and ordered the NYSE to permit Higgins and Robbins to
installthe telephone connections they had requested.
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission received 205 proposed rule changes
from the stock exchanges. The Commission approved several significant rule filings, including proposals of the NYSE and Amex to permit them to waive or modifycertain of their corporate govemance and financial disclosure listing standards
forforeign issuers that conflict with the home country's laws or practices. 109Under
the Amex and NYSE rules, such a waiver may be granted only where the practices
of the foreign companies are in compliance with business practices and legal requirements of their country of domicile.
The Commission also approved proposed rule changes of the Amex and NYSE
that eliminate certain restrictions imposed on approved persons 110which own or
control specialist units on the floor of the exchanges if the approved persons establish an organizational separation, or "Chinese wall," between its entity and the
specialist unit111 It also approved a proposed rule change by the Amex to require
specialists to accept stop orders in common stock and accept stop limit orders
where the stop and prices are not identical. 112
The Commission approved proposals by the NYSE to: (1) amend its rule pertaining to the execution of percentage orders to broaden the ability of NYSE specialists to represent percentage orders in the trading process by allowing the specialist to convert such orders into limit orders on destabilizing ticks;113and (2)
establish, on a pilot basis, a policy for reviewing certain proposed mergers and
combinations between specialist units that could, in the NYSE's view, potentially
result in concentration levels harmful to the NYSE, the quality of its markets, and
its specialist comrnumty.l!"
Finally,the Commission approved a proposal by the Cincinnati Stock Exchange
(CSE) regarding an affiliation with the CBOE.11S The affiliation provides CBOE
members access to trading on the CSE by allowing CBOE members to become
CSE members without having to purchase CSE certificates of proprietary membership. The affiliation, in part, is a result of the CBOE's desire to have access to a
stock market in the event the side-by-side trading of options and stocks is commenced.
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
The NASD,the only national securities association registered with the Commission, has over 6,600 member firms. In fiscal year 1987, the NASD reported the disposition of 415 formal and summary disciplinary actions and 194 formal and summary actions by its NASDAQ and Market Surveillance Committees.
In addition, the Commission received 46 filings of proposed rule changes from
the NASD. The Commission approved 29 proposed rule changes in fiscal year
1987. The Commission approved NASD proposals: (1) extending for a two-year
period the pilot program for the exchange of quotation information between the
43

NASD and the ISE; 116(2) establishing a NASDAQ Workstation pilot that would update terminals used in the NASDAQ marketplace by providing a state-of-the-art
workstation for NASDAQ market makers.'!" (3) amending Schedule D to the
NASD's By-Laws which governs the operation of the NASDAQ system;118 and (4)
amending the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice to regulate members' communications with the public with regard to direct participation program advertismg.!'?
The Commission also approved amendments to the NASD's Transaction Reporting Plan with respect to NASDAQlNMS Securities. The purpose of the amendments was to specify eligibility requirements, including certain corporate governance standards, that determine the NASDAQ securities that can be included in the
NMS and thus have real-time last sale reporting. The eligibility criteria were added
to Schedule D of the NASD's By-Laws. 120
Municipal Securities RUlemaking Board (MSRB)
In fiscal year 1987, the Commission received 14 proposed rule changes from the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and approved 11 MSRB rule filings. Of
particular note was the approval of an amendment of Rule G-8(a)(xi) to require
municipal securities dealers to record and maintain suitability information obtained pursuant to Rule G-19(b).
Clearing Agencies
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission received 98 proposed rule changes
from registered clearing agencies and approved 93. The Commission approved
self-regulatory organization rule changes designed to improve the transfer of customer accounts among member firms121 and clearing agency rule changes establishing automated systems for transferring customer funds and securities
among member firms. 122The Commission also approved an NSCC proposal that
established a Reorganization Processing System, which would allow, for the first
time, centralized automated netting and settlement of transactions in securities
subject to a reorganization (e.g., a tender offer). 123The Commission also approved
changes to OCe's by-laws to clarify OCe's authority, and standards for the exercise of that authority, to adjust the terms of outstanding options contracts, among
other things, for changes in securities underlying those contrects.F"
SRO Surveillance and Regulatory
Comptiancelnspectlons
During the fiscal year 1987, the Commission conducted 23 inspections of SRO
market surveillance, compliance, disciplinary and operational programs.
In fiscal year 1987, the staff completed a review of the NYSE program of formal
discipline for floor trading violations. Since the previous inspection, the NYSE has
made significant advances in its overall disciplinary program, resulting in the prosecution of more actions than in any other prior period. The inspection report noted
a need for further progress in the areas of timeliness of disciplinary actions, the determination of sanctions, case management, and document control procedures.
An inspection was conducted of systems to detect and deter insider trading at
three SROs and several broker-dealers. The staff reviewed surveillance procedures
44

for detection of insider trading at the NYSE, the Amex, and the CBOE. These systems were found to be operating effectively and additional enhancements were
being implemented to further improve surveillance capabilities. The staff also
noted that investigations resulting from surveillance procedures were generally
thorough and well-documented. Nevertheless, the Division suggested that the
SROs shorten the length of investigations. In an effort to improve the timeliness
and quality of insider trading referrals to the Commission, the Intermarket Surveillance Group formed an insider trading subgroup. This subgroup, consisting of
representatives from SROs and the Divisions of Market Regulation and Enforcement, formulated an insider trading initiative with the goal of reducing referral time
on SRO investigations, along with proposals for enhancing communication and
coordination between the SROs and the Commission. The initiative was endorsed
and the Intermarket Surveillance Group was commended by the Commission for
its efforts and response to the concems in the marketplace regarding insider
trading.
The inspection staff also visited several broker-dealers to examine their procedures for limiting access to market-sensitive information within multi-service
firms. This "Chinese wall" inspection revealed that each firm used a different approach to control the flow of inside information through the Chinese wall, but that
improvements could be made in documenting actions taken by the firm and in increasing the auditability of the process. Consequently, the NYSE agreed to include
supervision of its members' Chinese walls in its regular examination program. The
Commission plans to aid in development of an examination module and provide
oversight of NYSE examinations.
An inspection of the new NASD free-riding and withholding program revealed
significant improvement in surveillance of manipulation in newly issued securities.
InJanuary 1986, the NASD implemented new procedures for manipulation review
into its oversight of new issues. Automated surveillance systems were combined
with manual procedures and improved questionnaires to greatly enhance the prior
review procedure. Minor recommendations were made regarding follow-up on
questionnaires at the district level. Nevertheless, the NASD was commended for
vastly improved procedures.
The Commission also conducted an inspection of NASD's surveillance of nonNASDAQ over-the-counter securities (commonly known as "pink sheet" stocks).
In response to this inspection, the NASD has enhanced its "pink sheet" surveillance program by agreeing to review all non-NASDAQ issues rather than just those
cleared by the NSCC. In addition, the NASD plans to implement a rule requiring
member firms to submit information to the NASD that will aid in the surveillance
procedure.
The May 1987 inspection of the PSE revealed significant improvements in surveillance procedures and implementation of an options audit trail. Additional recommendations for improvement of PSE surveillance systems were made in some
areas.The PSE was advised to further automate options surveillance procedures
by automating trading analyses of the underlying equities. In addition, the Commission suggested increased staffing and further automation of surveillance procedures.
The Commission also completed comprehensive inspections of the surveil-

45

lance, investigatory, and disciplinary programs for options and equities at the Phlx.
In both options and equities, the inspection found that the Phlx had improved its
surveillance procedures. The inspections also found improvement in timeliness
and quality of investigations. The Commission had minor recommendations for
strengthening Phlx penalties and for the specialist performance evaluation program.
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission completed an inspection of the surveillance, investigatory and disciplinary programs of the MSE. A review of the Listing
Department was conducted as well. The MSE surveillance procedures and staffing
levels were found to be satisfactory and minor recommendations were made regarding improvement in documentation of investigations and disciplinary actions.
In addition, enhancements to surveillance procedures and Listing Department operations were advised.
An inspection of the CSE revealed adequate surveillance and compliance programs. However, due to increasing trading volume, improvements were recommended in the areas of documentation of daily surveillance and investigatory activity and informal disciplinary actions for minor CSE rule violations.
A comprehensive inspection of CBOE's surveillance and disciplinary program
for trading violations was conducted in fiscal year 1987. The Commission found
that the CBOE's three-year surveillance automation project was proceeding on
schedule and promised to permit the surveillance program to keep pace with the
CBOE's increasing options trading volume. The Commission made recommendations for enhancements to existing surveillance procedures and advised the
CBOE to increase the severity of sanctions in appropriate cases of recidivist
violations.
The Commission conducted a comprehensive inspection of the Amex. Specifically, the inspection focused on four major program areas: (l) routine options
sales practices examinations of those firms for which the Amex is the designated
options examining authority; (2) investigations of customer complaints, terminations of registered representatives for cause and firms' notices of disciplinary actions; (3) processing of formal disciplinary actions resulting from examinations
and investigations; and (4) examinations and financial surveillance of those firms
conducting a public business for which the Amex is the designated examining authority under Rule 17d-1 of the Exchange Act. Overall, the inspection disclosed
that the Amex regulatory programs are functioning satisfactorily. The Commission
did note delays in processing disciplinary actions as well as isolated deficiencies in
the Amex's examinations and investigations of members' options sales practices.
The Commission conducted an inspection of the NYSE's handling of referrals
(typically, customer complaints) from the Commission. The inspection disclosed
that the initial processing of the referrals by the Customer Complaint Department
was being handled satisfactorily. However, the inspection found deficiencies in investigations conducted by the Department of Enforcement. The NYSE represented that significant increases in staff would be made and that procedural and
organizational changes were being made to improve the timeliness and quality
of investigation of all cause matters, including those cases referred by the
Commission.
The Commission also conducted an inspection of the MSE's broker-dealer ex-

46

amination, financial surveillance and formal disciplinary action programs, as well
as the handling of customer complaints and Regulation T extension requests. The
Commission concluded that the MSE is ensuring members' compliance with the
federal securities laws in a satisfactory manner and is conducting effective regulatory programs with respect to MSE member firms. Minor deficiencies in the Regulation T and financial surveillance program were noted.
The Commission also conducted inspections of eight of the fourteen NASD district offices. Inspections of the district offices in California, Denver, Dallas, Atlanta,
Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York were conducted by the Commission's regional offices. As in prior years, the Commission noted isolated deficiencies in the districts' financial surveillance routine examination, cause investigation
and formal disciplinary action programs. Nevertheless, the NASD district office inspections generally revealed that the NASD was satisfactorily meeting its oversight
responsibilities under the Exchange Act. In particular, the Commission noted significant improvements in the district office in New York as a result of management
and procedural changes. In addition, the Commission met with the NYSE and the
NASD on a quarterly basis to discuss current regulatory, examination and oversight issues.
The staff completed a comprehensive review of securities industry sponsored
arbitration that reflected the Commission's belief in the need for thorough oversight of SRO arbitration systems. The review found that while securities industry arbitration generally operates fairly, the process can be improved in a number of respects. Major recommendations regarding the operation of SRO arbitration
systems have been sent to members of the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration, the group that drafted the rules under which SRO arbitration operates.l'"
The Commission's principal recommendations were that (1) SROs establish standards for who may serve as a public arbitrator, (2) make publicly available summary data on the results of arbitrations, (3) adopt improved discovery procedures,
(4) review arbitrator disclosure provisions, (5) implement effective arbitrator training programs, (6) institute arbitrator evaluation programs, and (7) explore flexible
rules for large cases. The SROs have been asked to respond to the recommendations in fiscal year 1988.

Applications for Re-entry
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission received 103 SRO applications to permit persons subject to statutory disqualifications, as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of
the Exchange Act, to become or remain associated with broker-dealers. The distribution of filings among the SROs was the following: NASD (89); NYSE (12); and
Amex (2). Of the total filings processed, 8 applications were subsequently withdrawn, 99 were completed, and 4 were pending at year-end.F" The Commission
refused to take a no-action position in two applications.
As part of the review of SRO arbitration, the Commission examined the operation of the NASD's arbitration program. In addition to the recommendations set
out above, the Commission recommended that the NASD improve the turnaround times of its cases. Discussions with the NASD on appropriate changes to
its program should conclude in fiscal year 1988.

47

SRO Final Disciplinary Actions
Section 19(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 19d-l thereunder require all self-regulatory organizations to file notice with the Commission of
all final disciplinary actions.
A Rule 19d-1 filing reports a completed action that may have been initiated at
any time during the previous years. The duration of a SRO action frequently reflects the severity of the violations(s) charged, the number of respondents involved,
and the complexity of the underlying facts. SROs generally conclude cases involving minor or techincal violations with a single respondent in less than a year; cases
involving serious trading violations (e.g., price manipulation, prearranged trading,
front-running, etc.) require more time to complete because of the necessity to
demonstrate specific intent to the disciplinary panel that acts as a trier of fact Consequently, the volume of Rule 19d-l notices submitted by a SRO in a given year is
not a precise measure of its proficiency in market surveillance and compliance.
Nevertheless, the number of actions reported can be useful in assessing the regulatory effectiveness of different SROs over similar time periods, and this information has proved useful in focusing inspections of SRO regulatory programs.
In fiscal 1987 the American Stock Exchange filed 44 Rule 19d-l reports, the
Chicago Board Options Exchange filed 145; the New York Stock Exchange ftled
128; the Philadelphia Stock Exchange filed 11; the Pacific Stock Exchange filed
50; the Boston Stock Exchange filed none; the Midwest Stock Exchange filed 4;
and the National Association of Securities Dealers filed 609.

During fiscal year 1987, the number of registered investment companies increased by 13 percent and the assets they manage increased by 62 percent The
number of investment advisers registered increased by 8 percent and the assets
they manage increased by 199 percent
The number of investment company and investment adviser examinations
completed during fiscal year 1987 exceeded 2,000 for the first time. almost double
the number completed in fiscal year 1982.
During fiscal year 1987, the Division and the regional offices continued efforts to
coordinate their regulatory activities with state authorities that share the Commission's jurisdiction over investment advisers, by conducting joint examinations, providing training for state examiners, and routinely sharing examination results.
The Commission staff is preparing a report on the fmancial planner industry, requested in July 1986 by Congressmen Timothy E. Wirth and Matthew J. Rinaldo of
the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee
on Telecommunications. Consumer Protection and Finance. The report will focus on the financial planning industry's customer
demographics,
planner characteristics,
compensation, registration, inspection, and the National Association of Securities
Dealers' (NASD) pilot project to inspect investment advisers who are also NASD
members.

49

In June 1987, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Securities
Dealers passed a resolution to take steps to become a self-regulatory organization
with jurisdiction over the investment advising activities of its members and affiliates
who are investment advisers. The Commission will consider the NASD proposal in
greater detail after the related report on the financial planning industry is completed.
The Division's Office of the Chief Counsel coordinated the Division's work on a
number of Commission-wide special projects and legislative initatives, including
the Commission's internationalization and bank guarantee studies.
Disclosure Requirements
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission reproposed for comment Form N-7, a
simplified form under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Investment Company Act for all unit investment trusts other than insurance company
separate eccounts.V" The Commission proposed for comment Rule 24f-3 under
the Investment Company Act, which would provide a simplified method for unit investment trusts to pay securities registration fees imposed under the Securities
Act 128 In addition, the Commission adopted an amendment to Regulation S-X to
require that registered investment companies account for net costs incurred under
a Rule 12b-1 plan as an expense.F? The amendment provides for uniform accounting treatment so that investors may more accurately compare investment results and expense ratios among investment companies. An amendment to Form
N-SAR, the semi-annual report filed by investment companies, was proposed that
would conforrn the form's change-of-accountant
disclosure requirements to
those of Form 8-K under the Exchange Act130
The Commission also proposed amendments to Form N-1A, the registration
form for mutual funds to provide for a consolidated table of expenses (fee table)
near the front of the prospectus.P' The fee table is intended to assist investors in
comparing expenses among mutual funds.
EDGAR
In July 1985, the Office of Public Utility Regulation began accepting electronic
filings from registered public utility holding company systems and their member
companies. An EDGAR Pilot Branch was forrned in October 1985, which began
processing electronic filings for a volunteer group of investment company registrants in November 1985. The volunteers include a representative group of 184
management investment companies and 77 unit investment trusts with over 2,700
active series. Electronic filings on Form N-SAR, the semi-annual report of registered investment companies, also were made by 700 registered management investment companies not participating full-time in the EDGAR Pilot As of Septem30, 1987, the Commission received 16,368 investment company filings
throug
e EDGAR Pilot Branch.
In March 1987, the Commission adopted a temporary rule and form to allow optional electronic filing of Form 13F, the report of securities holdings filed by institutional managers. The rule specifies a uniform format and requires that electronic
filings of this form be made on magnetic tape. These electronic filings, which

50

should facilitate tabulation of 13F data, are expected to begin in November 1987,
for the quarter ended September 30, 1987.
Regulatory Policy
In November 1986, the Commission adopted an amendment to Rule 31a-2 under the Investment Company Act to permit investment companies to maintain required records on magnetic tape, disk, or other computer storage media, in recognition of the greater use of computers in the industry.132
In December 1986, the Commission proposed Rule 11a-3 under the Investment
Company Act, which would permit, under specified conditions, a mutual fund or its
principal underwriter to make an exchange offer to the fund's own shareholders or
to shareholders of another fund in the same family of funds. At the same time, the
Commission proposed Rule 11c-l under the Investment Company Act which
would conditionally permit a unit investment trust or its sponsor to make exchange
offers to certain unit holders.
In June 1987, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 19b-1 under the
Investment Company Act, which restricts registered investment companies to
making one distribution of long-term capital gains for anyone tax year, plus a supplemental distribution not exceeding ten percent of the prior distribution. The
amendments, which were adopted in final form in October 1987, permit investment companies to make one additional distribution of longterm capital gains for
anyone tax year where the distribution is made to avoid the assessment of an excise tax on the investment company under the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
In October 1987, the Commission adopted Rule 6c-9, which provides an exemption from the Investment Company Act for foreign banks selling their own debt securities or non-voting preferred stock in the United States. The rule also applies to
the sale of those securities by a foreign bank's finance subsidiary.
Investment Advisers
The Commission adopted Rule 206(4)-4 under the Investment Advisers Act,
which codifies an investment adviser's fiduciary obligation to give material financial and disciplinary information to c1ients.133
The Commission also issued Investment Advisers Act Release No. 1092, which
sets forth uniform interpretations of federal and state investment adviser laws as
they apply to financial planners and other persons. Developed jointly by the Commission's staff and the North American Securities Administrators Association,lnc.,
the release revised Investment Advisers Act Release No. 770 issued in August
1981. Among other things, it clarifies the definition of investment adviser as applied to financial planners and discusses the staffs view that an adviser's duty to
disclose material facts includes the duty to disclose the various capacities in which
the adviser might act when dealing with a particular client.
Insurance Products
One exemptive rule under the Investment Company Act has been proposed,
and another adopted on a temporary basis, to facilitate the process under the se51

curities laws of bringing new variable insurance products to the marketplace. In
March 1987, a new approach to exemptive relief for the deduction of mortality and
expense risk charges from the assets of life insurance company separate accounts
was introduced in the reproposal of Rule 200-3. In May 1987, a new round of
amendments to Rule 6e-3(T) became effective, essentially codifying relief granted
in individual exemptive orders over the last several years, and updating the rule to
reflect the latest features of flexible premium product designs.
In June 1987, the Commission issued a notice of the filing of an application by
the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF) and The Teachers Insurance and
AnnuityAssociation of America for an order granting exemptions from certain sections of the Investment Company Act and approving certain transactions in order
to allow CREF to continue to operate as it had before agreeing to register as an investment company. A number of requests for a hearing were filed before the expiration of the notice period by CREF participants, colleges and universities, and
mutual fund complexes. Several hearing requests were also filed on CREPs request for temporary exemptive relief pending the outcome of any hearing that
might be ordered on its exemptive application.
Public GtiBly Holding Companies
There are now 13 registered public utility holding company systems with aggregate assets, as of June 30, 1987, of $873 billion, an increase of $43 billion, or 52
percent over June 3D, 1986. Total operating revenues, as of June 3D, 1987, were
$31.9 billion, a $2.0 billion decrease from June 3D, 1986. There are 68 electric or
gas utility subsidiaries, 73 non-utility subsidiaries, and 24 inactive companies in
the 13 registered systems, a total of 178 companies operating in 24 states (excluding seven power supply subsidiary companies).
InJune 1987, the Commission published for comment a proposed amendment
to Rule 45 under the Holding Company Act. The proposed amendment would
make unnecessary the fIling of declarations for orders of the Commission approving routine agreements where a parent company in a registered holding company
system guarantees, assumes joint liability upon, or acts as surety or indemnitor for
the obligations of its subsidiary company. Comments received have indicated that
substantial savings will inure to consumers and shareholders by the adoption of
the proposed rule amendment
HoLdingCompany Financing~uring
fiscal year 1987, the Commission authorized $6.3 billion of senior securities and common stock financing for the 13
registered systems: $5.0 billion in long-term debt financing, with $13 billion in
common and preferred stock. Long-term debt financing decreased by 343 percent from fiscal year 1986, primarily due to an increase in long-term interest rates,
which reduced the economic incentives to refinance. In addition, approximately
$430 million in pollution control financing and $5.5 billion in short-term debt financing were approved. The pollution control fmancing was a 61 percent decrease
from amounts authorized in fiscal year 1986. Short-term debt increased by 43 percent over the previous year. Total financings in fiscal year 1987 of $123 billion were
less than financings authorized in fiscal year 1986 by $3.4 billion, a decrease of
21.9 percent The Middle South Utilities, Inc. system accounted for approximately
52

15 percent of the total financing authorized under the Holding Company Act. The
Commission also authorized over $1 billion for fuel exploration and development
activities during fiscal year 1987. Substantial expenditures in fuel procurement
were incurred through the acquisition of $546 million of nuclear fuel and over
$380 million in coal mining equipment and refinancing.
The Commission's continuing review of holding company fuel procurement activities, accounting policies, audits of service companies and annual reports of the
subsidiary service companies and fuel procurement subsidiaries, and the review of
quarterly reports by non-utility subsidiaries resulted in savings to consumers during fiscal year 1987 of approximately $45.0 million.
The Commission required electric subsidiaries of public utility holding companies to credit revenues from their selling excess oil and gas ($32 million), and subleasing coal and oil barges ($13 million) to their fuel costs, reducing consumer
electric bills.

Significant App6cations And Interpretations
Investment Company Act-The
Commission authorized ML-Lee Acquisition
Fund, LP., a limited partnership regulated as a business development company
under the Investment Company Act, to make joint purchases with its investment
adviser of so-called "mezzanine securities" (subordinated debt and preferred stock
with equity participation) issued in connection with leveraged buyouts. ML-Lee Acquisition Fund is the first leveraged buyout investment company made available to
retail investors. Its investment policies prohibit the fund from providing financing
for hostile takeovers.
Applications of FmHA Trust and ED Trust were filed by private parties on behalf
of trusts established to acquire loans made by the Farmers Home Administration
of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education. Exemptive
orders under the Investment Company Act were granted for the FmHA Trust on
August 24, and for the ED Trust on September 18. The FmHA Trust and the ED
Trust are collateralized by non-recourse loans originated by the respective agencies being sold as part of the federal govemment's pilot loan asset sales program.
An application filed by the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation was granted to exempt specified trusts it had established from most of the provisions of the Investment Company Act in connection with the public sale of certificates representing trust participation interests. Each trust will hold a single note
guaranteed by the Rural Electrification Administration evidencing loans used to refinance borrowings from the Federal Fmancing Bank
Holding Company Act-The
Commission
authorized Consolidated Natural
Gas Company (Consolidated),
a registered holding company, to form a new,
wholly-owned, gas marketing subsidiary, CNG Trading Company (CNG Trading),
to engage in the marketing of low cost, non-regulated gas supplies.P" CNG Trading will purchase, pool, transport, exchange, store and sell gas supplies from competitively priced sources, including the spot markets, independent producers and
brokers, as well as from Consolidated system producing affiliates, CNG Development Company and CNG Producing Company.
The Commission authorized Middle South Utilities, Inc. (MSU), a registered
53

holding company, and its wholly-owned generating subsidiary, System Energy Resources, Inc. (formerly Middle South Energy, Inc.), to guarantee potential rate refunding obligations of Mississippi Power & Ught Company (MP&L),an operating
subsidiary of MSU.135 The guarantees were needed to obtain a bond to maintain a
stay pending MP&L's appeal to the United States Supreme Court in the case of
Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. State of Mississippi.

Central and South West Corporation (CSW), a registered holding company, and
its wholly-owned subsidiary, CSW Credit, Inc. (CSW Credit) (collectively, Companies), was authorized to factor accounts receivable of the CSW electric utilitycompanies.136 Related financing was also approved. CSW Credit was also authorized
by the Commission in July 1986, to purchase receivables of nonassociate electric
utility companies, subject to the condition that the average amount of such purchases during any twelve-month period would be less than the corresponding
amount of associate company receivables. Related financing was also authorized.
The Companies are now requesting the removal of the limitation imposed by the
1986 order upon the factoring of nonassociate electric utility receivables by CSW
Credit.
The Commission authorized Wisconsin Energy Corporation to acquire all of the
common stock of the Wisconsin Electric Power Company and the Wisconsin Natural Gas Company, and exempted it from all provisions of the Holding Company
Act except Sections 9(a)(2), subject to certain condittons.P? Requests for a hearing were denied; however, jurisdiction was reserved on the retention of gas properties along with electric properties.
In a letter dated March 5, 1987, the Division stated it was unable to concur in the
opinion of counsel for Noverco, Inc. (Noverco) that the acquisition by Noverco of
the limited partnership interests of the limited partners in Energy Future Limited
Partnership (EFLP) would not require prior approval by the Commission under
Sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of the Holding Company Act EFLP is the owner of all of
the voting securities of New England Gas Corporation (NNEG). NNEG, in turn,
owns all of the voting securities of Vermont Gas Systems, Inc. (VGS), a small gas
utility incorporated and operating in Vermont. Based upon the facts and circumstances, the Commission was unable to conclude that the transaction would not
constitute an indirect acquisition by Noverco of 5% or more of the voting securities
of NNEG, and hence ofVGS. Noverco is already an affiliate of a Canadian gas utility
company.
In a letter dated June 18, 1987, to Central and South West Corporation (CSW), a
registered holding company, the Commission refused to assure CSW that itwould
not recommend any enforcement action to the Commission under the Holding
Company Act should a trust, funded by CSW, acquire shares of a non-affilated
electric utilityeven though CSW would agree (1) not to acquire the shares from the
trust without prior Commission approval under Section 9(a) of the Holding Company Act; and (2) to dispose of the shares held by the trust if approval for CSW to
acquire them was denied or not received within a specified period. In the Commission's view,the acquisition by such a trust would constitute an indirect acquisition
by CSW of public utility securities and would be unlawful under Section 9(a)(1) unless approved in advance by the Commission under Section 10.
Institutional Disclosure Program-Securities
Exchange Act Section 13(f)(1)
54

and Rule 13f-1 require specified "institutional investment managers" to file quarterly reports on Form BE As noted above, under Rule 13f-2 (T), effective July 1,
1987, these managers may file the report on Form 13F-E through magnetic tape
by using the Commission's pilot electronic disclosure system, EDGAR.Managers
filingthese reports disclose specified equity holdings of the accounts over which
they exercise investment discretion. As of June 30, 1987, Form 13F reports had
been filed by 1,683 managers for holdings totaling $1.375 trillion.
Form 13F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public Reference Room promptly after filing. Two tabulations of the information contained in
these reports are available for inspection: (1) an alphabetical list of the individual
securities, showing the number of shares held by the managers reporting the holding;and (2) a list with the total number of shares of a security reported by all reporting managers. Both tabulations normally are available two weeks after the date on
which the reports must be filed.
The tabulations are prepared by a independent contractor selected through the
competitive bidding process. The contractor provides its services to the Commission without charge, and is required to make a variety of specified tabulations available to the public at reasonable prices within ten days after receiving the reports.

•• State Courts and Administrative Tribunals.

The General Counsel represents the Commission in all litigation in the United
States Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals, defends the Commission and its
employees when sued, prosecutes administrative disciplinary proceedings against
securities professionals, and appears amicus curiae on behalf of the Commission
in significant private litigation involving the federal securities laws. In addition, under the supervision and direction of the General Counsel, the regional offices represent the Commission in corporate reorganization cases under the Bankruptcy
Code that have a substantial public investor interest The General Counsel also
analyzes legislation that would amend the federal securities laws or otherwise affect the Commission's work and prepares legislative comments and congressional
testimony. In addition, the General Counsel reviews proposed Commission action
to ensure that enforcement and regulatory programs are consistent with the Commission's statutory authority.
The General Counsel represented the Commission in 304 litigation matters in
fiscal year 1987. During the year, 36 court of appeals and Supreme Court cases
were concluded, all but three favorably to the Commission. There were 16 appeals
in Commission injunctive actions, six of which were concluded, with only one outcome unfavorable to the Commission. By comparison, the General Counsel handled 285 litigation matters in fiscal year 1986, including 18 appeals in injunctive actions. Seven such appeals were concluded in 1986, with only two outcomes
unfavorable to the Commission.
In fiscal year 1987, there also were 23 appellate and district court actions seeking
to overtum Commission orders in administrative proceedings or affirming selfregulatory organization disciplinary proceedings against securities professionals.
Of these appeals, ten were concluded, with only one adverse result Eight such actions were concluded in fiscal year 1986, with no adverse results.
The Commission participated as amicus curiae in 46 cases during the year,
compared to 42 such cases in fiscal year 1986. Itparticipated in nine private cases
that were decided, only one of which resulted in a decision adverse to the Commission.
The General Counsel also handled more than 217 other proceedings before the
Commission or in the federal district courts. These included 56 suits brought

56

against the Commission or its staff, and 86 suits seeking access to Commission
documents, including actions under various public information statutes. Of the latter, 78 suits involved discovery subpoenas in private actions where the Commission is not a party. In fiscal year 1986 there were 24 suits brought against the Commission or its staff and 54 suits (including 46 third-party subpoenas) under the
various public information statutes.
During fiscal year 1987, 94 debtors with publicly-held securities registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) commenced Chapter 11 reorganizations. The Commission entered its appearance in 32 of these cases, which
involved assets of $22.6 billion and nearly 380,000 public investors. The largest of
these proceedings was that of Texaco, Inc., with $18.3 billion in assets and about
275,000 public investors. The 32 Chapter 11 cases are set forth in Table 38 of the
Appendix to this report.
In addition to litigation, the General Counsel is involved in significant legislatiVe
and regulatory work. For example, the office assisted the Chairman and the Commissioners in preparing testimony on a number of important issues, such as the
Commission's insider trading program and development of a definition of insider
trading; securities laws aspects of the sale of federal government loan assets; regulation of corporate takeovers; and the proposed Agricultural Credit Act of 1987,
which would provide for the creation of securities backed by pooled Farmers
Home Administration loans. The office also assisted the Commission in preparing
a legislative proposal to amend the Exchange Act to permit the Commission to
regulate certain brokerage activities of banks.
Utigation
Appeals In Commission EnforcementActions-This
litigation consists of appeals of district court decisions in Commission injunctive actions. In most cases,
the defendants ask a court of appeals to reverse a district court's finding of securitiesviolations and its order enjoining future violations or providing for other relief
such as disgorgement of illegal profits, The Commission also may appeal when it
is denied relief.
InSEC v. Bums, 138 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district court decision that a company's chief executive violated a Commission rule prohibiting participants in a stock distribution from purchasing that
stock during the distribution. The defendant had provided two corporate officers
with company funds to buy stock during the distribution. He argued that he did not
violatethe rule because some of the purchases had been made before the registration statement was filed and hence before the "distribution" commenced, and because the remaining purchases were made after the distribution was completed.
The court held that a distribution of securities may commence whenever there is
an incentive to influence the market artificially,even before a registration statement
is filed. Because the defendant had such an incentive in this case, the purchases
took place during a distribution. Moreover, the court held that any inducement to
purchase securities during the distribution period violates the rule, even if the actual purchase is made outside that period. The court also affirmed the district
court's decision that the defendant acted with scienter when the company improperly inflated its revenues in fmancial statements filed with the Commission.

57

The Commission has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit a district court decision refusing to enter an injunction, on
First Amendment grounds, against a magazine publisher for violating the touting
disclosure provision of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). In SEC v. Wall
Street Publishing Institute, lnc., 139 the Commission had requested an injunction
to require a publisher to disclose that drafts of articles promoting securities of
companies were supplied by those companies. The Commission argued that such
an injunctive order, written in the language of the statute, is a valid way to enforce
an antifraud provision, and thus is not an impermissible prior restraint of the press.
In SEC v. The American Board of Trade, Inc; 140 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a district court decision to appoint a receiver
for the defendant companies and their affiliates. The court had previously issued
two decisions in this litigation holding that the defendants were illegally selling corporate notes issued by one of the defendant cornpanies.I"! and that the defendants could not effect registration of the notes because the defendants were unable
to provide required certified financial statements.I''"
Finally, the positions of the Commission were affirmed without opinion in two
cases. In SEC v. Charles Byers, 143 the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit affirmed a district court decision ordering that all of the proceeds of illegal
securities sales be distributed to all defrauded investors on a pro rata basis, rather
than imposing a constructive trust on some of the proceeds in favor of certain investors. In SEC v. Zoe Products, lnc., 144 the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's entry of summary judgment for the Commission, finding that the company and its chief executive officer acted with scienter
when they recklessly misstated facts concerning the company's financial condition
and future business prospects.
Petitions to Review Commission Orders-Petitions to courts of appeals for judicial review of Commission orders arise from administrative proceedings conducted under various provisions of the federal securities laws. These proceedings
include Commission review of disciplinary actions by national securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), which
often involve interpretative issues central to the Commission's own enforcement
program and thus to the integrity of the securities markets.
During fiscal year 1987, petitions for review were filed in several cases where the
Commission proceeded against broker-dealers for underwriting violations. In Cli.
Carlson, Inc. and Charles E. Carlson v. SEC, 145 a broker-dealer and its president
have requested review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
of a Commission decision imposing sanctions for fraudulently closing a "part-ornone" public offering. Petitioners, without disclosure to purchasers, personally
bought the final twelve percent of the shares needed to close the offering, financed
the purchases in large part with loans arranged from persons with a financial interest in the offering, and then repaid the loans with money obtained from the proceeds of the offering. The Commission had ruled that these transactions defrauded public investors by vitiating the part-or-none condition on which they had
relied.
Similarly, in Lowell H. Ustrom & Co. v. SEC, 146 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the Commission's determination that a

58

broker-dealer violated Exchange Act recordkeeping, confirmation, and creditextension regulations in connection with "best-efforts" underwritings.ln affirming
the Commission's decision, the court gave substantial deference to the Commission's interpretation of its own rules. The court also agreed with the Commission's
finding that the broker-dealer, by paying for the securities of certain customers in
the underwritings, had extended credit to those customers in violation of the Exchange Act.
A third case, pending before the District of Columbia Circuit, seeks review of a
Commission decision upholding NASD sanctions imposed on principals of a
broker-dealer for concealing their purchases of approximately one million shares
in a "best efforts, all-or-none" public offering. In Sva/berg v. SEC, consolidated
with Lippitt v. SEC, 147 petitioners argue that their purchases were immaterial, that
they acted without scienter, and that the Commission abused its discretion in affirming their sanctions. The Commission argues that the purchases were material
and that petitioners' conduct constituted knowing or reckless misrepresentation in
connection with the purchase of securities. Moreover, an underwriter's undisclosed actions to complete an otherwise unsuccessful ali-or-none offering are
fraudulent.
Review has been sought in two cases where the Commission held that securities
professionals failed to determine whether sales were part of an unregistered distribution. For example, in Butcher & Singer, Inc. and Thomas A. Grey v. SEC, 148 the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the Commission's determination that a broker-dealer violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act by failing to conduct an inquiry into the need for registration when one of
the firm's salesmen sought to sell, through the firm, a large amount of a Iittleknown stock he owned. The Commission had found a breakdown in the firm's
compliance procedures because the trader who sold the salesman's stock did not
make a thorough inquiry into the need for registration or delegate that responsiblity to someone else within the firm.
Similarly, in Kane v. SEC, 149 a registered representative of a broker-dealer seeks
review of a Commission order suspending him from association with any brokerdealer for six months because of his participation in the sale of unregistered securities. The Commission argues that the petitioner was responsible for determining
whether the securities could be sold without registration, and that he failed to make
the "searching inquiry" necessary for this determination. The Commission contends that the sanction imposed on the petitioner, which the court may reverse only
for gross abuse of discretion, was not too severe, and is appropriate to deter Kane
and others from such violations in the future.
The severity of a sanction imposed by the Commission is frequently challenged.
In Kuznetz v. SEC, 150 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld a Commission order barring petitioner from association with any
broker or dealer based on a finding that he defrauded customers by making false
and misleading representations about a company's stock Petitioner had argued
that the Commission failed to specify its reasons for increasing the sanction recommended by the administrative law judge and abused its discretion when it
barred him from association with a broker or dealer. In upholding the sanction, the
Court pointed to the Commission's findings that petitioner had extensive experi-

59

ence in the securities business, that he had engaged in serious misconduct over
the course of a year, and that he must have been aware that there was no reasonable basis for his recommendations to his customers.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed
the Commission's imposition of a six-month suspension in Dirks v. SEc.151 The
sanction was levied pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970
(SIPA)after the Commission found that petitioner was negligent when he failed to
take appropriate action in response to wamings that the brokerage firm of which
he was general partner was in precarious financial condition. The Commission
found that his negligence contributed to the firm's insolvency and subsequent liquidation. Petitioner argued that the sanction provision of SIPA,which authorizes the
Commission to impose sanctions if "in the public interest", is unconstitutionally
vague. The Court, however, found that when Congress directs an agency to act in
the public interest, it is the agency's job to define that standard. In this case, the
Commission had given petitioner fair warning of what conduct was proscribed because a prior administrative opinion had announced the use of a negligence standard for sanctions under SIPA.
Petitioners in Blinder, Robinson & Co. and Meyer Blinder v. SEC, 152 also pending before the District of Columbia Circuit, make a broad attack on, among other
things, the Commission's sanction determinations. The Commission had suspended a broker-dealer's registration for 45 days, limited the firm's underwriting
activities for two years, and barred its president from association with any brokerdealer-provided that he may reapply for association after two years. The Commission proceeding was based on the entry of an injunction against petitioners in
a prior Commission civil action and on the findings of violations made in that action. Petitioners argue that the Commission employs a "double standard" in sanctioning broker-dealers based on whether they are affiliated with the New YorkStock
Exchange (NYSE). The Commission's order imposing sanctions found that, in
light of petitioners' serious and repeated violations and their regulatory history, the
sanctions were well within the Commission's discretion.
In the same case, petitioners also attack the Commission enforcement action
that was the basis for the administrative proceeding. They argue that the formal
order authorizing the investigation violated the Fourth Amendment The Commission responds that, since a formal order is neither a search nor a seizure, the Fourth
Amendment does not apply. Separately, petitioners argue that it is a violation of
due process for the Commission to litigate an injunctive action in district court and
then initiate an administrative proceeding to impose sanctions for the same conduct. 153 The Commission argues that it is well-established that administrative
agencies may combine investigatory, prosecutorial and adjudicative functions.
Moreover, there is no due process violation where an independent decision maker
-a federal court-decides that petitioners have violated the securities laws, and
the Commission subsequently makes a separate determination of whether the
public interest requires a limitation upon petitioners' participation in the securities
business.
Petitioners also have sought judicial review of Commission orders in a variety of
other contexts. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the Commission's order in Pagel, Inc. v. SEC, 154 where the Commis60

sion had found that, through the use of nominee accounts and other manipulative
devices, a broker-dealer and certain of its affiliates had unlawfully manipulated the
market price of common stock issued in connection with the first public offering of
an unseasoned research and development company.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is currently considering
a petition to review the Commission's order in Rutherford v. SEC. 155In that case,
the Commission had affirmed a two-month bar imposed by the NYSE against the
petitioner for deliberately lying on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry
Registration in response to two questions concerning arrests and convictions. Petitioner insists, among other things, that there is no public interest in imposing a
sanction since his arrests and conviction were not securities-related. The Commission contends that the sanction was not imposed on petitioner because of his arrest and conviction record, but because he deceived the NYSE. Therefore, it was in
the public interest to sanction him to deter future acts of deception.
Finally, in Newell v. SEC, 156the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed a petition for review of a Commission order as untimely on the
ground that it was filed 63 days after the date of entry of the order, instead of within
the 60-day period allotted by statute. Newell contended that, for purposes of appellate jurisdiction, the date of entry of the order was the date on which notice of the
order is received. The court, however, agreed with the Commission that, under the
Commission's Rules of Practice, the date of "entry" of a Commission order is "the
date of the adoption of the order by the Commission, as reflected in the caption of
the order," and held that the rule is appropriate.
Constitutional Challenges To Commission Enforcement Authority-In
several recent cases, defendants in Commission enforcement actions have moved to
dismiss suits on the ground that the Commission, as an independent agency
whose members are not removable at will by the President, is barred by Article II of
the Constitution from bringing enforcement actions. These defendants argue that
law enforcement is an executive function that may only be exercised by an official
who serves at the pleasure of the President
In SEC v. Thomas, 157the court denied this constitutional challenge from the
bench. In SEC v. Warner, 158the court rejected the constitutional attack in a written
opinion relying heavily on a 1935 Supreme Court decision. 159And in The American Board of Trade, Inc. v. SEC, 160the court dismissed an action for declaratory
and injunctive relief without reaching the constitutional issue, holding that plaintiffs
could assert their claim as a defense in two pending Commission enforcement actions.
Another district court rejected a similar argument in SEC v. Blinder, Robinson
& CO.161 The defendants in that case subsequently raised the argument in two
pending appeals-one to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
from the district court's denial of a motion to vacate an injuntion in the Commission's enforcement action,162 and another to the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of a Commission order in an administrative proceeding. 163In both cases, the Commission argues that the President's
substantial authority over the Commission, including "for cause" removal power,
satisfies the constitutional requirement that the President "take care that the Laws
be faithfully executed." 164

61

Commission Participation in Private Litigation-The
Commission also participates as a friend of the court in selected private lawsuits that involve significant securities law issues. Such litigation is an important supplement to the Commission's enforcement program. In addition, because the federal securities laws
provide for private remedies as well as government enforcement actions, decisions
in private cases may have precedential effect on the Commission's own regulatory
activities.
In Shearson/American Express v. McMahon, 165 the Supreme Court ruled, in
accordance with arguments advanced by the Commission, that the Exchange Act
does not preclude enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements between
brokers and customers to resolve Rule lOb-5 claims. The Commission had urged
that a 1953 decision166 holding a pre-dispute arbitration agreement unenforceable was not applicable in light of the expanded authority given to the Commission
under the Exchange Act since 1975 to regulate arbitration procedures and ensure
that statutory rights are adequately protected.
The Commission has participated in several cases conceming the availability of
private remedies under the federal securities laws. Pinter v. DahL,167 pending before the Supreme Court, concems what relief is available, and who may be liable,
under Section 12(1) of the Securities Act, which provides a private remedy of rescission for violations of the Act's registration provisions. A purchaser of unregistered securities who had encouraged his co-plaintiffs to purchase brought this action to rescind the sales. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was "in 'pari
delicto," or at equal fault, with the defendant and could not, therefore, rescind his
purchases. The Commission takes the position that the issuer may raise an "in pari
delicto" defense where (1) the plaintiff primarily promotes, rather than invests in,
the securities offering, and (2) the plaintiff bears substantially equal responsibility
for the issuer's failure to register the securities or for the decision to conduct the offering in a manner that requires registration. The Commission also takes the position that only persons who either pass title or who solicit a purchase may be found
liable for the private remedy of rescission under Section 12(1). By contrast, Commission enforcement actions for violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act may be brought against a broader range of persons, including aiders
and abettors of the seller.
In the case of Ettinger v. Merrill Lynch, 168 a private litigant sued MerrillLynch
under Rule 10b-5 for selling zero-coupon bonds at alleged undisclosed excessive
mark-ups. In a brief filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the Commission urged reversal of the district court's determination that a
broker-dealer's compliance with routine confirmation disclosure requirements
precludes fraud liability for undisclosed excessive mark-ups. The Commission
also reiterated its long-standing position that undisclosed excessive mark-ups by
securities dealers violate the general antifraud provisions of the securities laws.
In another case conceming the liabilityof a brokerage firm, the Commission has
disagreed with a district court's determination that, when a firm employs a salesman as an "independent contractor," the firm cannot be liable for the actions of the
salesman when he steals its customers' money. In Hollinger v. Titan Capital
Corp., 169 pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
the Commission argues that, when a firm's salesman is not himself registered as a

62

broker-dealer, the salesman is an associated person of the firm, which has a duty
to supervise him.
In AZL Resources, Inc. v. Margaret Hall Foundation, Inc., 170 the Commission
filed a brief urging that certiorari be denied on the question whether Exchange Act
provisions that make a "controlling person" liable for acts of a company's employees or agents displace common law principles of vicarious liability. The Commission took the position that this question was not squarely presented in the case because the complaint alleged a claim that the company was directly liable for the
fraud at issue. The Supreme Court denied certiorari.
The Commission filed a friend of the court brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Brawer v. Options Clearing Corp. 171 This case
raised the question of whether there is an implied right of action, under Exchange
Act provisions relating to clearing agencies and stock exchanges, for violations of
the Options Clearing Corporation (Ocq by-law provision requiring adjustment of
options prices and terms in the event of certain recapitalizations. The Second Circuit agreed with the Commission's position that options investors and the options
markets generally are best served if the adjustment rule, which entrusts the decision to adjust the terms of an option contract to an OCC committee in its "sole discretion," is interpreted to be unreviewable except upon a showing of bad faith by
the decisionmakers.
The Commission recently filed briefs in two cases addressing the question
whether certain debt instruments issued by corporations not subject to federal
bank regulation are securities under the federal securities laws. In Holloway v.
Peat,Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 172 the district court held that debt instruments sold
to the public by a finance company, a trust company, and their parent holding
company met the statutory definition of "security." Nevertheless, relying on Marine Bank v. Weaver, 173 the court concluded that the trust company instruments
were not securities subject to regulation by the Commission. On appeal to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the Commission argues that
the exception identified by the Supreme Court in Marine Bank was based on the
applicability of a comprehensive federal bank regulatory scheme designed to ensure the solvency of the issuing bank and the safety of deposits. In Holloway, however,the issuers were not subject to federal bank regulation, or even to a comparable state bank regulatory scheme. Thus, the Commission urges that there is no
justification for ousting the protection of the federal securities laws.
Similarly, in Sanderson v. Roethenmund, 174 the Commission contends that
certain instruments called International Certificates of Deposit that are issued by a
corporation not subject to bank regulation are securities under the federal securities laws because: (1) they are "notes" within the definition of "security" in the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and (2) they are not subject to the Marine Bank
exception. Additionally, the Commission argues that, because these instruments
are within the statutory definition of security, they need not satisfy the test for "investment contract" under the law.175
The Commission successfully urged the United States Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit in Busch v. Cerpenter'l': to reverse the district court's finding that
certain securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act's intrastate offering exemption. The court agreed with the Commission that this exemp-

63

tion is only available for a distribution of securities (including resales by persons
purchasing without investment intent) within one state by an issuer "doing business" within that state. The court disagreed, however, with the Commission's position that the defendant must show that the original buyers bought with investment
intent Rather, it held that the defendant may make a prima facie case that the securities were distributed in-state by demonstrating that the stock was originally
sold only to residents of that state. The plaintiffthen has the burden of showing that
the distribution continued through resales by those persons.
Finally,the Supreme Court, in an opinion involving the impact of the Hague Evidence Convention on the use of traditional discovery procedures, agreed with the
position urged by the United States and the Commission that the Convention does
not provide the exclusive means for obtaining evidence abroad. In deciding S0ciete NationaLe IndustrieLLe AerospatiaLe v. United States District Court for the
Southem District of Iowa, 177 the Court also rejected the argument that, before lit-

igants may use ordinary discovery methods, they must resort to Convention procedures. Instead, the Court held that the particular facts of the case-including
sovereign interests and the likelihood that resort to the Convention's procedures
willprove effective-should determine whether the Convention procedures should
be used.
Trading On Material Non-Public Information-Cases
involving trading on
material nonpublic information continue to be litigated actively. This year the
Commission participated on appeal in three such cases.
In Carpenter v. United States, 178 the Commission and the United States argued
to the Supreme Court that it should sustain the criminal convictions for securities,
mail, and wire fraud of a newspaper reporter and two of his associates for trading
securities while in possession of market-sensitive information stolen from the reporter's employer. On the securities law issue, the Government argued that their
fraudulent scheme to purchase securities on the basis of nonpublic information
stolen in breach of the reporter's fiduciary duty to his employer violated the federal
securities laws. A primary purpose of the antifraud provisions is to preserve the integrity of the securities markets, and that integrity is threatened whenever persons
obtain an unfair advantage by trading on stolen nonpublic information. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the
mail and wire fraud convictions, and affirmed by an equally divided court the securities fraud convictions.
In SEC v. Certain Unknown Purchasers of the Common Stock and CaLLOptions of Santa Fe Intemational Corp., 179 an action based on illegal insider trading,
two objectors to a Commission settlement appealed to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit a decision by the district court to limit recovery
from the disgorgement fund to those who sustained net losses during the period
of illegal trading alleged in the Commission's complaint The court dismissed the
objection of one investor whose losses occurred before that period. With respect to
the other investor, who had traded during the time period but who had sustained
no net losses, the Court held that, in light of the limited size of the disgorgement
fund, it was reasonable for the district court to allow recovery only for investors who
suffered over-all losses.
Fmally, in another insider trading action, SEC v. Tome, 180 the United States
64

Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a judgment in favor of the Commission against defendants who traded on nonpublic information about a corporate takeover. The district court had enjoined the defendants--an Italian national,
an Italian broker-dealer, and three Panamanian corporations-from further antifraud violations and ordered disgorgement of more than $5.1 million in illegalprofits and interest The court of appeals rejected the argument of the Italian defendants that the district court never obtained jurisdiction over them because they were
never served personally with the complaint in the proceeding, but were served instead by notice published in a newspaper. Under the circumstances of this caseincluding efforts by the Italian defendants to deceive the Commission about their
involvement in the illegal trades and difficulties posed by foreign bank secrecy
laws-the publication notice was found by the court to be adequate and not in violation of constitutional due process guarantees. The court also dismissed argu-.
ments raised by all the defendants about the admissibility and sufficiency of the
evidence, and rejected a challenge to the lower court's disgorgement order. (The
court had earlier granted the Commission's motion to dismiss the appeal of another defendant in this case, who has refused to appear in response to an arrest
warrant issued in a related criminal case, on the ground that he is a fugitive from
justice.)

Tender Offer and Merger litigation-This
year, as in past years, the Commission filed friend of the court briefs in several cases involving tender offers and
mergers.
In CIS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp., 181 the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionalityof the Control Share Acquisitions Chapter of the Indiana Business Corporation
Law. The Commission and the United States had argued that the statute, which
strips certain securities purchasers of voting rights unless "disinterested" shareholders vote to restore them, is an unconstitutional restraint on interstate commerce. The Court rejected that argument, holding that the statute, to the limited extent it affects interstate commerce, is justified by the state's interests in defining the
attributes of shares in its corporations and in protecting shareholders. The Court
also found that the statute does not discriminate against interstate commerce in
securities since it does not distinguish interstate from intrastate acquisitions, and
does not create an impermissible risk of inconsistent regulation by different states.
In addition, the Court held that the Williams Act does not preempt the Indiana
statute.
In a pending case, Basic Incorporated v. Levinson, 182 the Commission filed a
briefin the Supreme Court concerning the standard for assessing the materiality of
merger negotiations under Rule lOb-5. The brief also addresses the issue of
whether the fraud-on-the-market theory can be used to show a plaintiffs reliance
on fraudulent corporate statements. The Commission argues that the proper standard for materiality is whether a reasonable investor would consider the information significant in making investment decisions. The significance to investors of an
uncertain event, such as a prospective merger, depends on balancing the importance of the merger to the company against the likelihood of its occurrence;
merger activity is material if the activity significantly increases the possibility of a
value-affecting merger. The Commission also argues that the fraud-on-themarket:theory is appropriate where there is an active secondary market, so that the

65

price of securities reflects corporate misstatements disseminated in the marketplace. A plaintiff who relies on a market price that reflects fraudulent statements
may be deemed to have indirectly relied on the fraudulent statements. Furthermore, the Commission argues, it is appropriate to presume that prices in active
secondary markets do reflect corporate statements and that investors do rely on
the integrity of the prices in those markets in making investment decisions.
At the request of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the
Commission filed a brief in Newmont Mining Corp. v. Pickens, et el., 183 arguing
that the federal securities laws do not require that a tender offeror have a firm financing commitment in place before commencing a tender offer. Rather, the
Commission argued, an offeror must fully and accurately disclose whatever financing arrangement has been made, and later amend its disclosure statement if
and when it acquires firm financing. This may require the offeror to extend the period of the tender in order to give shareholders an adequate opportunity to consider the new information. The court held, in a two-to-one decision, that the federal
securities laws do not require that a tender offeror have flxed financing before it
commences an offer.
The Commission filed a friend of the court brief in the Texas Supreme Court in
the case of Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil Co., 184 supporting review of an intermediate
state appellate court ruling that Pennzoil's contract to purchase stock did not violate Commission Rule 1Ob-13.The rule prohibits persons who have made a tender
offer for a security from purchasing, or making an arrangement to purchase, the
security other than through the tender offer. The Commission argued in its brief
that the alleged contract was an arrangement by Pennzoil to purchase stock outside of its outstanding tender offer for that stock, and thus violated the rule. The
Texas Supreme Court, finding no reversible error, refused to review the case.
Litigation Involving Requests for Access to Commission Records-Although
the Commission received more than 5,000 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
and confidential treatment requests in fiscal year 1987, only three of those requests
resulted in the filing of court actions against the Commission. Two cases were resolved favorably to the Commission, and the third, decided adversely to the Commission, is on appeal. The Commission received 1,908requests under the FOIAfor
access to Commission records and 3,205 requests for confidential treatment from
persons who submitted information. In fiscal year 1987, there were 69 appeals of
FOIA request denials to the Commission's General Counsel and four appeals of
confidential treatment request denials.
In one of the FOIA cases, Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. SEC, 185 the plaintiff
sought review of the Commission's partial denial of its request for confidential
treatment of documents obtained by the staff during its investigation of questionable foreign payments by Occidental. The district court remanded the matter to
the Commission for revision of its confidential treatment procedures and reconsideration of Occidental's request The Commission's appeal of the district court's
order is pending.
Litigation Against the Commission and Its Staff-During fiscal year 1987, the
Commission and its staff were defendants in 56 actions in which persons sought
to challenge Commission rules, to enjoin Commission law enforcement efforts, to

66

obtain awards for damages, or to challenge personnel decisions. The Commission
prevailed in all but one of the 15 cases decided during the fiscal year.
In Sprecher v. Fischer, 186 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a district court order dismissing Sprecher's second challenge of an ongoing Commission investigation. The district court concluded that resjudicata
and collateral estoppel barred his claims. In Panaro v. von Stein, 187 the plaintiff
has alleged that the same Commission investigation challenged in Sprecher v.
Fischer, 188 is unlawful. Panaro's motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice as
to two defendants, and without prejudice as to the others, is pending.
In Kendrick v. Zenides, 189 plaintiff brought a baseless retaliatory private damages action against the Commission staff members who participated in successful
civil and criminal prosecutions against him for various federal securities law violations. After dismissing the action, the court awarded the Commission attorney's
fees as a sanction against plaintiff's counsel for filing this frivolous case. Plaintiff's
counsel appealed the fee award to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, but subsequently withdrew the appeal.
Three actions were filed under the Right to Financial Privacy Act seeking to block
Commission subpoenas of bank records. In each of these cases, the district court
found that the Commission was seeking the records for a legitimate law enforcement inquiry and ordered compliance with the Commission's subpoenas.
In addition, two motions were filed in fiscal year 1987 under the Equal Access to
Justice Act seeking attorneys fees and expenses. The court awarded fees in the first
case. The Commission's appeal of that award is pending. In the second action, an
insider trading case, the court found that the Commission was substantially justified in bringing the suit and denied defendants' fee applications. The defendants'
appeal of that order is pending.
Finally, three court actions were filed against the Commission raising allegations
of illegal discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. One of these
actions is pending; the other two were decided favorably to the Commission.

Significant Legislative Developments
Insider Trading-On
December 11, 1986, former Chairman Shad testified before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce concerning the Commission's insider trading program.
The Chairman discussed some of the Commission's recent significant insider
trading cases, observing that these developments demonstrated the Commission's enhanced abilities to discover and prosecute inside traders.
During the lOOth Congress, the Senate held a series of hearings on legislation to
define insider trading. On June 19, 1987, Commissioner Cox testified before the
Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee, concerning a statutory definition of insider trading. He stated that the
Commission could support a statutory definition that preserved its enforcement
authority, but the Commission did not support S. 1380, a proposal before the Subcommittee, because certain provisions in the bill would impede enforcement efforts. At the request of the Subcommittee, the Commission prepared its own proposal for an insider trading definition, which was submitted to the Subcommittee
on August 3, 1987, and discussed by Commissioner Cox in testimony on August

67

7. Following the August 7 testimony, at the request of Senators Riegle and
D'Amato, the Commission participated in efforts to develop a consensus proposal
for legislation defining insider trading. As a result of this process, on November 18,
1987, the Commission submitted revised legislation defining insider trading.
Regulation of Corporate Takeovers-Both the House and Senate actively considered legislation conceming the regulation of corporate takeovers during the
first session of the 100th Congress. In April 1987, Commissioner Cox testified before the Subcommittee on Antitrust Monopolies and Business Rights of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. His testimony summarized the Commission's recent activity
in the tender offer area and discussed various proposals for amending the law governing takeovers.
On June 23, 1987, Commissioner Cox testified before the Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs concerning proposed corporate takeover legislation. Subsequently, on September 17, 1987, Chairman Ruder testified before
the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce concerning legislative proposals on takeovers. The
Commission's testimony generally supported legislation that would reduce the initial Schedule 13D filing period and, until a Schedule 13D is filed, prohibit further
acquisitions once the filing threshold is crossed. The Commission also favored
legislation to enhance its enforcement remedies for violations of the Section 13(d)
reporting requirements, including the authority to seek monetary penalties. The
Commission did not, however, support a number of other proposals that would
substantially alter the present scheme for regulating tender offers.
Proposed Bank Broker-Dealer Act-On May 4, 1987, the Commission sent to
Congress the proposed Bank Broker-Dealer Act, which would amend the Exchange Act to allow the Commission to regulate certain brokerage activities of
banks. This legislation is an outgrowth of Rule 3b-9, which was invalidated by the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in November
1986. The proposal would amend the Exchange Act's definition of "broker" and
"dealer" to include banks engaging in public solicitation of brokerage business,
banks receiving transaction-related compensation for brokerage services provided to trust, managing agency or other advised accounts, and banks dealing in
or underwriting securities. Additionally, the proposal would amend Section 15(a) of
the Exchange Act to require that banks establish separate entities, registered with
the Commission, to engage in securities activities, so that the Commission's regulation of those activities would not conflict with the regulation of banking activities
by other agencies. The Commission believes that this legislation is necessary to
protect the investors who do business with bank brokerage departments and to ensure that all entities engaged in the securities business are subject to a uniform regulatory scheme.
Proposed Truth in Savings Act-On August 5, 1987, General Counsel Daniel L.
Goelzer testified on behalf of the Commission before the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in
connection with the proposed Truth in Saving Act That legislation would require
uniform disclosure of interest rates payable on deposit accounts offered by depository institutions and of fees assessable against such accounts. The Subcommittee
asked the Commission whether the bill should be amended to include investment

68

companies. The General Counsel stated that such an amendment was unnecessary because the Commission has broad authority to regulate investment company advertising, and has exercised that authority to require widespread dissemination of investor information. In addition, in light of the functional differences
between deposit instruments and investment companies, there would be numerous practical problems if investment company activities were regulated under legislation designed for bank deposit accounts.
AgriculturaL Credit Act of 1987-0n
September 14, 1987, Congressman John
D. Dingell, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, requested Chairman Ruder's views on H.R. 3030, the proposed Agricultural Credit
Act of 1987, which would provide for the creation of securities backed by pooled
Farmers Home Administration loans. On October 1,1987, General Counsel Goelzer testified on this Act on behalf of the Commission at hearings held before the
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce. By letter dated October 15, 1987, the Commission objected to the proposed exemption of such securities from the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, arguing that the securities law exemption granted to the securities of other federally chartered corporations should not be considered a precedent in the case of these new securities, where the federal guarantee would be for
less than 100 percent of the value of such securities. The Commission also stated
that brokers and dealers in the farm loan securities market should be regulated under the broker-dealer provisions of the Exchange Act, rather than the Govemment
Securities Act of 1986, which regulates the activities of govemment securities dealers. Following the hearings, the proposed Agricultural Credit Act was amended to
incorporate the Commission's recommendations.
Commission Authorization Request-On May 13, 1987, former Chairman
Shad testified before the Subcommittee on Securities of Senate Banking, Housing,
and Urban Affairs Committee in support of the Commission's authorization request for fiscal years 1988-1990. Commissioner Cox testified on the same subject
before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce on June 4, 1987. The authorization requests include a set of conforming, clarifying, and other technical amendments to
the securities laws. In addition to correcting errors and deleting various obsolete
provisions, the legislation would give the Commission and the appropriate bank
regulators authority to sanction not only transfer agents but persons associated
with transfer agents as well. The grounds for sanctions would be expanded from violations of the transfer agent provisions of the Exchange Act to include convictions, injunctions, administrative orders, and misconduct of the type that are
grounds for sanctions against other securities professionals.
FinanciaL Guarantee Study-Section 105 of the Government Securities Act of
1986 directed the Commission to perform a study concerning "the use of the exemption contained in (S)ection 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.c.
77c(a)(2» for securities guaranteed by banks, and the use of insurance policies to
guarantee securities." On August 31, 1987, the Commission transmitted its report,
which concluded that the Section 3(a)(2) exemption places insurance companies
at an apparent competitive disadvantage, since a corporate security backed by a
bank standby letter of credit is exempt from the Securities Act's registration re-

69

quirements, but a corporate security backed by an insurance policy is not The
Commission, however, was unable to quantify the extent of disadvantage. To address any disparity, the Commission recommended that Congress amend Section
3(a)(2) of the Securities Act to eliminate the exemption from registration for securities issued or guaranteed by banks. At the same time, the Commission recommended that Congress amend the Securities Act to provide authority for the Commission to grant exemptive relief from the registration provisions of the Act for
those securities or securities transactions for which full registration is unnecessary.
Report on the InternationaLization of the Securities Markets-In July 1987,
the Commission's staff submitted its Report on the Internationalization of the Securities Markets to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. This comprehensive
report examined a wide range of issues raised by the accelerating internationalization of the securities markets, including: (1) United States and foreign disclosure
and distribution requirements and their application to international issues of securities; (2) differing accounting and auditing standards in relation to multinational issues of securities; (3) the globalization of securities markets and its effects on
broker-dealers, investment companies and investment advisers; (4) the enforcement of the United States securities laws in a global securities market; and (5) economic trends affecting internationalization. In preparing the report, the Commission staff conducted extensive research in the fields of law, economics and
accountancy. The staff anticipates that the report will be used by Congress and the
Commission to examine possible legislative, rulemaking, or policy initiatives to
deal with internationalization of the securities markets.
Federal Government Loan Sales-On
February 19, 1987. former Chairman
Shad testified before the Senate Committee on the Budget about the applicability
of the federal securities laws to the sale of federal government loan assets. On
March 10, 1987, Commissioner Fleischman testified before the House Committee
on Small Business on the same subject. Sales of such federal assets are mandated
by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 in order to reach the GrammRudman-Hollings fiscal year 1987 deficit target of no more than $144 billion. The
Commission reviewed the applicability of the Securities Act to the proposed sales,
possible statutory exemptions that might be utilized, and the requirements imposed by registration under the Securities Act. The Commission also examined
how the government loan sales would be affected by other securities statutes, particularly the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Corporate Reorganizations
The Commission acts in a statutory advisor's role in reorganization cases under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to ensure that the interests of public investors
are adequately protected. In these cases a debtor generally is allowed to continue
business operations under court protection while it negotiates a plan to rehabilitate
the business and to pay the company's debts. Reorganization plans often provide
for the issuance of new securities to creditors and shareholders in exchange for
part or all of their claims or interests in the debtor, under an exemption in the Bankruptcy Code from registration under the Securities Act.

70

In its capacity as special advisor, the Commission may raise or present its views
on any issue in a Chapter 11 case. Although the Commission may not initiate an
appeal, it frequently participates in appeals taken by others. While Chapter 11 relief
is available to businesses of all sizes,the Commission generally limits its participation to cases involving debtors that have publicly traded securities registered under
the Exchange Act. In fiscal year 1987, the Commission presented its views on a variety of issues.
Committees-Official committees are empowered to negotiate with a debtor in
possession on the administration of a case and to participate in all aspects of the
case, including formulation of a reorganization plan. With court approval, an official committee is permitted to employ, as a cost of administration, one or more attorneys, accountants, or other agents to assist the committee in performing its
duties. In addition to a committee representing creditors holding unsecured
claims, the Code allows the court or a United States Trustee to appoint additional
committees for stockholders and others where necessary to assure adequate representation of their interests. During fiscal year 1987, the Commission moved or
supported motions for the appointment of committees to represent investors in
three Chapter 11 cases. 190
In In re Johns-Manville Corp., 191 the Official Equity Holders Committee, appointed at the outset of the case to represent both common and preferred interests,
moved to have itself disbanded because of irreconcilable conflicts over the
debtor's proposed plan, and sought the appointment of separate committees to
represent the two interests. The bankruptcy court disbanded the official committee
but refused to appoint separate replacement committees. In so doing, the court relied principally on the presence of individual common and preferred shareholders
who were active in the case. In addition, the court expressed its belief that shareholders would not suffer a "critical degree" of prejudice if new committees were not
appointed. The Commission supported an appeal by both classes of shareholders
to the district court, urging that the bankruptcy court had applied improper legal
criteria in refusing to appoint the substitute committees. The district court, however, found no abuse of discretion in the bankruptcy court's refusal to appoint the
committee. The court also concluded that, since Manville had already filed a plan
of reorganization substantially diluting common stockholder interest, there was no
longer a need for an official committee to represent shareholders.
The Commission supported a further appeal by certain Manville common
stockholders to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from this
refusal to appoint a committee. In connection with this appeal, the Commission
joined the stockholders in seeking to stay the hearing on confirmation of Manville's
plan pending resolution of this key issue. The Commission urged that, contrary to
the reasoning of the lower courts, a committee was needed to represent common
stockholders at the critical stage of plan confirmation. The court denied the stay
and thereafter dismissed the appeal without reaching the merits, holding that it
lacked jurisdiction over the committee controversy since the order refusing to appoint an official committee was not a final, appealable order. The court concluded
that such orders were reviewable only on appeal from the final order of plan confirmation or upon certification of an interlocutory order from the district court
In In re The LTV Corporation, 192 the Commission, as a result of its experience
71

in Manville, filed a motion for the appointment of separate equity security holders
committees to represent common and preferred stockholders. The Commission
argued that, because the appointment of separate committees is economically
feasible in a large case such as this (involving some $6.3 billion in assets), it is preferable to appoint such committees at the outset rather than waiting until an actual
conflict develops. Appointing a single committee to represent both interests is appropriate only in smaller cases where it is economically infeasible for the estate to
bear the cost of two committees for the duration of the case. The bankruptcy court
disagreed with the Commission and appointed a single committee to represent
both common and preferred shareholders.
Consistent with its reasoning in LTV, the Commission moved in In re Towle
Manufacturing CO.193 for the appointment of a single equity security holders
committee to represent both common and preferred stockholders. The Commission concluded that, in light of the debtor's relatively small size and number of
shareholders, two committees were impracticable. After initiallydenying the Commission's motion for a committee, the bankruptcy court, upon rehearing, ordered
the appointment of a single stockholder committee.
The Commission responded on another important issue related to committees,
in In re Psych Systems, Inc., 194 to objections filed by creditors concerning the
proper standard to be applied in awarding attorney fees for an official equity securityholders' committee when the estate proves to be insolvent and shareholders do
not ultimately participate in the plan of reorganization. The Commission urged that
the provision in Section 330(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which authorizes payment
for the "actual and necessary" professional services of a committee, permits compensation for attorney's services reasonably related to the perforrnance of duties
within the scope of the committee's official responsibilities, without regard to
whether those services produce a measurable benefit to the estate or to the committee's constituents. The Commission pointed out that the proper remedy is to
disband a committee when it becomes apparent that the committee is unnecessary, rather than altering the standard of compensation for committee counsel at
the end of a case. The bankrutpcy court, agreeing with the Commission, authorized payment to committee counsel.
Estate Administration-The
Commission acts to protect the interests of public
investors in reorganization cases by participating on selected issues involving administration of the debtor's estate that have a significant impact upon the rights of
public investors.
In In re Amarex, Inc., 195 the Commission supported an appeal to the district
court by limited partner investors, urging reversal of the bankruptcy court's decision to subordinate all their claims pursuantto Section 51O(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code, which provides for the automatic subordination of rescission or damage
claims arising out of the purchase or sale of securities. The Commission argued
that Section 51O(b) should not be read to subordinate every claim by a security
owner against a debtor. The Commission pointed out that it is not uncommon for
security owners to have distinct and legitimate claims other than securities fraud
type claims and that Section 51O(b) was not intended to affect those claims. The
district court agreed with the position urged by the Commission, noting that the
statute's language and the legislative history reveal that Congress intended subor72

I
j

dination to apply to claims related to the purchase or sale of a security--and to no
other claims. An appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
is pending.
The case of In re Standard Metals 196 raised the issue of whether a debtor that
has taken no steps to give notice of the time for filing claims to potential creditors
not listed on its schedules may cut offthe right of such creditors who filelate claims
to participate in the reorganization. The bankruptcy court concluded that, because
the claim involved in the case, which was based on the debtor's violations of the
federal securities laws, was presumably unknown to the debtor before the claims
bar date was established, notice of the bar date was not required, The district court
affirmed. The Commission argued in an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, that the Bankruptcy Code and rules impose a duty on
the debtor to give at least publication notice to unscheduled creditors. In addition"
the Commission argued that due process requires an appropriate form of notice
before claims may be barred and discharged in a reorganization case. In its initial
opinion, a panel of the court affirmed the lower courts' orders without reaching the
question of notice. 197 A dissenting judge urged that due process required notice,
and that the debtor and the bankruptcy court had a duty to give notice once the existence of creditors claiming fraud became known.
Thereafter, the court granted a petition for rehearing on the issue of notice. On
rehearing, the Commission reiterated its view that the Bankruptcy Code and rules
as well as due process require publication notice to unscheduled creditors.
The Commission also argued that, where creditors subsequently become
known, the statute places a duty on the debtor and on the bankruptcy court to see
that appropriate notice is directed to those creditors. The appeal on rehearing is
pending.
The Commission has taken the position, both in Standard Metals and in In re
American Reserve, 198 a Chapter 7 case in which the Commission is appearing as
a friend of the court, that a creditor may file a class proof of claim in bankruptcy on
behalf of other similarly situated creditors. In its briefs, the Commission has argued
that neither the Bankruptcy Code nor the Bankruptcy Rules should be read to preclude the fIlingof class proofs of claims. In the Commission's view,the broadened
claim concept adopted in the Bankruptcy Code, and the prospect that many individuals in a bankruptcy may have similar claims, are inconsistent with a restrictive
interpretation of the proof of claim requirement The Tenth Circuit in its initialopinion in Standard Metals disagreed with the Commission on this issue and ruled
against class claims in bankruptcy. Likewise,a district court ruled in American Reserve against the filing of class proofs of claim. An appeal to the Seventh Circuit is
pending in American Reserve, where the Commission has reiterated its longstanding position. An appeal is also pending on this issue in the district court in In
re Charter Co., 199 where the Commission has taken the same position.
Disclosure Statements/Plans of Reorganization-A
disclosure statement is a
combination proxy and offering statement used in soliciting acceptances of a plan
of reorganization. Such plans often provide for the exchange of new securities for
claims and interests of creditors and shareholders of the debtor. The Bankruptcy
Code provides that adequate disclosure is to be made without regard to whether or
not the information provided would otherwise comply with the disclosure require73

ments of the federal securities laws. But, in recognition of the Commission's special expertise on disclosure questions, the Bankruptcy Code recognizes the Commission's right to be heard, distinct from its special advisory role, on the adequacy
of disclosure. For this reason, the Bankruptcy Rules require service on the Commission of all disclosure statements.
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission received approximately 5,288 disclosure statements filed in Chapter 11 cases involving both privately-held and
publicly-held corporations. The staff limits its review to those disclosure statements filed in cases involving a publicly-held company or a company likely to be
publicly traded as a consequence of the reorganization. During 1987, the staff reviewed 143 disclosure statements.
In its reviewof disclosure statements, the staff seeks to determine whether the issuance of securities under a plan is consistent with the exemption from registration
in the Bankruptcy Code and otherwise in compliance with the federal securities
laws. The Commission also reviews statements to determine whether there is adequate disclosure concerning the proposed plan. Generally, the Commission seeks
to resolve questions concerning bankruptcy disclosure through staff comments to
the plan proponent If questions cannot be resolved through this process, the
Commission may object to the disclosure statement in the bankruptcy court.
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission commented on disclosure statements
in 108 cases, and objected to a disclosure statement in one case. In In re Custom
Laboratories, Inc.,200 the Commission filed objections to the debtor's disclosure
statement, arguing that it contained inadequate information concerning management, the feasibility of the reorganization plan, and the basis for relying upon the
bankruptcy exemption from Securities Act registration for the sale of securities to
existing shareholders. The Commission also urged the court to order amendment
of the plan to eliminate provisions that purported to release non-debtor individual
liability.Following the filing of the Commission's objections, the debtor withdrew
its disclosure statement
In addition to specific disclosure concerns, the Commission acts to assure that
public investors are given an opportunity to be heard on disclosure-related questions. From time to time, the Commission objects to confirmation of plans where
there is a significant legal question presented. During fiscal year 1987, the Commission objected to confirmation in two cases and filed a brief on issues raised in
an appeal from plan confirmation in a third case.
The Commission filed objections to confirmation of reorganization plans that
provided for the discharge of third party liabilityfor securities lawviolations in In re
Energy Exchange Corporation and Vulcan Energy Corporation,201 and In re
Storage Technology Corporation. 202 The Commission argued that, unless there
is separate consideration in exchange for the discharge, a plan cannot condition
the receipt of distributions under a plan on release of claims against third parties.
The Commission argued that such a discharge contravenes Section 524 of the
Bankruptcy Code, which provides that the discharge of a debtor does not affect the
liabilityof any other entity with respect to the debt The Commission further argued
that insofar as a plan purports to release persons from liabilityunder the federal securities laws, it is contrary to public policy. In both cases, the bankruptcy courts
74

1

overruled the objections, holding that the release provisions of the plan were not
improper discharges under the Code.
In In re Johns-ManvilLe,203 the Commission filed a brief in an appeal by common stockholders of the bankruptcy court's order confirming a plan of reorganization. In its brief, the Commission reiterated its position that common stockholders
in that case were improperly denied representation at the confirmation hearing because of the bankruptcy court's refusal to appoint an official committee. The Commission, however, recognized that the error in refusing to appoint a committee did
not necessarily require reversal and a new hearing. The Commission urged that the
appropriate standard of review in light of the error was whether there was a reasonable possibility that the shareholders, if represented by a committee, could have
presented evidence disputing the debtor's evidence of insolvency. The district
court subsequently affirmed the bankruptcy court's order confirming the plan of
reorganization .

Economic Research and Analysis
Key 1987 Results
The economic and statistical research program provides the Commission and
the Divisions with the perspective and the technical support required to understand
and evaluate the economic aspects of Commission regulation. This program is
carried out by the Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis (DEPA) and the Office of the Chief Economist (OCE).
The economic staff provides the Commission with economic advice and research studies on rule proposals, established policy and the capital markets. The
staff assists the Commission in making decisions affecting the efficiency and
structure of our nation's securities industry and markets. In addition, the program
encompasses statistical monitoring of major program initiatives impacting the securities industry, domestic and international capital markets, and publication of the
Commission's SEC Monthly Statistical Review.
Changes in the marketplace have increased the number and complexity of economic issues before the Commission. The trend toward increased internationalization of the securities markets, the recent turbulence in financial markets, the application of new technology within the industry, and the continued expansion of new
financial products have greatly complicated the analysis of the impact of Commission regulation. New and more complex market structures and trading systems
also increase the need for economic analysis. For example, the operation of options markets has significantly changed due to the introduction of new automated
execution systems and as a result of different exchanges trading options on the
same NASDAQ securities.
The world's securities markets have become more interdependent in response
to economic, institutional, technological and regulatory forces. At the same time,
the securities markets have assumed a larger role in the international capital market as international bond issues grew from $38 billion in 1980 to $225 billion in
1986. Regulatory changes are now occurring in the capital markets of, among
others, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and France. There has also been a
rapid maturation of foreign securities markets which have experienced faster
growth rates compared to the United States market
United States and Canadian securities markets have developed electronic trading links, and the London Stock Exchange now participates in the first transatlantic
link with United States markets, exchanging quotation information in selected
stocks. The National Association of Securities Dealers is also planning to begin the
exchange of quotations with the Stock Exchange of Singapore. Additionally, the
American Stock Exchange has entered into an agreement with the European Options Exchange which allows investors to open an options position in one market
and close it in the other. United States clearing agencies have begun to develop
links with clearing agencies from around the world.
During fiscal 1987, the economic staff reviewed 110 rules and rule proposals.
76

Rule reviews emphasized the economic costs and benefits of alternative approaches to regulation. In addition, advice was given to the operating divisions on
requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), particularly focused on reducing regulatory burdens on small business entities. In fiscal 1987, the economic staff
reviewed 65 RFA analyses and certifications.
Also during the fiscal year, the staff prepared a report to Congress, in conjunction with other divisions and offices, on the internationalization of securities markets. Specifically, the economics staff analyzed: (1) the extent and nature of international trading in securities; (2) United States and foreign portfolio investment
patterns; (3) the growth of the international bond and equity market; (4) major restructuring in overseas markets; and (5) the emergence of various international
funds as vehicles to facilitate international capital flows. The staff published a
major study on the effects of multiple trading in options based upon recent experience with options on OTC equities as well as on the traditional listed equities. The
staff also prepared a report analyzing the use of repurchase agreements by brokerdealers and the risks which are involved in such transactions. This study was used
as a framework for considering several amendments to the broker-dealer financial
responsibility and recordkeeping rules. The staff also developed a system to detect
and analyze possible instances of market manipulation involving the use of options.
In the full disclosure area, the staff prepared an empirical analysis of the trading
and returns behavior of initial public offerings to assist the Commission in determining the appropriate time period needed for prospectus delivery. The staff also
updated an earlier analysis of Schedule 130 filings to aid in determining the need
for revisions in beneficial ownership reporting. Studies completed in the corporate
control area covered such topics as sources of tender offer financings, dual class
recapitalizations, effects of defeating takeover attempts, market anticipation of
takeovers and the effects of the Ohio takeover law. Additionally, the economics
staff assisted the Division of Corporation Finance in examining alternative criteria
for establishing the threshold parameters for including corporations in the mandatory disclosure system. The staff prepared a study assessing the effects of Rule 415
(shelf registration) on the revenues of securities underwriters. Another study analyzed the effects of an accounting ruling which upheld a book value ceiling test for
oil and gas companies using full-cost accounting.
The economics staff examined fund disclosure regarding the costs of buying,
holding and redeeming mutual fund shares to determine if it is meaningful and accessible enough to assist investors in making informed decisions. Other analyses
examined the use of fund assets in the distribution of mutual fund shares and the
results of this practice for investors, investment companies and the fund distribution system. The staff also examined problems that have developed in mutual fund
advertising practices in portraying fund performance and evaluated the impact of
potential regulatory solutions on the effectiveness of fund advertising and the ability of investors to make informed decisions.

Management and Program Support
Key 1987 Results
The goals of program direction are to formulate and execute the Commission's
policies and to efficiently manage the agency's resources in support of those policies. Those goals are accomplished primarily in two ways-policy management
and administrative support. Policy management activities involve formulation, review and assessment, information dissemination, and executive resource management. Administrative support encompasses services such as accounting, data
processing, staffing and logistics to support the Commission's work.
Policy Management
The Commission continued hosting roundtable discussions and other forums
with industry and investor representatives on a variety of issues relating to the securities markets. The Commission held 120 meetings to consider approximately
570 rule proposals, enforcement actions, and other matters that significantly affect
the health of the securities markets and the nation's economy. In addition, Commission officials testified in 19 Congressional hearings on topics such as tender offer regulation, insider trading, program trading, and the internationalization of the
securities markets.
The Commission's management staff initiated 24 major projects during the fiscal year including reviews of the information security program and internal control
objectives. In addition, numerous internal audits were conducted of Commission
programs, activities and functions.
Consumer Affairs and Information

Services

Consumer affairs specialists responded to approximately 40,000 complaints
and inquiries during fiscal year 1987, representing an 11 percent increase over last
year. Of these, approximately 46 percent involved investor disputes with registered
broker-dealers, 23 percent related to general inquiries, and 18 percent concemed
issuers of securities. The remaining complaints and inquiries related to mutual
funds, transfer agents, banks, or investment advisers. The majority of complaint
letters were processed internally. However, 29 percent of the letters were referred
on behalf of the investor to investment firms for review and resolution. In addition,
the Office of Consumer Affairs and Information Services developed materials to
apprise investors of the current status of companies involved in class action litigation and bankruptcy proceedings, and also began revising its consumer education
materials.
The office processed 1,908 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and
3,205 confidential treatment requests during the fiscal year, representing increases
of 24 and 64 percent, respectively, over fiscal year 1986. Confidential treatment requests were typically made in connection with proprietary corporate information
and were carefully evaluated. The staff also coordinated 2,005 Congressional re-

78

quests for Commission records, representing a 50 percent increase over last fiscal
year.The Commission's FOIA regulations were amended to comply with the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent policy guidance from the
Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Justice.
More than 21,000 visitors used the Commission's Public Reference Room in
Washington, D.C. The public can view most corporate filings, broker-dealer and investment advisor registrations, Commission releases, and other public materials at
this facility. Approximately 358,800 documents were recorded on microfiche and
made available to the public during the fiscal year. The Commission also maintains Public Reference Rooms in the New York and Chicago regional offices.

Equal Employment

Opportunity

The Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) staff conducted a onehour seminar on the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace for all Commission employees. The EEO staff also instructed 165 managers and supervisors
from headquarters and two regional offices on issues dealing with EEO law, affirmative action, complaint processing, and other EEO matters.
During fiscal year 1987, the employment of women increased 2.7 percent. Employment for all other minority groups remained constant. The Commission's
work force consists of 32 percent minorities and 49 percent women. As in past
years, the contributions and achievements of minority groups and women were
recognized with programs for Afro-American History Month, Asian-Pacific American Heritage Week, Hispanic Heritage Week, and Women's Week.
The Commission-Securities Industry Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity continued its financial support of minority students by awarding $17,000
in scholarships during the fiscal year. Scholarship funds were contributed by brokerage firms, exchanges, securities associations, broker-dealers, and investment
advisers that are members of the Committee.

Facilities Management
The Office of Administrative Services (OAS) assisted in relocating the Boston regional office and the San Francisco branch office and began negotiating with the
General Services Administration (GSA) on the forced relocation of the New York
regional office. OAS also acquired additional space in the Commission's headquarters building to support expanded enforcement operations and the EDGAR
project, requiring extensive alterations to accommodate new staff. In addition, GSA
delegated contract authority to the Commission over the existing guard contract
for the headquarters building. As a result, the Commission saved $70,000 because
GSA no longer received reimbursement for administering the contract.

Financial Management
Commission funding in fiscal year 1987 was initially provided by an annual appropriation of $110.5 million. This amount was later increased by $4 million to
cover the full costs of the January 1987 pay increase and the new Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). The Commission spent $112 million of its
total appropriation. The remaining $2.5 million, consisting of unspent funds for the

79

EDGAR project and FERS, was returned to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).

The Commission continued to improve its financial management programs.
The use of microcomputers was expanded to expedite the preparation of financial
reports required by the Office of Management and Budget and other executive
oversight agencies. The fee collection process was enhanced through a greater
use of electronic funds transfer and Treasury-sponsored lockbox facilities. Also,
audits were conducted to ensure that distributed payroll, accounting and budget
functions were performed in strict compliance with established regulations. The
Commission reduced the amount of travel advances by increasing staff use of
Diners Club cards and by receiving travel vouchers promptly from staff.As a result,
an additional $70,000 was available for travel by program staff during the fiscal
year. Finally,the Commission payroll system completed its third year as a host system available to other Government agencies.
During fiscal year 1987, Commissioners participated in 61 meetings and conferences. To pay the cost of attendance, private entities reimbursed the Commission
$27,073 while the government's portion amounted to $8,201. Commission staff
participated in 376 meetings and conferences. The Commission was reimbursed
$109,319, while the government's portion of these costs totaled $30,865.
Information Systems

Management

The Office of Information Systems Management (ISM)made significant progress in integrating and improving automation functions at the Commission. Specifically,ISMsuccessfully awarded a contract to acquire 80 portable, laptop microcomputers for regional office examiners and investigators. ISMalso acquired an
additional 128 desktop microcomputers for use by headquarters staff. Microcomputers already have demonstrated their effectiveness for applications such as word
processing and spreadsheet operations. In addition, ISMhas initiated analyses and
studies for an integrated office automation system at the Commission.
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission acquired and installed the Bridge Market Information system, which provides real-time price and volume information, as
well as consolidated quotes and news items on stocks and options traded on the
exchanges and over-the-counter. The system also provides historical trade information, including data on commodities and financial futures. This system has had
a substantial impact on meeting the information requirements of the Commission
staff in certain program areas because stock and futures trading can be monitored
more effectively.The staff can also perform on-line comparisons between financial
futures and their underlying indices and compute an annualized rate of return available through the execution of an arbitrage program.
ISMsuccessfully awarded a contract to replace one of the Commission's obsolete mainframe central processing units. A request for proposals was released to
procure a replacement for the remaining central processing unit with an award
projected for early 1988. The new units willpermit the Commission to upgrade its
capability to respond to increasing information reporting and analysis requirements.

80

Personnel Management
During fiscal year 1987, employees currently enrolled in the Civil Service Retirement System were permitted to change to the new Federal Employees Retirement
System (FERS) and to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. The Commission successfully implemented FERS on schedule in January 1987. This effort required extensive coordination among the Offices of Personnel, the Comptroller, and Information Systems Management. The Office of Personnel provided counseling and
disseminated information to help employees decide whether to switch to FERS.
The Commission assisted employees further by providing decision advisors and a
software package designed to analyze projected benefits under the two retirement
systems.
•
The Office of Personnel improved its recruitment productivity through newly
delegated hiring authority for research assistants, examiners, accountants, and
secretaries. The office also obtained delegated authority to hire attorneys above
minimum pay rates and to offer special pay rates to headquarters typists. In addition, the staff participated in two job fairs which were extremely beneficial in generating applications, interviews, and new employees in a variety of occupations.
The training program emphasized computer literacy skills by enrolling 223 employees in 301 microcomputer applications courses. Other improvements to the
training program involved revising headquarters supervisory training to provide for
more participation by top Commission executives as guest speakers and conducting special training on stress management and leadership.
The Office of Personnel took steps to improve the efficiency of its position management program. For example, three standardized position descriptions were established for use throughout the Commission. The office implemented new standards issued by the Office of Personnel Management for paralegal specialists. The
Commission also initiated a program to study and evaluate occupations across organizationallines. In addition, several reorganizations were implemented and the
accuracy of position descriptions were certified in half of the Commission's divisions and offices.
In November 1986, the Commission received the Outstanding Employer of the
Year Award from the District of Columbia Rehabilitation Services Administration.
This award recognized the Commission's efforts in hiring and training handicapped individuals and enhancing supervisors' understanding of the handicapped.

Public Affairs
The Office of Public Affairs communicates information on Commission activities to those interested in or affected by Commission actions, including regulated
entities, the press, employees of the Commission and the general public. Both ongoing activities and special projects are undertaken by the office in support of the
Commission's mission.
Public Affairs staff prepares the SEC News Digest, which provides information
on vitually all SEC actions-rule changes, enforcement actions against individuals
or corporate entities, acquisition reports, releases, decisions on requests for exemptions, upcoming Commission meetings, and other events of interest.Inforrna81

tion on Commission activity is also disseminated through notices of administrative
actions, litigation releases, and other materials. The News Digest is available in the
Public Reference Room.
Press releases issued prior to Commission meetings and press briefings conducted after these meetings provide insight into proposed and adopted changes in
policies and regulation. The office also issues press releases on upcoming events,
on-going programs, and special projects. In all, 89 news releases were issued during the year. When appropriate, actions are brought to the attention of the national
and regional press. Special projects such as roundtable discussions on emerging
issues in the financial markets are also publicized.
The office directs publication of the SEC Annual Report that provides information on C~mmission activities to Congress, the securities bar and other interested
parties, and, through the Depositary Library System, to selected colleges and universities throughout the country.
Speeches presented by Commissioners and senior staff and testimony are retained and disseminated in response to requests from the public. During the year,
the staff responded to approximately 69,500 requests for information and coordinated programs for 93 groups of foreign visitors. Also during the year, the staff updated and revised such publications as the "SEC Publications Guide", "Investigate
Before You Invest", and "Q & A for Small Business".
Public Affairs publishes a regular newsletter, the Employee News, and prepares
a daily summary of news clips for Commission employees.

Commission Operations
For the fifth consecutive year and the sixth time in the Commission's 53-year
history, revenues collected exceeded the agency's annual appropriation. In fiscal
year 1987, the Commission collected $278.4 million for deposit into the general
fund of the United States Treasury. These revenues amount to 243 percent of the
Commission's 1987 appropriated funds. Total collections consisted of $263.9 million in fee revenue and $14.5 million in disgorgements from fraud actions. Fee revenue is generated from four primary sources: (1) securities registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 (61 % of the total); (2) transactions on securities exchanges
(24%); (3) tender offer and merger filings (12%); and (4) miscellaneous filings
(3%).

Securities Industry Dollar In 1986
For Carrying and Clearing Firms
Data for carrying and dearing firms only
are presented here to allow for more detail,
as reporting requirements for firms which
neither carry nor dear differ and data aggregatIon of these two types of firms necessarily results in loss of detail. Carrying and
dearing firms are those firms which clear
securities transactions or maintain possession or control of customers' cash or securities. This group produced 86 percent of
the securities industry's total revenues in
calendar year 1986.
Brokerage activity accounted for about
31 cents of each revenue dollar in 1986, exactly the same as in 1985. Securities comrnissions were the most important component, producing 20 cents of each dollar of
revenue, while margin interest and revenues from mutual fund sales generated 5
cents and 6 cents, respectively.
The dealer side produced 60 cents of
each dollar of revenue. Twenty-nine of
these cents came from trading and investment, 11 cents from underwriting, and 20
cents from other securities-related revenues. The latter is comprised primarily of
interest income from securities purchased
under agreements to resell and fees from
handling private placements, mergers and
acquisitions.
Total expenses consumed 89 cents of
each revenue dollar earned in 1986, almost
the same as the 1985 level of 88 cents. This
resulted in a pre-tax profit margin of 11
cents per revenue dollar.
Employee-related expenses (registered

representatives' compensation and clerical
and administrative employees' expenses)
are the largest component of expenses.
Employee-related expenses summed to
$19.9 billion, and consumed 36 cents of
the revenue dollar in 1986, a slight increase
from 1985. In dollar terms, interest expense
increased to $14.2 billion, $2.7 billion more
than the year before. As a percent of revenues, however, interest expense declined
slightly in 1986 to absorb 25 cents of each
revenue dollar. Other expense categories
consumed about the same proportion of
the Industry revenue dollar In 1986 as they
did in 1985.
Total assets of broker-dealers carrying
and clearing customer accounts rose by
$71.8 billion to $509.7 billion In 1986.
About 63 percent of this increase can be attributed to resale agreements, which rose to
$188.4 billion. By year-end 1986, resale
agreements had become the single most
important item on the balance sheet of
these firms, compnsing 37 percent of assets. Firms' proprietary positIons of $167.0
billion had a modest increase of 7.5 percent
and accounted for 33 percent of assets.
Most of the remaining assets represented
receivables either from customers or other
broker-dealers.
Total liabilities, including subordinated
debt, increased $66.1 billion or 16 percent
to $483.0 billion. About 87 percent of this
growth was due to the $56.0 billion increase in repurchase agreements. Owners'
equity rose 27 percent from $21.0 billion in
1985 to $26.7 billion, and total capital increased 36 percent to $36.7 billion from
$27.0 billion in 1985.

Self-Regulatory Organizations:
Expenses. Pre-Tax Income and
Balance Sheet Structure
In 1986 the total revenues of selfregulatory organizations ("SROs") with
marketplace jurisdiction
rose approximately $133.1 million to $778.2 million, an
increase of 21% over 1985 (the 1985 increase was 15% over 1984). The New York
Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") and
American Stock Exchange ("Amex") accounted for 67% of these SROs' total revenues. Most of the SRO revenues came from
listing, trading, and market data fees. The
NYSE reported total revenues of $296.3
million, of which 58% consisted of listing
and trading fees. The Amex reported total
revenues of $102.2 million, and NASD reported $124.5 million. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange ("CBOE") had the largest percentage increase (31 % ) in revenues
for the second consecutive year.
The total expenses of all marketplace
SROs were $647.5 million in 1986, an increase of $83 million (15%) over 1985. The
Midwest Stock Exchange ("MSE") had the
largest percentage increase in total expenses, 22%. The Spokane Stock Exchange's ("SSE") total expenses remained
unchanged in 1986, with expenses totaling
$57,000.
Aggregate pre-tax income of these SROs
rose to $125.3 million in 1986 from $73.8
million in 1985, an increase of 70%. Pre-tax
profit margins widened because aggregated total revenues increased 21 % and
aggregate total expenses increased only
15%. These wider margins can be partly attributed to rising trading volume and a corresponding increase in transaction fees.
The NYSE had a pretax income of $48.6
million, a 36% increase from 1985. The
CBOE had an increase of $9.2 million,
from $9.2 million to 18.4 million. Amex had
an increase of $10.1 million or 105%, the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange ("Phlx") an
increase of $2.3 million or 115%, and the
Boston Stock Exchange ("BSE") an increase of $799 thousand or 116%. The Pa-

cific Stock Exchange ("PSE") had a 1981
pre-tax income of $1.2 million, an increase
of 12% over 1985 pre-tax income. Finally
the CSE had a pre-tax income of $113thou
sand, a significant reversal of its 1985 performance in which the CSE had a pre-tax
loss of $37 thousand. In addition, 1986 was
the first year in five in which the CSE reported a net pre-tax gain rather than a pretax loss.
The total assets of all marketplace SROs
were $1,556 million in 1986, an increase of
31% from 1985. The NYSE'stotal assets increased by $27.8 million or 9%, from 1985
to 1986. The total assets of the MSE and the
Phlx also increased significantly but these
increases were due largely to increased asset levels at certain subsidiaries.
The aggregate net worth of the SROs
roseto $474.7 million in 1986 from $400.9
million in 1985, an increase of 18%. The
largest percentage increase was at the CSE
(160%), followed by the Spokane Stock
Exchange (40% ), the BSE (30% ), and the
NASD (27%). The NYSE's net worth increased by 14% from $162.7 million to
$184.8 million.
Aggregate clearing agency service revenue increased by 24%, or $54 million, in
1986 due to increases in securities trading
volume and additional use of depository
services. Total deposisitory service revenue
increased $36 million primarily due to a
$29 million gain by the Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") and a $5 million gain by
the Midwest Securities Trust Company
("MSTC"). Service revenue of clearing corporations increased by $18 million, which
was largely attributable to increases of
almost $4 million at the Options Clearing
Corporation ("OCC") and $12 million at the
National Securities Clearing Corporation
("NSCC").
The depositories continued to expand
the base for service revenues by increasing
the number of shares on deposit and the
face value of debt securities in custody. At
the end of 1986, the total value of securities
in the depository system reached $2.8 trillion, of which DTC alone held over $1.4 trillion not including some $1.1 trillion in cer-

115

tificates held by transfer agents as DTC's
agent. This movement of certificates into
depositories was due to further expansion
of the lists of depository eligible issues and
the desire of participants to avail themselves of depository services. The MSTC
had 541,000 eligible issues at year end, up
59%, and DTC had 372,000, up 42%. The
major portion of the growth was in debt issues, particularly municipal bonds, which
increased 38% to approximately $450 billion of face value. This represents 58% of
the value of all municipal bonds outstanding in the United States.
Total depository pre-tax income was
down $2.7 million, 47% from the previous
year's result. In 1986, DTC made $2 million
less than last year when they had increased
shareholders' equity to mitigate business
uncertainties. DTC, like all clearing agencies, adjusts refunds of fees and fee structures to earn funds to meet expenses and
provide the amount of earnings which it
wishes to retain.
The clearing corporations recorded an
aggregate increase in pre-tax income of
almost $3.8 million. NSCC posted pre-tax
earnings of $6.5 million, up $32 million
over 1985. The acc recorded a significant
decrease in pre-tax income of almost $12
million; most of this change was due to last
year's one-time increase of over $1 million
which was used to capitalize a new subsidiary, the Intermarket Clearing Corporation
("ICC). acc, through management of
fees, reported a slight loss for the options
operations while reporting a profit at ICC
equal to ICC's loss of its initial year, 1985.
The Pacific Clearing Corporation
("PeC") incurred a pre-tax loss of over

116

$300,000 after reporting a loss of $12 million in 1985. The Pacific Securities Depository Trust Company ("PSDTC) reported a
pre-tax loss of $292,000 in 1986 versus a
pre-tax operating gain of $189,000 the previous year. In 1986, PSE, the parent company, transferred revenues from equities
trading to PCC and PSDTC in the amounts
of $787,000 and $322,000, respectively,
thus increasing service revenues. Further
PSE support to its subsidiaries was provided by forgiving allocated administrative
and financial services furnished by the parent to PeC and PSDTC in the amounts of
$654,000 and $2.1 million respectively.
The combined net worth of PCC and
PSDTC further declined to $124,000 from
$433,000 at the end of 1985. Subsequently,
in April 1987, the Board of Directors of the
PSE authorized the closure of those clearing and depository functions not essential
to the operation of the PSE. The one-time
cost of closure was projected to be between
$5 and $7 million.
The aggregate net worth of all clearing
corporations and depositories rose by $6
million to a new high of almost $39 million.
In addition to the increase in net worth, participant clearing fund contributions which
provide protection to the clearing agencies
in the event of a participant default also increased. Should a participant default and
its losses exceed its deposit, the entire participants' fund may be charged on a pro rata
basis. However, no clearing agency has
ever assessed non-failing participants' contributions. The equity clearing (participants') funds increased by 30% to $360
million. Depository clearing (participants')
funds increased slightly to $223 million.

EXEMPTIONS
Section 12(h) Exemptions
Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to grant a complete or partial exemption from the registration provisions of Section 12(g) or from
other disclosure and insider trading provisions of the Act where such exemption is
consistent with the public interest and the
protection of investors.
For the year beginning October I, 1986,
nine applications were pending and an additional six applications were filed during
the year. All fifteen of these applications
were granted. No applications were pending at the close of the year.

Exemptions For Foreign
Private Issuers
Rule 12g3-2 provides various exemptions from the registration provisions of
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act for the
securities of foreign private issuers. Perhaps the most important of these is that
contained in subparagraph (b) which provides an exemption for certain foreign issu-

120

ers which submit, on a current basis, the
material specified in the rule. Such material
includes that information about which investors ought reasonably to be informed
and which the issuer: (I) has made public
pursuant to the law of the country of domicile or in which it is incorproated or organized; (2) has filed with a foreign stock exchange on which its securities are traded
and which was made public by such exchange; and or (3) has distributed to its security holders. Periodically, the Commission publishes a list of those foreign issuers
which appear to be current under the
exemptive provision. The most current list
is as of April 30, 1988, and contains a total
of 1,684 foreign issuers.

ANANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
There were 3,074 companies registered
under the Investment Company Act of
1940 as of September 30, 1987. New registrations totaled 422 with 44 registrations
terminated during the fiscal year. This compares with 1986 fiscal year figures of 2,583
total registrations, 299 new registrations
and 47 terminations.

Certificate Immobilization
Book-entry deliveries continued to outpace physical deliveries in the settlement of
securities transactions among depository
participants. This tendency is illustrated in
Table 24,IMMOBIUZAllON lRENDS. The
Table captures the relative significance of
the mediums employed, in a ratio of bookentry deliveries to certificates withdrawn
from DTC. The figures exclude municipal
bearer bonds. In 1987, while the number of
shares traded in U.S. markets increased by
32%, the total certificates withdrawn from
DTCincreased less than 10%, and the ratio
of book-entry deliveries to certificates with-

drawn continued to grow. In 1987, the ratio
was over two and a half times the 1982 figure of 3.0 book-entry deliveries rendered
for every certificate withdrawn.

Trading Suspensions
During fiscal year 1987, the Commission
suspended trading in the securities of
twelve companies. This compares with five
in fiscal year 1986. In most instances, the
trading suspension was ordered because of
substantial questions as to the adequacy,

accuracy or availability of public information concerning the company's financial
condition or business operations, or because transactions in the company's securities suggested possible manipulation or
other violations.

Foreign Restricted Llst
The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign
Restricted List which is designed to put
broker-dealers, fmancial institutions, investors and others on notice of possible unlawful distributions of foreign securities in the
United States. The list consists of names of
foreign companies whose securities the
Commission has reason to believe have
been, or are being offered for public sale in
the United States in possible violation of the
registration requirement of Section 5 of the
Securities Act of 1933. The offer and sale of
unregistered securities deprives investors
of all the protections afforded by the Securities Act of 1933, including the right to receive a prospectus containing the information required by the Act for the purpose of
enabling the investor to determine whether
the investment is suitable for him. While
most broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions in securities issued by companies
on the Foreign Restricted List, this does not
necessarily prevent promotors from illegally offering such securities directly to
investors in the United States by mail, by
telephone, and sometimes by personal
solicitation. The following foreign corporations and other foreign entities comprise
the Foreign Restricted List,
1. Aguacate Consolidated Mines, Incorporated (Costa Rica)
2. Alan MacTavish, Ltd. (England)

Right to F'mancial Privacy
Section 21 (h) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 [15 U.S.c. 78u(h)(6)1 requires
that the Commission "compile an annual
tabulation of the occasions on which the
Commission used each separate subparagraph or clause of [Section 21(h)(21)] or
the provisions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 [12 U.S.c. 3401-22 (the
RFPA)1to obtain access to financial records
of a customer and include it in its annual report to the Congress."
During the fiscal year, the Commission
made no applications to courts for orders
pursuant to the subparagraphs and clauses
of Section 21(h)(2) to obtain access to fi-

154

nancial records of a customer. The table
below sets forth the number of occasions
upon which the Commission obtained accesss to the financial records of a customer
using the procedures provided by (i) Section 1105 of the RFPA (12 U.S.c. 3405 I, applicable to administrative subpoenas; (ii)
Section 1104 of the RFPA (12 U.S.c. 3404],
applicable to customer consents; and (iii)
