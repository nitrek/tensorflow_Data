ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on March 30, 2015. The OIP alleges that Respondents violated the
antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 in their operation of three collateral
loan obligation funds (known as the Zohar Funds) by reporting misleading values for the assets
held by the funds and failing to disclose a conflict of interest arising from Lynn Tilton’s
undisclosed approach to categorization of assets. The proceeding was stayed by order of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit between September 17, 2015, and June 2016. See
Tilton v. SEC, No. 15-2103, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 9970, at *37 (2d Cir. June 1, 2016); Tilton v.
SEC, No. 15-2103, ECF Nos. 76, 125. The hearing is currently scheduled to commence on
October 24, 2016.
Under consideration are Respondents’ August 22, 2016, “Motion for Limited
Modification of May 7, 2015 Order”; the Division of Enforcement’s August 29, 2016,
opposition; and Respondents’ September 1, 2016, reply. The motion relates to the May 7, 2015,
order that set the procedural schedule with the consent of the parties. Lynn Tilton, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 2647, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1773 (A.L.J. May 7, 2015). The order scheduled
the hearing to begin on October 13, 2015; set the prehearing procedural schedule; and specified
that the expert witnesses’ direct testimony will be via expert report. Id. The order further
provided that, at the hearing, the experts will present a brief summary of their testimony and be
made available for cross examination. Id. The schedule included the following dates for expert
reports:
July 10, 2015
August 10, 2015
August 31, 2015

Division’s Expert Reports
Respondents’ Expert Reports, including Rebuttal Reports
Division’s Rebuttal Expert Reports

Id. The parties exchanged their expert reports and rebuttal expert reports in compliance with that
schedule.
Respondents now wish to substitute or add new experts. Specifically, Respondents
previously submitted the expert report of Marti P. Murray in response to the report of Division
expert Ira Wagner and the expert report of J. Richard Dietrich in response to the report of
Division expert Steven L. Henning. Respondents state that Murray will be, and Dietrich may be,
unavailable to testify during the dates when hearing sessions are expected to be held.
Respondents propose to substitute Peter Vinella and Steven L. Schwarcz for Murray. Depending
on Dietrich’s actual availability, Respondents propose to substitute, and/or add, Charles
Lundelius, Jr. Respondents have not submitted new expert reports but suggest September 26,
2016, as the due date for such reports. The Division opposes Respondents’ request, essentially
on the ground that expert reports and rebuttal reports were exchanged long ago in compliance
with the parties’ agreed-on prehearing schedule and that allowing such new developments
shortly before the hearing commences would significantly prejudice the Division. It notes that –
under the agreed-on schedule – the Respondents’ expert reports, including rebuttal reports, were
due two months before the scheduled start of the hearing and that the Division’s rebuttal reports
were due three weeks after Respondents’ reports. Further, the Division notes that, based on
Respondents’ representations, while Murray and Dietrich have busy schedules, their schedules
do not render them totally unavailable to testify. In reply, Respondents suggested the September
26, 2016, date for their new reports, two weeks earlier than the October 10 date they originally
proposed.
Insofar as Respondents propose to introduce new expert reports, their motion will be
denied. It is noted that Respondents previously expressed concerns about the schedules of
hearing participants, and the undersigned ruled that they could arrange for their expert witnesses
to appear by video teleconference, if necessary. Lynn Tilton, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No.
4004, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2499 (A.L.J. July 20, 2016). Further, such video conference sessions
could be held within a reasonable time after the live hearing sessions, if necessary. Finally, since
the Division has not raised any objection to the expertise of Vinella, Schwarcz, or Lundelius,
Respondents may consider having one or more of them adopt the opinions of the existing expert
report[s] as his own and being examined by the Division on those opinions.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
