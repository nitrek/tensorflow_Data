REOPENING OF COMMENT PERIODS FOR CERTAIN RULEMAKING RELEASES
AND POLICY STATEMENT APPLICABLE TO SECURITY-BASED SWAPS
PROPOSED PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND THE
DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT
AGENCY:

Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION:

Reopening of comment periods.

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is reopening the
comment periods for its outstanding rulemaking releases, published in the Federal Register and
listed herein, that concern security-based swaps (“SB swaps”) and SB swap market participants
and were proposed pursuant to certain provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), among other provisions (together, the “Proposed Rules”). The
Commission is also reopening the comment period for its Statement of General Policy on the
Sequencing of the Compliance Dates for Final Rules Applicable to Security-Based Swaps
adopted pursuant to the Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, published in the Federal Register
on June 14, 2012 (the “Policy Statement”). The reopening of these comment periods is intended
to allow interested persons additional time to analyze and comment upon the Proposed Rules and
the Policy Statement in light of the Commission’s proposal of substantially all of the rules
required to be adopted by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, its proposal of rules and
interpretations addressing the application of the SB swap provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-

Frank Act to cross-border SB swap transactions and non-U.S. persons that act in capacities
regulated under the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Cross-Border Proposed Rules”), and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s (the “CFTC”) adoption of substantially all of the rulemakings
establishing the new regulatory framework for swaps. All comments received to date on the
Proposed Rules and the Policy Statement will be considered and need not be resubmitted.
DATES:

For the Proposed Rules and the Policy Statement, the comment periods are re-

opened until July 22, 2013.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I.

Background
Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd Frank Act 1 (“Title VII”) amends the Securities Act of

1933 (“Securities Act”) 2 and the Exchange Act 3 to substantially expand the regulation of the SB
swap market with a goal of establishing a new regulatory framework within which this market
can evolve in a more transparent, efficient, fair, accessible, and competitive manner. 4 Under the
Dodd-Frank Act, regulatory authority over derivatives is divided between the Commission and
the CFTC, with the Commission having authority over SB swaps, the CFTC having authority
over swaps, which represent the overwhelming majority of the overall market for derivatives
subject to the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Commission and the CFTC jointly regulating mixed
swaps. 5

The Title VII amendments to the Exchange Act generally require, among other things: (1)
the registration and comprehensive oversight of security-based swap dealers and major securitybased swap participants; 6 (2) the reporting of SB swaps to a registered security-based swap data
repository (“SDR”), or to the Commission (if the SB swap is uncleared and no SDR will accept
the SB swap), and dissemination of SB swap information to the public; 7 (3) the clearing of SB
swaps at a registered clearing agency (or a clearing agency that is exempt from registration) if
the Commission makes a determination that such SB swaps are required to be cleared, unless an
exception from the mandatory clearing requirement applies; 8 and (4) if an SB swap is subject to
the clearing requirement, the execution of the SB swap transaction on an exchange, on a
security-based swap execution facility (“SB SEF”) registered under the Exchange Act, 9 or on an

swap,” among others. These terms are defined in sections 721 and 761 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Commission
and the CFTC have adopted further definitions of these terms in a joint rulemaking. See Further Definition of
“Swap,” “Security-Based Swap,” and “Security-Based Swap Agreement”; Security-Based Swap Agreement

Most recently, the Commission has proposed the Cross-Border Proposed Rules, which
address the treatment of cross-border SB swap transactions and non-U.S. persons acting in
capacities regulated under Title VII. 17 While the Commission may propose additional rules
pertaining to SB swaps that are not mandated by Title VII, SB swap market participants and
other members of the public now have a substantially complete picture of the Commission’s
proposed regulatory framework for SB swaps. Additionally, the CFTC has adopted nearly all of
the rules establishing the swaps regulatory regime. 18
II.

Reopening of Comment Periods
In light of the substantially complete picture of the proposed SB swap regulatory regime and

the CFTC’s adoption of many of the rulemakings creating the swaps regulatory regime, the
Commission is reopening the comment period of the Proposed Rules and the Policy Statement
until [insert date 60 days from publication in the Federal Register] to provide the public with
an additional opportunity to analyze and comment upon the proposed SB swap regulatory
framework, either in part or as a whole. Commenters may submit, and the Commission will
consider, comments on any aspect of the Proposed Rules and the Policy Statement. In addition
to the questions raised in the Proposed Rules and the Policy Statement, the Commission
specifically seeks comments on the following:

the Policy Statement;

•

Whether there are any areas where additional rules or interpretations should be proposed or
formal guidance provided and if so, why.
