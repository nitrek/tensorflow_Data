In the Matter of

ORDER DIRECTING PARTIES TO HOLD
A PREHEARING CONFERENCE

MED-X, INC.
On October 13, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order directing
hearing in this matter. The next day, Respondents’ counsel submitted a letter requesting a
hearing as soon as feasible. A hearing is currently scheduled for November 14, 2016, at
Commission headquarters in Washington, D.C.
I ORDER as follows:
1)
Each party must file with the Commission, and keep current, a notice of
appearance in accordance with Rule of Practice 102, 17 C.F.R. § 201.102.
2)
By October 21, 2016, the parties shall hold an initial prehearing conference
without the hearing officer to discuss each numbered item in Rule of Practice 221(c), 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.221(c).1 By October 24, 2016, the parties shall file a joint prehearing conference statement
reflecting the results of their conference. That statement must:

1

(a)

address each numbered item in Rule of Practice 221(c), and include
proposed due dates where applicable (the parties may denote that an item
is “not applicable” in their filing);

(b)

propose a procedural schedule that will result in a hearing no later than
sixty days from the date of this order; and

(c)

address the date(s), potential location, and length of any hearing.

The Rules of Practice are available online at https://www.sec.gov/about/rules-of-practice2016.pdf. General instructions for Respondents, including the mailing address for filings, are
available online at http://www.sec.gov/alj/alj-instructions-for-respondents.pdf.

If the parties wish for the hearing to take place on November 14, 2016, as originally
scheduled, they should advise my office as soon as possible, and I will strive to accommodate
that schedule. Based on the prehearing statement, a subsequent prehearing conference with the
hearing officer will be scheduled if appropriate. If the parties are unable to hold a prehearing
conference within the time provided, the Division shall promptly notify my office.
The parties should email courtesy copies of any filings in this proceeding in PDF textsearchable format and, when possible, in Word format, to alj@sec.gov.
