ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-DESIST
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION
21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER

In the Matter of
SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against
SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“SciClone” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
These proceedings arise out of violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and
internal accounting controls provisions of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”) [15
U.S.C. § 78dd] by SciClone concerning its pharmaceutical operations in China.
2.
From at least 2007 to 2012, employees of SciClone subsidiaries, who acted as agents
of SciClone in conducting business in China, gave money, gifts and other things of value to foreign
officials, including healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) who were employed by state-owned hospitals
in China, in order to obtain sales of SciClone pharmaceutical products. Various means were
employed, and these schemes were known to and condoned by various managers within
SciClone’s China-based corporate structure. The related transactions were falsely recorded in
SciClone’s books and records as legitimate business expenses, such as sponsorships, travel and
entertainment, conferences, honoraria, and promotion expenses. During this period, SciClone also
failed to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls and lacked an
effective anti-corruption compliance program.
Respondent
3.
SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“SciClone”) is a pharmaceutical company
organized under the laws of Delaware, with headquarters in Foster City, California. SciClone
issued and maintains a class of publicly traded securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are traded on the NASDAQ. SciClone’s products are
primarily marketed and sold in China.
Other Relevant Entities
4.
SciClone Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. (“SPIL”) is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of SciClone that is incorporated in the Cayman Islands with an affiliate in Hong Kong.
SciClone operates internationally primarily through subsidiaries, including SPIL and SPIL’s
wholly-owned subsidiaries that sell and promote SciClone’s products in China. SciClone directs
the relevant operations of SPIL and its subsidiaries and oversees SPIL’s operations through various
means including through the appointment of directors and officers of SPIL, review and approval of
its annual budget, business and financial goals, and oversight of its legal, audit, and compliance
functions. SciClone also reviews and approves annual marketing and promotion budgets of SPIL
and its subsidiaries. During relevant periods, some SciClone officers also served as officers and/or
directors of SPIL, traveled frequently to China to participate in the management of SPIL, and were
1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
2

responsible for negotiating its contracts with its Chinese distributors. SPIL’s books and records are
consolidated by SciClone and reported in its financial statements.
Facts
5.
Although SciClone has local distributor relationships in China, its sales and
marketing activities there are conducted through SPIL. Sales representatives in China regularly
reported to senior management of SPIL on their efforts to increase sales. In these reports, sales
representatives openly referred to instances in which they provided weekend trips, vacations,
gifts, expensive meals, foreign language classes, and entertainment to HCPs in order to obtain an
increase in prescriptions from those HCPs. As described by one sales manager, this was “luring
them with the promise of profit.”
6.
Some sales representatives referred to those HCPs with the greatest impact on
their sales volume as VIP clients, and provided details on their volume of prescriptions when
reporting to SPIL. This practice was known and encouraged by certain former SPIL managers at
the time SPIL and SciClone had overlapping officers and/or directors. These reports included
such things as:


In August 2005, numerous surgical VIP clients including several hospital presidents
attended the annual Qingdao Beer Festival consisting of golf in the morning and
beer-drinking in the evening. In later years, SPIL continued to sponsor VIPs to the
annual festival.



In February 2007, VIP clients were provided with vacations to Anji, China.



In November 2007, a sales representative recounted the experience of recruiting a
VIP client by paying for family vacations and regular family dinners through an
employee expense account. The sales representative attributed a nearly four-fold
sales increase to that VIP as a result.

7.
In 2007, SciClone submitted a license application to the State Food and Drug
Administration for a new medical device product and had a renewal pending for its largest product.
SciClone hired a well-connected regulatory affairs specialist (“Specialist”) to facilitate that
licensing.
8.
The Specialist arranged trips for two foreign officials to attend an academic
conference in Greece at SciClone’s expense. The conference was solely related to the new medical
device. One of the foreign officials had oversight over new product approvals, and the other
foreign official had oversight over renewals for existing licensed products. At the time the trip was
arranged, both SciClone’s renewal application and its application for a new license were pending.
9.
As the foreign officials were unable to obtain travel visas in time to attend the
conference in Greece, the Specialist instead provided them at least $8,600 in lavish gifts. The
3

Specialist submitted two expense reimbursements for the gifts, the first of which was approved by
the senior vice president of SPIL.
10.
After learning of the gifts, SciClone terminated the Specialist and conducted an
internal investigation related to the Specialist’s conduct and practices in China. The review did not
look more broadly at sales and marketing practices in China. No further action or remedial
measures were taken by SciClone or SPIL after the conclusion of the internal investigation in 2008.
11.
Local Chinese travel companies were routinely hired to provide services (such as
arranging transportation, accommodations, and meals for HCPs) in connection with what were
ostensibly legitimate conferences, seminars, and other events. In addition to a lack of due
diligence for these third party vendors, prior to 2012, there was a lack of controls over the events
to ensure they had an appropriate business purpose and that the events actually occurred. Many
events did not include a legitimate educational purpose or the educational activities were
minimal in comparison to the sightseeing or recreational activities. For example:


Between at least 2008 and 2010, SciClone sponsored dozens of Chinese HCPs to
attend liver and oncology conferences in the United States. While a portion of the
travel was devoted to educational purposes, it also consisted of significant
sightseeing that involved, for example, travel to Las Vegas and Los Angeles with
tours of the Grand Canyon or Disneyland.



In April 2010, SPIL sponsored Chinese HCPs to attend a seminar in Japan
regarding Zadaxin, its principle product. While a portion of the meeting appeared
to involve half a day of educational activities, the remaining six days involved
sightseeing and tourist locations such as Mt. Fuji.



In March 2010, SPIL held its annual sales meeting in China on the island of
Hainan, a resort destination. The sales meeting was attended by the sales
representatives and senior management from SPIL. The weekend before the sales
meeting, SPIL hosted VIP clients to a weekend stay on Hainan. There was no
educational component to the VIP clients’ stay.

12.
As part of its remedial efforts, SciClone conducted a detailed, comprehensive
internal review of promotion expenses of employees from 2011 to early 2013. This review
found high exception rates indicating violations of corporate policy that ranged from fake fapiao,
inconsistent amounts or dates with fapiao, excessive gift or meal amounts, unverified events,
doctored honoraria agreements, and duplicative meetings. A portion of the funds generated
through the reimbursements were used as part of the sales practices described above that
continued through at least 2012.

Legal Standards and Violations
13.
Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a ceaseand-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any
provision of the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or
should have known would contribute to such violation.
FCPA Violations
14.
Under Section 30A(g) of the Exchange Act it shall also be unlawful for any issuer
organized under the laws of the United States, or a State, territory, possession, or commonwealth
of the United States or a political subdivision thereof and which has a class of securities registered
pursuant to section 78l of this title or which is required to file reports under section 78o(d)) of this
title, or for any United States person that is an officer, director, employee, or agent of such issuer
or a stockholder thereof acting on behalf of such issuer, to corruptly do any act outside the United
States in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any
money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any of
the persons or entities set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (a) of this section
for the purposes set forth therein, irrespective of whether such issuer or such officer, director,
employee, agent, or stockholder makes use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce in furtherance of such offer, gift, payment, promise, or authorization. [15
U.S.C. § 78dd-1].
15.
Under Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer. [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A)].
16.
Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and (II) to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B)].
17.
As described above, SciClone through SPIL violated Section 30A(g) by providing
things of value to foreign officials, including healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) who were
employed by state-owned hospitals in China, in order to obtain sales of SciClone pharmaceutical
products. SciClone violated 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by improperly recording the
payments to health care providers as sales, marketing, and promotion expenses. The false entries
were initially recorded by SPIL which were then consolidated and reported by SciClone in its
consolidated financial statements. SciClone violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) by failing to devise and
5

maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls to detect and prevent the making of
improper payments to foreign officials.
SciClone’s Remedial Efforts
18.
SciClone has taken steps to improve its internal accounting controls and to create
a dedicated compliance function. These include the following: (1) hiring a compliance officer
for its China operations; (2) undertaking an extensive review of the policies and procedures
surrounding employee travel and entertainment reimbursements; (3) substantially reducing the
number of suppliers providing third-party travel and event planning services; (4) improving its
policies and procedures around third-party due diligence and payments; (5) incorporating anticorruption provisions in its third-party contracts; (6) providing anti-corruption training to its
third-party travel and event planning vendors; (7) disciplining employees (and their managers)
who violate SciClone’s policies; and (8) creating an internal audit department and compliance
department.
Undertakings
19.

Respondent has undertaken to:
1. Report to the Commission staff periodically, at no less than nine-month
intervals during a three-year term, the status of its remediation and
implementation of compliance measures. During this three-year period,
should Respondent discover credible evidence, not already reported to
the Commission staff, that questionable or corrupt payments or
questionable or corrupt transfers of value may have been offered,
promised, paid, or authorized by Respondent, or any entity or person
acting on behalf of Respondent, or that related false books and records
have been maintained, Respondent shall promptly report such conduct to
the Commission staff. During this three-year period, Respondent shall:
(1) conduct an initial review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct
and prepare at least three follow-up reviews and reports, as described
below:
a. Respondent shall submit to the Commission staff a written report
within 180 calendar days of the entry of this Order setting forth a
complete description of its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(“FCPA”) and anti-corruption related remediation efforts to date,
its proposals reasonably designed to improve the policies and
procedures of Respondent for ensuring compliance with the FCPA
and other applicable anticorruption laws, and the parameters of the
subsequent reviews (the “Initial Report”). The Initial Report shall
be transmitted to Charles Cain, Deputy Unit Chief, FCPA Unit,
Division of Enforcement, United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F St NE, Washington, DC 20549. Respondent
6

may extend the time period for issuance of the Initial Report with
prior written approval of the Commission staff.
b. Respondent shall undertake at least three follow-up reviews,
incorporating any comments provided by the Commission staff on
the previous report, to further monitor and assess whether the
policies and procedures of Respondent are reasonably designed to
detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable
anti-corruption laws (the “Follow-up Reports”).
c. The first Follow-up Report shall be completed by no later than 270
days after the Initial Report. The second Follow-up Report shall
be completed by no later than 540 days after the completion of the
Initial Report. The third Follow-up Report shall be completed by
no later than 810 days after the completion of the Initial Report.
Respondent may extend the time period for issuance of the Followup Reports with prior written approval of the Commission staff.
d. The periodic reviews and reports submitted by Respondent will
likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive
business information. Public disclosure of the reports could
discourage cooperation, impede pending or potential government
investigations and thus undermine the objectives of the reporting
requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain nonpublic, except (a) pursuant to court order, (b) as agreed by the
parties in writing, (c) to the extent that the Commission staff
determines in its sole discretion that disclosure would be in
furtherance of the Commission’s discharge of its duties and
responsibilities, or (d) is otherwise required by law.
2. Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertaking(s) set forth above.
The certification shall identify the undertaking(s), provide written
evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be supported by
exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The Commission staff
may make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and
Respondent agrees to provide such evidence. The certification and
supporting material shall be submitted to Charles Cain, with a copy to
the Office of Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division, no later than
sixty (60) days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent SciClone’s Offer.
