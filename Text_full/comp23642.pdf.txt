v.

CHARLES A. BANKS,IV
Jury Trial Demanded
Defendant.

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
alleges as follows:
NATURE OF ACTION
1.

This matter involves securities fraud committed by Charles Augustus

Banks,IV ("Banks"), an Atlanta-based investment adviser, against one of his
clients ("the Investor"), a former professional basketball player.
2.

Between May 2012 and October 2012, Banks made material

misrepresentations to, and omitted material facts from, the Investor to induce the
Investor to invest $7.5 million in Gameday Entertainment, LLC ("Gameday"), a
private retailer of sports team apparel and merchandise.

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 2 of 30

3.

Specifically, Banks represented to the Investor that Gameday intended

to offer two investors the opportunity to invest in a $15 million mezzanine debt
and equity offering of the company, for which each investor would receive 12%
interest (paid monthly), equity in Gameday, and a security interest in all of
Gameday's assets. Banks also represented to the Investor that Gameday would use
approximately $5 million of the $15 million raised for Gameday's ongoing
operations and business development, and the remaining amount would be used to
pay off certain of its existing bank debt so that the Investor would have a first lien
position on Gameday's assets.
4.

Based on these representations, the Investor invested $7.5 million in

Gameday. The Investor instructed Banks to transfer that amount to Gameday from
a line of credit that Banks controlled for the Investor. However, at the time Banks
transferred the money to Gameday, Banks knew that his representations to the
Investor were misleading and false.
5.

In particular, Banks knew that no other investor had invested in the

offering, and thus Gameday's existing bank debt would not be retired so that the
Investor could obtain a first lien position on Gameday's assets. Moreover, Banks
did not disclose to the Investor that he had prearranged to receive from Gameday a
$225,000 fee for securing the Investor's investment or that he intended to
misappropriate a portion of the Investor's monthly return.
2

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 3 of 30

6.

Within a few days of Gameday receiving the Investor's money, Banks

instructed Gameday to pay him the $225,000 fee and divert to him 20% of the
Investor's monthly return, or $15,000 of the $75,000 that Gameday owed the
Investor monthly. Banks received these monthly payments for approximately two
years. Banks also instructed Gameday to begin paying him over $600,000 in
various past due amounts that Gameday allegedly owed him.
7.

In June 2013, while continuing to act as the Investor's investment

adviser, Banks defrauded the Investor again by deceiving him into signing a
personal guarantee and subordination agreement on an approximately $6 million
bank line of credit to Gameday. To obtain the Investor's signature, Banks directed
that only the signature page of the guarantee document be sent to the Investor,
while falsely representing to the Investor that it would reduce his existing
investment risk in Gameday.
8.

In fact, the guarantee substantially increased the Investor's risk in the

Gameday investment. To further enrich himself, Banks also instructed Gameday
to divert to him a 3% "guarantee fee," or at least $180,000, that was due to the
Investor as consideration for providing the guarantee.
9.

By engaging in the conduct alleged in this Complaint, Banks violated

Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act")[15 U.S.C. § 77a(a)];
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934("Exchange Act") and Rule

DEFENDANT
16.

Charles Augustus Banks,IV, age 48, is a resident of Atlanta,

Georgia. In 2012 and 2013, Banks owned (with a business partner) approximately
42% of the outstanding shares in Gameday. Banks also portrayed himself publicly
as the Chairman of Gameday's Board of Directors.
17.

Banks's position as Chairman of Gameday, his ownership interest in

the company, and his past sourcing of Gameday's capital and financing gave
Banks influence over Gameday's CEO,Jeffrey J. Neal("Neal")

5

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 6 of 30

18.

Banks is also the founder, a principal, and the majority owner of

Terroir Capital, LLC ("Terroir"), an exempt reporting adviser that manages at least
two private funds created by Banks. Those funds are Terroir Hotel &Resort Fund
II, L.P., and the Terroir Winery Fund, L.P.(collectively, the "Terroir Funds"). The
Terroir Funds own wineries and resort properties.
19.

Prior to forming Terroir, Banks was president and part owner of CSI

Capital Management, LLC ("CSI"), an investment adviser registered with the
Commission. In Apri12011, SunTrust Investment Services, Inc.("SunTrust"), an
SEC-registered investment adviser, purchased CSI.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.

Banks Becomes The Investor's Investment Adviser

20.

Banks joined CSI in 1992.

21.

In 1997, Banks was an Executive Vice President at CSI. In that

position, Banks successfully solicited the Investor to become an advisory client of
CSI.
22.

Banks was the Investor's primary point of contact with CSI.

23.

In 1999, Banks received an ownership interest in CSI.

24.

In 2001, Banks became the President of CSI.

25.

Over time, Banks's role with the Investor expanded to include

advising the Investor on various business matters. Banks advised the Investor, for

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 7 of 30

example, about investing in a fund called the Terroir Hotel and Resort Fund, L.P.
Banks subsequently advised the Investor on other private investments, including
investments in the Terroir Funds.
26.

In 2007, Banks left his management role at CSI and formed Terroir.

Banks continued, however, to have an ownership interest in CSI.
27.

Terroir became the adviser, directly or through affiliates, to the

Terroir Funds.
28.

Although Banks was no longer in a management role at CSI, he

remained CSI's primary point of contact with the Investor. Banks also continued
to facilitate CSI's communication with the Investor about the Investor's advisory
account with CSI.
29.

In addition, Banks continued to have access to the Investor's account

information at CSI and could view the Investor's investment holdings.
30.

In 2011, CSI sold its business, including the Investor's advisory

account, to SunTrust. Although Banks was not employed by SunTrust after the
acquisition, he maintained a relationship of trust and confidence with the Investor.
Banks also remained involved with the Investor's advisory account by
communicating with SunTrust on the Investor's behalf regarding the investments
the Investor held at SunTrust.
31.

Banks also negotiated an exception from acovenant-not-to-compete

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 8 of 30

with SunTrust that allowed Banks, with certain limitations, to continue advising
legacy CSI clients, including the Investor, about potential business opportunities.
32.

Although the Investor knew that SunTrust had acquired CSI, the

Investor continued to rely on Banks for investment advice and to communicate on
his behalf with SunTrust, including directing SunTrust how to allocate the capital
in his account among various investments.
33.

The Investor believed that Banks continued to receive compensation

from SunTrust for his services to him.
34.

Banks also continued to provide the Investor advice on private

investments, presenting to him various business opportunities for investment, as
well as continuing to serve in a more general role of advising the Investor on
business matters.
35.

Between 2007 and 2012, as a result of Banks's recommendations, the

Investor invested—in addition to the Gameday investment at issue here—
approximately $14 million in the Terroir Funds. Through these investments, the
Investor paid management fees to Banks's company Terroir, in exchange for
investment advice.
36.

The Investor also invested $1.1 million in Le Metier Beauty

Investment Partners, LLC ("Le Metier"), an entity affiliated with Banks that was
formed for the purpose of investing in Metier Tribeca, LLC, a luxury cosmetics
~3

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 9 of 30

company.
B.

The Gameday Offering

37.

In or about March 2012, Neal, Gameday's CEO,informed Banks that

Gameday required additional financing to fund its ongoing operations.
38.

At that time, Banks not only was Gameday's Chairman and largest

shareholder, but also its primary source for raising capital due to his connections
with professional sports team owners and athletes.
39.

Neal proposed to Banks that Gameday solicit two investors to invest

$7.5 million each for a term of five years, with each investor receiving in return
12% interest per annum, paid monthly, and warrants convertible to 5%common
equity.
40.

Neal further proposed that Gameday use approximately $5 million of

the total investment for working capital and the balance to pay off existing bank
debt so that both investors would have a senior security interest in Gameday's
inventory.
41.

Neal prepared a written presentation summarizing these terms to

market the offering, including that Gameday intended to have two investors and
that proceeds of the offering would be used to retire Gameday debt, and sent this
presentation to Banks.
42.

Thereafter, Neal undertook efforts to find investors for the offering

E

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 10 of 30

and, at the same time, he also requested that Banks solicit the Investor to be one of
the two investors.
43.

Between approximately May 2012 and October 2012, Banks solicited

the Investor to invest in Gameday's offering.
44.

Specifically, Banks conveyed to the Investor the terms of the offering

as proposed by Neal, emphasized that there would be very little risk due to the
security interest in the proposed collateral, and recommended that the Investor
make the investment.
45.

In a May 9, 2012 email to the Investor, Banks touted the offering by

telling the Investor that he had a "very good opportunity to run by [him]" that
would allow the Investor to "make a 10% spread" and "end up with equity in a
$SOm company."
46.

Banks also told the Investor that "[Gameday] has grown like crazy

and we have a chance to land all the merchandising for the Dodgers, so we need
cash to buy the inventory."
47.

Banks represented to the Investor that "the company would borrow

$4-7 M at 12% interest ...and the loan would be guaranteed and backed by
[Gameday's] long term contracts."
48.

Banks added that, while he "ha[s] a hedge fund lined up to do the

deal," he wanted to give the Investor the opportunity because it would be a
10

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 11 of 30

"homerun" for him.
49.

In a subsequent August 13, 2012 email to the Investor, Banks again

highlighted the investment's lack of risk, writing:

Jeff Neal, the CEO wants to replace the $7m loan we have
with [C]omerica [B]ank and add another $3M of capital. He
just sent me the final offer from a hedge fund to provide
$15M offinancing.... Based on the deal he sent me I can
get you a great deal (I can't do it because I am chairman). If
you loan the company $4-Sm (secured by our guaranteed
contracts and inventory) I can get you 12%interest ...and I
can get them to pay the interest up front each year. This
would be a 3 year loan and paid in full at the end of three
years. So you would take very little risk (because of the
security) and make 1.2-1.SM over the three years.
50.

Banks also assured the Investor that he would have a first lien position

on Gameday's collateral.
51.

The presentation materials that Banks gave to the Investor made clear

that this would occur as a result ofthe company's existing bank debt being paid
off.
52.

The Investor informed Banks that having a first lien position was

important to him.
53.

On September 5, 2012, Banks sent the Investor the written

presentation summarizing the offering that Neal had previously prepared and given
to Banks.

C.

Banks's Communications with SunTrust

54.

Shortly after Banks began soliciting the Investor to invest in

Gameday, Banks informed SunTrust of his recommendation.
55.

Banks told SunTrust that he had recommended to the Investor that he

borrow his investment funds from SunTrust, secured by the assets in his advisory
account, so that the Investor could profit from the spread between the interest he
would need to pay SunTrust and what the Investor purportedly would earn in
return from Gameday.
56.

SunTrust responded to Banks that it did not agree with the Investor

making the Gameday investment.
57.

SunTrust further objected to the Investor borrowing the funds to

invest in Gameday.
58.

SunTrust told Banks that its concerns arose from the lack of assurance

that Gameday would find a second investor and the result that the Investor would
not have a first security lien on Gameday's assets.
59.

SunTrust indicated to the Investor in an email dated September 28,

2012, that SunTrust had not evaluated the soundness of the proposed Gameday
investment. SunTrust advised the Investor to obtain counsel to review the
investment documents.
60.

Shortly after SunTrust's September 28, 2012 email to the Investor,

12

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 13 of 30

Banks reiterated to SunTrust his role with respect to the Investor's investments.
61.

Specifically, Banks first obtained the Investor's consent to open a

bank account in the Investor's name at Comerica Bank, and to move assets from
the Investor's SunTrust account to Comerica.
62.

Using the new Comerica account as collateral, Banks arranged with

Comerica for the Investor to obtain a $10 million secured line of credit.
63.

Banks then sent an October 17, 2012 email to SunTrust, in which he

wrote:
Gentlemen,[the Investor] asked me to clarify how he is
comfortable going forward. [The Investor] has been happy
with how we have done things for the last 16 years or so.
He would like to see a quarterly report that is clean, simple
and to the point. Explanation is only necessary when there
are extenuating circumstances. ... [The Investor] would
like me to receive the same communication he receives. He
would like me to work with Todd [the Investor's SunTrust
adviser] on the allocation and investment of his capital. For
private deals,[the Investor][sic] has set up an account at
[C]omerica [B]ank. In the future when he wishes to invest
in a private deal he will review with me and then transfer the
necessary cash to the [C]omerica account where he will
make the investment. This way it is clear that [S]untrust is
not advising him in this capacity.
64.

Banks copied the Investor on this email and concluded it by asking the

Investor to "please respond that these are your wishes."
65.

The next day, the Investor replied by email to all of the original

recipients, saying "[t]hat sounds good to me. Lets keep it simple. Thnx."

D.

The Investor's Investment In Gameday

66.

In mid-October 2012, based on Banks's representations, the Investor

agreed to invest $7.5 million in Gameday.
67.

On October 17, 2012,the Investor signed and returned to Neal a Note

and Warrant Purchase Agreement, a Secured Promissory Note, and a Security
Agreement (collectively,"Gameday note"), which memorialized the Investor's
$7.5 million investment in Gameday.
68.

The Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement ultimately included both:

(1) a promissory note with a maturity of five years, paying interest of 12%per
annum (paid monthly); and (2) a stock warrant convertible into 3% of Gameday
common equity.
69.

The Security Agreement represented that Gameday shall "keep the

[c]ollateral free from any adverse claims, liens, security interests, or encumbrances
(other than security interest of[the Investor])."
70.

At the same time, the Investor also signed and returned a Warrant to

Purchase Units which gave the Investor the right to obtain a three percent equity
interest in Gameday at a nominal price within five years.
71.

Two days later, on October 19, 2012, Banks emailed Neal to tell him

that the Investor's funds for the investment would shortly be transferred to
Comerica Bank and directed Gameday to pay him a 3%origination fee, or

14

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 15 of 30

$225,000, for arranging the Investor's investment.
72.

In the same email, Banks also told Neal that Gameday needed to pay

him or Hammer Holdings, LLC — a company that Banks jointly owns with another
individual —accrued fees and other amounts due, totaling $358,000.
73.

Finally, Banks informed Neal that, starting in 2013, his yearly

consulting fee from Gameday would increase from $150,000 to $250,000 per year.
74.

At the time, Neal was telling Banks that he was on the verge of

obtaining funds from a group of foreign investors, who would constitute the second
investor for the offering.
75.

Neal asked Banks when the Investor's money would be transferred to

Gameday.
76.

Banks told Neal that he would not release the Investor's funds until

Gameday had received the $7.5 million from the second investor because Banks
knew the second investment was important to the Investor as it was necessary to
enable Gameday to pay off its existing debt and give the Investor a first lien on
Gameday's assets.
77.

In an October 24, 2012 e-mail to Neal, Banks stated, "[the Investor] is

VERY worried (I'm sure based on SunTrust's comments)that the [second investor
isn't] real and that he's being misled into funding."
78.

However, the next day, October 25, 2012, Banks directed Comerica to

15

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 16 of 30

draw down $7.5 million on the Investor's line of credit and wire those funds on the
Investor's behalf to Gameday.
79.

Despite knowing that the second investment was important to the

Investor, at the time of his instructions to Comerica, Banks knew that Gameday
had not received the second investment.
80.

Banks also knew that if he did not transfer the money at that time, his

approval from the Investor for the wire transfer would expire and Banks might
have difficulty obtaining a new approval from the Investor.
81.

Banks expressed this concern to Neal in an October 25, 2012 email, in

which Banks told Neal: "I need to send [the Investor's] wire today or we have to
get him on the phone to approve, which could be tough. If I send wire, pls [sic]
don't touch until the [second investor] fund[s]."
82.

Gameday did not receive any funds from a second investor.

83.

Nevertheless, on November 1, 2012, Banks instructed Neal to pay him

the money they had agreed upon, including the $225,000 origination fee for
obtaining the Investor's investment.
84.

On November 2, 2012, Banks told Neal by email to pay to him 20%

of the Investor's monthly interest payments, or $15,000 of the $75,000 due
monthly to the Investor from Gameday.
85.

In instructing Neal to send him a portion of the Investor's monthly
16

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 17 of 30

return, Banks falsely told. Neal that he had obtained the Investor's agreement to
this arrangement.
86.

In a November 2, 2012 email to Neal, Banks wrote: "Btw,I got him

to agree to pay me 20% on the Gameday deal. So every month I need 20% to go to
[Banks's bank account]. Plus I get 20% of the stock he picks up (which I can toss
into the pot for you and me)."
87.

The Investor did not agree to pay Banks any portion of his interest

payments and Banks did not disclose to the Investor that Gameday would pay 20%
of the Investor's interest payments to Banks. Banks also did not disclose to the
Investor that he was earning a 3%origination fee for the Investor's investment.
88.

In addition, Banks did not disclose to the Investor that the second

investment never materialized and that, as a result, Gameday had not paid off its
existing bank debt.
89.

The Investor's investment in Gameday was subordinated to

Gameday's existing bank debt.
90.

The subordination of the Investor's investment in Gameday was

contrary to Banks's representations to the Investor and the Investor's wishes.
91.

At approximately this same time, Banks also recommended that the

Investor invest in Le Metier.
92.

In making this recommendation, Banks touted the company's fragrance
17

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 18 of 30

as the "hottest in New York at Bergdorf, Saks, and Niemans;" Banks noted his strong
relationship with the CEO ofthe company; and Banks claimed that he and another
professional athlete, among others, were also investing in it.
93.

The Investor accepted Banks's recommendation to invest in Le Metier.

94.

On October 25;2012 —the same day that Banks transferred the

Investor's funds to Gameday —Banks also invested $1.1 million ofthe Investor's
funds in Le Metier.
95.

Banks again used the Investor's line of credit at Comerica to make the

investment.
96.

Banks received compensation for the Investor's investment in Le Metier

by obtaining anon-binding letter ofintent from the company to award Banks
exclusive distribution rights in Asia.
E.

The June 2013 Gameday Loan Guaranty and Subordination

97.

Even with the Investor's investment, Gameday needed additional

funding.
98.

On December 4, 2012, Gameday made a 30-day loan to Banks of

$950,000.
99.

Banks did not repay this loan.

100. On December 20, 2012, Gameday made an additional, 30-day loan of
$1.5 million to Hammer Holdings, a company that is controlled by Banks and

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 19 of 30

another individual.
101. Hammer Holdings did not repay this loan.
102. In January 2013, Gameday defaulted on a loan the company had with
Comerica.
103. This loan was personally guaranteed by the individual who controlled
Hammer Holdings with Banks, and was secured by that individual's assets on
deposit at the bank.
104. After several months of negotiation, Comerica agreed to allow
Gameday to restructure the loan and establish a new line of credit, provided that it
again is secured by a personal guarantee.
105. The individual who had guaranteed the original loan to Gameday no
longer wanted to be the guarantor.
106. Beginning in May 2013, Banks and Neal undertook efforts to have the
Investor become the guarantor of the new financing from Comerica.
107. In a May 5, 2013 email exchange with Neal, Banks stated,"[w]onder
if I can get [the Investor] to replace [the original guarantor] on the guarantee?
Without having to move more money over there?"
108. In the same email exchange, Banks later observed that: "I need to be
careful asking as I don't want to make him nervous. Ask [Comerica's loan officer]
what he would need from [the Investor]."

19

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 20 of 30

109. Neal then emailed the Comerica loan officer, saying,"[Banks] said
that he can get [the Investor] to take over the guaranty, but he doesn't want to have
to move any more money in right now. He thinks that would cause a red flag."
110. On June 4, 2013, after Comerica had agreed to accept [the Investor's]
guaranty without the Investor depositing additional funds, Banks directed
Comerica to send him the guaranty agreement and an agreement subordinating the
Investor's $7.5 million investment to the new line of credit.
111. Banks also directed the Comerica loan officer to send only the
signature pages of both agreements to the Investor, who at the time was in Miami,
Florida.
112. On the same day, Banks told the Investor to sign and return the
signature pages.
113. Although the pages had legends that said "Signature Page to [the
Investor] Guarantee" and "Signature Page to Subordination Agreement,"
respectively, Banks did not tell the Investor that he was signing a guarantee and a
subordination document.
114. Instead, Banks informed the Investor in a text message that:
"[o]n the good news front Gameday is crushing. We are
changing your 7.Sm loan to 6m. Paying it down 1.Sm.
Sending you an amendment to the loan I need you to send
back when you get it."
115. The Investor replied,"[w]hy are we changing the loan?? If its

crushing should I get more of the company?? Or at least what's agreed upon??
I'm confused."
116. Banks answered the Investor by stating:
"[m]y fault for not explaining more clearly. Your exposure
is going down but your upside remain and your monthly
payments remain. This just removes 1.Sm of risk for you.
All great news. No downside."
117. Following Banks's representations, the Investor signed and returned
the signature pages without asking to read the full documents or questioning Banks
further.
118. Banks's statements to the Investor in the above text messages were
false and deceptive.
119. The Investor did not reduce his investment by $1.5 million by signing
the guarantee and subordination documents.
120. Instead, by signing the documents, the Investor significantly increased
his exposure to Gameday's risk of default, while subordinating his earlier
investment to the new line of credit.
121. Shortly after the new Comerica line of credit was secured, Banks
directed Gameday to pay him the 3% "guarantee fee," or at least $180,000, that
Gameday was willing to pay the Investor as consideration for providing the
guarantee.
122. Banks did not disclose this 3% "guarantee fee" to the investor.

123. In exchange for providing investment advice to the Investor, Banks
was compensated by paying himself 20% of the Investor's monthly interest
payments.
F.

Banks's Fraud Is Exposed

124. In or about March 2013,the Investor became involved in divorce
proceedings.
125. As part ofthose proceedings, the Investor's divorce attorney
questioned Neal about the Investor's Gameday investment, including why the
Investor was receiving less than he was owed each month.
126. Neal drafted a response in which he explained that 20% of the
Investor's monthly interest payment was being paid to Banks.
127. However, when Neal previewed his response with Banks before
sending it to the Investor's attorney, Banks promptly told Neal to delete reference
to the 20%being paid to him.
128. Over the next several weeks, the Investor's attorney pressed Neal for
an explanation of the discrepancy.
129. At one point, Banks told Neal to tell the attorney falsely that the 20%
was being withheld as "deferred compensation."
130. The Investor's attorney asked for documents reflecting the deferred
compensation arrangement. Banks and Neal could not provide the Investor's
22

Case 1:16-cv-03399-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/09/16 Page 23 of 30

attorney with such documents because they do not exist.
131. Eventually, Banks and Neal disclosed that a portion of the Investor's
return had been diverted to Banks over the course ofthe investment.
132. Following this disclosure, Banks agreed to pay the Investor the
amount that he had diverted.
133. However, instead of paying the money to the Investor himself, Banks
instructed Neal to pay the funds from Gameday and told Neal to credit the amount
paid to the Investor against unspecified amounts due to Banks from Gameday.
134. To date, none of the Investor's investment has been returned to him.
