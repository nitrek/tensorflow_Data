A.

SUMMARY

1.
This matter involves violations of federal securities laws and improper professional
conduct by PW India while PW Bangalore served as auditor of record for Satyam Computer
Services Limited (“Satyam”) from 2005 through January 2009. In connection with Satyam’s 2005­
2008 publicly-filed financial statements, Satyam engaged in fraudulent financial accounting by
falsifying the company’s revenue, income, earnings per share, cash, and interest bearing deposits.
Satyam acknowledged that it falsely reported over $1 billion in revenue and cash, among other
items, in its publicly filed financial statements. In January 2009, Satyam submitted a Form 6-K
with the Commission indicating that “Price Waterhouse’s audit reports and opinions in relation to
Satyam’s financial statements from the quarter ended June 30, 2000 until the quarter ended
September 30, 2008 should no longer be relied upon.”
2.
Former officers and senior managers at Satyam, an Indian information technology
service company with depository shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) during
the relevant period, directed the creation of over 6,000 false invoices that they ensured were entered
into the company’s general ledger and falsely recorded as, among other things, revenue, income,
and accounts receivable in Satyam’s publicly filed financial statements. Former senior management
at Satyam manufactured scores of false bank statements, confirmations, and supporting documents

2

Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent part, that: “[t]he Commission may censure a person or deny, temporarily
or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is found . . . to have engaged
in unethical or improper professional conduct.”

3

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents' Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

to reflect payment of the false invoices and created over $1 billion in fictitious cash balances and
other interest bearing deposits. This false information made Satyam appear to be substantially more
profitable and financially sound than was actually the case. When the fraud was revealed, the price
of Satyam’s depository shares plummeted and institutional investors located in the United States
sustained realized losses of over $450 million.
3.
PW Bangalore issued unqualified opinions on Satyam’s March 31, 2005, March 31,
2006, March 31, 2007, and March 31, 2008 financial statements. Each of these audit reports stated
that “Price Waterhouse” conducted its audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in the United States (“GAAS”) and that Satyam’s financial statements were presented in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Each audit report also stated
that the underlying audit was conducted in accordance with Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) Standards. Contrary to the audit reports, PW India did not conduct
Satyam’s audits in accordance with PCAOB Standards, which is now understood to include
GAAS.4 Specifically, the PW India partners and staff on the Satyam engagement team (“Satyam
engagement team” or “engagement team”) failed to maintain control of the confirmation process
with respect to cash and cash equivalent balances as well as Satyam’s accounts receivables. The
failure to properly execute third-party confirmation procedures resulted in the fraud at Satyam
going undetected until the former chairman’s public confession in January 2009.
4.
The failures in the confirmation process on the Satyam audit were not limited to
that engagement, but were indicative of a quality control failure throughout PW India. During the
relevant period, PW India’s quality control system failed to detect that engagement teams
throughout PW India routinely relinquished control of the delivery and receipt of cash
confirmations to their audit clients and rarely, if ever, questioned the integrity of the confirmation
responses they received from the clients. Despite annual quality reviews, PW India did not
recognize this compliance failure until after January 2009.
5.
By failing to comply with PCAOB Standards, PW Bangalore issued audit reports
in connection with the Satyam engagement that were not accurate and, as a result, the PW India
Firms were a cause of Satyam’s issuing materially false and misleading financial statements and its
violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20,
13a-1 and 13a-16 thereunder. The PW India Firms also violated Section 10A(a) of the Exchange
Act by failing to conduct procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal
acts that would have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement
amounts.

PW India and the five other India-based PwC Network Firms operate their audit
practices under resource sharing arrangements that facilitate the provision of audit services as a
network of related firms. With respect to the PW India Firms, pursuant to these arrangements,
Lovelock and PW Calcutta have both partners and staff who perform audit procedures and provide
staffing for their own audit engagements, as well as for engagements of the other PW India Firms.
The partners of the remaining PW India Firms, PW Bangalore, PW Co. Bangalore, and PW Co.
Calcutta, undertake audit engagements, oversee the audit work conducted by engagement personnel,
and sign audit opinions. PW India partners typically are affiliated with several firms within the
domestic network of audit firms simultaneously. During the relevant period, PW India and the
other domestic India-based firms shared resources and settled inter-firm balances at the end of each
fiscal year.
14.
PW India and the five other India-based PwC Network Firms operate in a manner
that generally does not make any distinctions among the individual firms in the network. For
example, the PW India Firms share office space and have identical telephone numbers. In addition,
the Respondents’ website makes no obvious distinction among the individual PwC Network Firms
located in India.
15.
Satyam’s Forms 20-F during the relevant period list the company’s independent
registered public accounting firm as “Price Waterhouse,” the name of PW Bangalore set forth in its
partnership deed. During the relevant period, the Satyam audit reports were signed by PW
Bangalore engagement partners who were also partners at Lovelock.7 Audit work on the Satyam
engagement was performed predominately by partners and staff associated with these firms,
although staff from PW Calcutta and partners of all five PW India firms billed time on the Satyam
audits during the relevant period.

Satyam Computer Services Limited (“Satyam”) is a large information technology
service company incorporated in India with its principal executive offices in Hyderabad. Satyam’s
equity shares trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India.
Satyam also has 65 million American Depository Shares (“ADS”) representing approximately 11
percent of the company’s equity shares. At all relevant times, Satyam’s equity shares underlying
the ADS were registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Satyam’s ADS were
listed on the NYSE. On October 4, 2010, Satyam filed a Form 25 with the Commission
voluntarily removing its securities from listing on the NYSE and from registration under Section
12(b). Satyam’s equity shares underlying the ADS are currently deemed registered pursuant to
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and Satyam’s ADS are currently quoted on the OTC Market
under the symbol SAYCY.PK.

17.
Shortly after the fraud became public, the Government of India assumed control of
the company. In mid-February 2009, the Company Law Board of India authorized the company to
select a strategic investor for Satyam. As a result of the bidding process, Tech Mahindra Limited,
an Indian information technology competitor, through its subsidiary Venturbay Consultants Private
Limited, purchased approximately 42 percent of Satyam’s shares in India and became the new
controlling shareholder of Satyam. In June 2009, Satyam filed a press release announcing
“Mahindra Satyam” as the company’s new “brand identity.” The company continues to conduct
business in the United States as Satyam and is registered as a corporation doing business in the
State of New York and as a foreign private issuer with the Commission under the name Satyam.
D.

FACTS

18.
In connection with fiscal years 2005 through 2008, as well as earlier years, Satyam
engaged in certain practices relating to its revenue, income, cash, interest-bearing deposits, and
accounts receivable that made its financial statements materially false and misleading. PW India’s
audits of Satyam’s financial statements for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 were deficient. Among
other things, PW India departed from applicable PCAOB Standards by failing to maintain control of
the confirmation process with respect to cash, interest bearing deposits, and accounts receivable
balances. As a result, PW India failed to uncover Satyam’s fraud and, instead, issued unqualified
audit opinions in connection with its audits of Satyam’s financial statements until its former
Chairman admitted that the company had been engaged in a billion dollar financial fraud and
Satyam publicly disclosed that admission in a Form 6-K. As indicated herein, the failures PW India
experienced on the Satyam audit were not limited to that engagement, but were indicative of a
quality control failure throughout PW India.
Satyam’s Accounting Fraud
19.
Satyam falsified its reported revenue by manufacturing false invoices for services
never provided and, in some cases, for customers that did not exist. From at least 2005 through
2008, Satyam’s former senior management instructed certain employees to generate thousands of
false invoices and record them in the company’s invoice management system. The invoice
management system exported the fake invoices into Satyam’s financial system where the revenues
were recorded in the company’s general ledger. Based upon the fictitious invoices, Satyam
materially overstated revenue and net income from at least fiscal year 2005 through the first two
quarters of fiscal year 2009 by over $1 billion.
20.
To support the false revenue and income that Satyam was reporting in its financial
statements, Satyam prepared materially false bank statements, from at least fiscal year 2005 through
2008, reflecting materially false cash deposits in the company’s bank accounts at, among other
places, the Bank of Baroda (“BOB”), which were recorded within the cash and cash equivalent
balances in Satyam’s publicly-filed financial statements.
21.
To make it appear that Satyam was investing its false income during the relevant
time period, Satyam’s former senior management manufactured scores of false bank statements and
6


also materially falsified the company’s publicly filed financial statements with regard to the balance
and fixed deposit receipts (hereinafter “interest bearing deposits”) and corresponding interest
income in accounts held at HSBC, BNP Paribas, HDFC, Citibank, and ICICI.
22.
In Satyam’s 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 financial statements, the company reported,
among other assets, balance sheet line items entitled (a) “cash and cash equivalents,” and (b)
investments in bank deposits” (collectively, the “cash” line items). During these years, Satyam’s
cash line items represented the largest asset on its reported balance sheet, making up 50% or more
of Satyam’s total assets during the relevant period. For example, in 2008, Satyam reported cash of
$1.1 billion, constituting approximately 50 percent of total reported assets. The vast majority of the
cash purportedly was on deposit at BOB, HSBC, BNP Paribas, HDFC, Citibank, and ICICI.
23.
On January 7, 2009, Satyam submitted a Form 6-K with the Commission that
included a letter prepared by the then-Chairman of Satyam, B. Ramalinga Raju (“Raju”), admitting
that the company had been engaged in a billion dollar fraud. According to Raju’s letter, as of
September 30, 2008, Satyam’s balance sheet reflected over $1 billion in fictitious cash and bank
balances when the actual amount was $66 million.
24.
On January 14, 2009, Satyam submitted a Form 6-K with the Commission
indicating that “Price Waterhouse” had advised that all audit reports and opinions in relation to
Satyam’s financial statements during the relevant period should no longer be relied upon.
25.
On February 21, 2009, Satyam submitted a Form 6-K with the Commission
indicating that Satyam’s Board of Directors accepted the resignation of “Price Waterhouse” as
Satyam’s independent auditor.
26.
The two PW India lead engagement partners for the Satyam audits during the
relevant period are defendants, along with a significant number of former senior and mid-level
executives of Satyam, including the former Chairman, the former Managing Director and Chief
Executive Officer, and the former Chief Financial Officer, in a criminal trial in India arising out of
the Satyam fraud. The trial is underway. The two PW India engagement partners have also been
the subject of ongoing disciplinary matters in India before the ICAI and the Securities and
Exchange Board of India involving their role in the Satyam audit. The two PW India lead partners
and the two PW India senior managers who were the engagement managers on the Satyam audits
during the relevant period were relieved of all auditing responsibilities in January 2009. The two
engagement managers resigned in February 2010 and the lead engagement partner for the audits of
Satyam’s fiscal years ended March 1999-2007 retired in March 2009. The lead engagement
partner for the audit of Satyam’s fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 is on administrative leave from
PW India pending the outcome of the various proceedings against him. On March 16, 2010, the
two former PW India engagement managers were barred by the PCAOB from being associated
persons of a registered public accounting firm for their failure to comply with a demand requiring
their testimony in a PCAOB-related investigation into the Satyam audit engagements. These PW
India managers are also the subject of ongoing disciplinary proceedings before the ICAI.

PW India’s Audits of Cash and Cash Equivalent Balances
Were Not Performed in Accordance with PCAOB Standards
for Fiscal Years 2005-2008
27.
Respondents failed to identify the material overstatement of Satyam’s assets, in part,
because the engagement team failed to carry out the confirmation processes and procedures related
to cash and interest bearing deposits in accordance with PCAOB Standards -- and its own audit
plan -- for fiscal years 2005-2008. PCAOB Standards require, among other things, that auditors
test the existence and valuation of reported cash and interest bearing deposit balances. In order to
test the cash and interest bearing deposit balances during the relevant period, the audit plans for
each year during the relevant period called for the confirmation of Satyam’s major bank balances
and interest bearing deposits with third parties. The working papers for each year during the
relevant period document that the engagement team confirmed cash balances and interest bearing
deposits for all banks at which Satyam had “major” accounts.
28.
Respondents failed to make direct contact with either BOB, the New York branch
that held Satyam’s purported largest bank account, or the five largest banks purportedly holding
Satyam’s interest bearing deposits to confirm the cash and cash equivalent balances that Satyam
reported in its financial statements. Instead, and in violation of PCAOB Standards, the
engagement team relied on the company’s senior management to mail out confirmation requests to
Satyam’s banks, and on the purported responses to those letters from the banks, including
purported responses provided to the engagement team by Satyam management. Respondents
never attempted to contact the banks directly at any time during the audits.
29.
Respondents also failed to conduct appropriate inquiry after receiving
confirmations directly from banks that were potentially conflicting with those received from
Satyam management. During the fiscal year 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 audits, the Satyam
engagement team received confirmations, in the requested format, directly from branches of certain
banks that purportedly held Satyam’s largest interest bearing fixed deposit balances. The
engagement team also received confirmations from Satyam’s management that purported to
confirm fixed deposit balances at a different branch of the same bank. The confirmations received
from Satyam management were not in the format requested by the engagement team. The bankprovided confirmation responses reflected significantly lesser cash balances than Satyam
management represented to be held in fixed deposits at the same banks, and significantly lesser
cash balances than what was reflected in the purported bank confirmations that Satyam provided to
the engagement team. The engagement team could have, but did not, contact the banks directly to
determine the amounts that Satyam had on deposit with the banks. Had the engagement team done
so, such inquiry should have revealed that cash and cash equivalent balances reported in Satyam’s
financial statements were significantly overstated. The following chart provides several examples
of these differences:

30.
Rather than contact the banks to obtain an explanation for the differences, the
engagement team erroneously accepted both confirmations as genuine and purported to
“corroborate” the interest bearing fixed deposit balances with fabricated fixed deposit receipts and
other support supplied by Satyam.
31.
Respondents did not reconcile this potentially conflicting audit evidence during the
fiscal years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. After the fraud was revealed, members of the Satyam
engagement team indicated that they had ceded control of the confirmation process to the client
and relied on Satyam’s representations, in large part, because they believed that Satyam’s former
chairman and senior management were honest and that they did not suspect that Satyam was
fabricating audit documents. Members of the Satyam engagement team conceded that, in
hindsight, the confirmation process they employed for the Satyam audits was not in compliance
with PCAOB Standards.
32.
During Satyam’s fiscal year 2008 audit, a partner from another PwC Network Firm
outside of India (“The PwC Network Firm Partner”) alerted members of the Satyam engagement
team that its cash confirmation procedures appeared substantially deficient. Specifically, in May
2008, in response to questions raised by the “Appendix K filing reviewer” of Satyam’s draft Form
20-F,8 PW India requested that the PwC Network Firm Partner review the electronic workpapers

8

Under Rule 3400T(b), Interim Quality Control Standards, audit firms must comply with portions of the
Requirements of Membership of the AICPA SEC Practice Section (“SECPS”). Audit firms associated with
international firms are required to seek the adoption of policies and procedures consistent with the objectives set

9


for the 2008 Satyam audit. In response to that request, the PwC Network Firm Partner provided
the Satyam engagement team with a detailed set of comments, including remarks on the cash and
interest bearing deposit confirmation workpapers. In particular, the PwC Network Firm Partner
informed the Satyam engagement team that their cash confirmation procedures appeared
inadequate because the working papers indicated that “the confirmation was obtained either
directly or from copies obtained from the client. We can only take credit for confirms we send and
receive directly.”
33.
Notwithstanding the above-described warnings it received from the PwC Network
Firm Partner, the Satyam engagement team failed to take any corrective action to confirm
Satyam’s cash and cash equivalent balances in a manner that complied with PCAOB Standards
during the fiscal year 2008 audit. Had direct confirmation of the BOB bank balances been
performed in response to the PwC Network Firm Partner’s comment, Satyam’s fraud could have
been uncovered in the summer of 2008.
34.
Respondents failed to perform the 2005-2008 Satyam audits with respect to cash
and cash equivalent balances in accordance with PCAOB Standards. First, Respondents failed to
maintain control over confirmation requests and responses by establishing direct communication
between the intended recipient and the auditor to minimize the possibility that the results will be
biased because of interception and alteration of the confirmation requests or responses, as required
by PCAOB Standard AU § 330.28. Second, Respondents failed to exercise appropriate
professional skepticism throughout the confirmation process, as required by PCAOB Standard AU
§ 330.15. Third, Respondents failed to comply with PCAOB Standards AU § 333.02 and 326.01
when it neglected to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to afford a reasonable basis to
determine the accuracy and completeness of the cash and cash equivalent balances reported in the
financial statements. Instead, Respondents repeatedly substituted management representations for
competent evidence, which also does not comply with PCAOB Standards AU § 333.02 and
326.01. Fourth, Respondents failed to take appropriate action in response to warning signs
regarding the sufficiency of the cash confirmation procedures and caused the issuance of
inaccurate audit reports, which resulted from a failure to comply with the several PCAOB
Standards, including AU § 230.07 (“[d]ue professional care requires the auditor to exercise
professional skepticism. Professional skepticism is an attitude that includes a questioning mind
and a critical assessment of audit evidence.”) and AU § 230.09 (“[i]n exercising professional
skepticism, the auditor should not be satisfied with less than persuasive evidence because of a
belief that management is honest.”).9 The failure to properly execute third-party confirmation
procedures contributed to the fraud at Satyam going undetected for years.

Deficiencies in the Cash Confirmation Process 

Occurred Throughout PW India

35.
From at least 2008 forward, the failures in the confirmation process on the Satyam
audit were not limited to that engagement, but were indicative of a quality control failure
throughout PW India. In a large number of other audit engagements conducted by PW India, its
auditors planned to test the existence and valuation of cash balances by performing direct
confirmations, and then failed to control the confirmation process by relying on audit clients for
confirmation requests and responses. PW India’s quality control system failed to detect that, for
several years, and on multiple audit engagements, audit personnel at PW India were not complying
with PCAOB standards governing the cash confirmation process.
36.
PW India staff conceded that they routinely relinquished control of the delivery and
receipt of cash confirmations entirely to their audit clients and rarely, if ever, questioned the
integrity of the confirmation responses they received from the client by following up with the banks
prior to January 2009. Similarly, PW India partners, including a partner formerly responsible for
audit risk and quality throughout PW India, indicated that client involvement in the confirmation
process during the relevant period was the norm because bankers rarely, if ever, responded directly
to confirmation requests made by auditors.
37.
Despite annual quality reviews, PW India did not recognize the extensive nature of
this quality control failure until after January 2009, when PW India conducted a firm-wide review
of confirmation workpapers taken from completed and ongoing engagements for the current and
prior fiscal year.
PW India’s Audits of Accounts Receivable Balances

Were Not Performed in Accordance with PCAOB Standards 

for Fiscal Years 2006-2008

38.
During the relevant period, Satyam’s former senior management recorded fictitious
receivables by exploiting weaknesses in the internal controls of the company’s accounts receivable
system. Specifically, the company’s invoicing system allowed for the manual entry of customer
invoices via the intervention of a “super user,” acting outside the regular controls of the billing and
invoicing process. Satyam’s former senior management used this super user function to create
thousands of fake invoices totaling over $1 billion during the entirety of the fraud.
39.
For the 2006-2008 fiscal year audits, Respondents failed to carry out the audits of
the accounts receivable balance in accordance with PCAOB Standards. As with the cash
confirmation process, the Satyam engagement team did not maintain control of the accounts
receivable confirmations and did not perform adequate follow-up procedures on confirmations that
were sent but not received from customers with purported accounts receivable balances recorded
on Satyam’s 2006-2008 fiscal year end financial statements.
11


40.
For example, from the period March 31, 2006 through August 31, 2007, the Satyam
engagement team prepared accounts receivable confirmation requests on five occasions but
received few, if any, responses to those requests. During the relevant period, Respondents made
no attempt to follow up on those non-responses. Further, as part of the 2007 fiscal year audit, the
engagement team sent out confirmation requests to 22 customers with outstanding receivables
balances on August 31, 2006, including seven that were later exposed as fictitious customers. No
customers responded to those requests. Appropriate diligence and follow-up procedures could
have exposed the true nature of these customers.
41.
In other periods, instead of employing confirmation procedures to verify accounts
receivable balances, the Satyam engagement team purported to implement “alternative procedures”
to validate receivables through an attempt to verify their subsequent receipts. The subsequent
receipt totals were obtained from Satyam’s management and then divided by the total outstanding
receivables as of the period end to arrive at a percentage of receivables that had been subsequently
collected. There was no other documented substantive analysis to go along with this calculation.
The above-described alternative audit procedures performed during the 2006-2008 fiscal audit
years did not provide adequate audit evidence to corroborate the existence of receivables because
they were not designed to ensure that the subsequent receipts had any relationship to the actual
outstanding receivables at the end of the respective fiscal year.
42.
Further, the engagement team was aware of factors that increased the potential for
fraud at Satyam during at least the fiscal year 2007 audit, but failed to recognize the increased risk,
and therefore did not alter its planning and execution of the Satyam audits to take these risks into
account as required under PCAOB Standards. In connection with the audit of the company’s fiscal
year ended March 31, 2007, PW India’s Systems and Process Assurance (“SPA”) personnel tested
Satyam’s Information Technology (“IT”) internal controls. This testing revealed over 170
deficiencies in those controls, including eight significant deficiencies identified by the SPA team.
The nature of these deficiencies should have alerted the engagement team to a heightened risk with
respect to receivables.
43.
In an area that called for increased audit vigilance, Respondents failed to develop an
audit plan that addressed the increased risk of a material misstatement of the receivables balance.
Instead, the 2007 and 2008 year-end audits excluded confirmation of the year-end receivables
balances.
44.
Respondents failed to adequately plan and perform the 2006-2008 audits with
respect to accounts receivable in accordance with relevant PCAOB Standards. First, the
engagement team ignored internal control deficiencies which should have alerted it to the
heightened fraud risk with respect to receivables, as required by PCAOB Standards AU § 312.16
(an auditor must consider the effect of an assessment of the risk of material misstatement due to

12


fraud on the overall audit strategy).10 Second, the receivables audit plan failed to address an
increased risk of a material misstatement of the receivables balance, as required by PCAOB
Standard AU § 312.17 (higher risk may cause the auditor to expand or modify the extent or nature
of procedures to obtain more persuasive evidence). Third, the engagement team failed to follow up
on confirmation requests that were not returned, which resulted in a failure to comply with several
PCAOB Standards, including AU § 316.28 (describing instances in which audit procedures need to
be changed to obtain evidence that is more reliable or to obtain additional corroborative
information, including from independent sources), §330.30 (describing follow-up confirmation
request process), and §330.32 (describing alternative procedures to be employed in the
examination of accounts receivable, including the matching of subsequent cash receipts with the
actual items being paid). Fourth, Respondents did not obtain sufficient competent evidential
matter to verify the existence of receivables, as required by PCAOB Standard AU § 326.01.11
Failure to Issue Accurate Audit Reports
45.
PCAOB Standards require that the auditor’s report contain an opinion on the
financial statements taken as a whole and contain a clear indication of the character of the auditor’s
work. PCAOB Standard AU § 508.04. The auditor can determine that he or she is able to issue an
audit report containing an unqualified opinion only if he has conducted his audit in accordance
with PCAOB Standards and that the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
GAAP. PCAOB Standard AU §§ 508.08, 508.14.12
46.
PW India acted unreasonably in rendering audit reports containing unqualified
opinions for the fiscal year 2005-2008 publicly-filed financial statements. PW India issued audit
reports on Satyam’s financial statements even though they should have known that Satyam’s audits
had not been conducted in accordance with PCAOB Standards and that Satyam’s financial
statements did not present fairly, in all material respects, Satyam’s financial position, operating
results, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP.
PW India Did Not Comply with PCAOB Auditing Standard No.3.
47.
PW India was notified by the PCAOB in November 2007 that the PCAOB would
perform an inspection of PW India. This inspection was to include a review of PW India’s 2007
fiscal year audit of Satyam. The audit opinion included in Satyam’s 2007 Form 20-F was dated

10

See also PCAOB Standard AU § 110.02, which requires that an “auditor has the responsibility to plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud.”

11

See also PCAOB Standards AU § 150.02 and AU § 230, which require due professional care to be exercised in the
performance of the audit and preparation of the report.

12

PCAOB Standard AU § 508.14 was in effect for reports issued from the beginning of the relevant period until
November 15, 2008.

13


and released on April 27, 2007. Satyam submitted its Form 20-F to the SEC on April 30, 2007.
The PCAOB inspection began in February 2008.
48.
Under PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3, Audit Documentation (“AS No. 3”), audit
documentation may not be deleted after the document completion date (i.e, the date that the
“complete and final set of audit documentation” has been assembled for retention, which must
occur within 45 days after the audit report release date). AS No. 3 ¶15. AS No. 3 also requires
that an auditor make certain written disclosures if the auditor adds or alters working papers after
the documentation completion date. In particular, AS No. 3 specifies, in relevant part, that any
additions or alterations to audit documentation after the audit report release date “must indicate the
date the information was added, the name of the person who prepared the additional
documentation, and the reason for adding it.” AS No. 3 ¶16.
49.
After the audit “documentation completion date,” but before the PCAOB inspection
of the Satyam audit for fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, members of the Satyam engagement
team created certain documents, and gathered other documents, none of which previously were in
the 2007 Satyam audit workpapers. The workpapers added by the Satyam engagement team
included the management letter and debtor confirmation requests. The added workpapers did not
include any notations indicating that they were added or altered after the documentation
completion date. The added workpapers also neglected to provide the date the information was
added, the name of the person who prepared the additional documentation, and the reason for
adding it. Accordingly, PW India failed to comply with AS No.3 ¶¶ 15, 16.
E.

VIOLATIONS
Because of Its Failure to Comply With PCAOB Standards, 

PW India Was a Cause of Satyam’s Violations of Sections 13(a) and

13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act and Relevant Rules Thereunder


50.
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-16 thereunder require
issuers with registered securities to file and furnish factually accurate annual and other reports.
Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act requires that, in addition to the information expressly required
to be included in such reports, the reports shall contain such further material information as may
be necessary to ensure that the required statements are not misleading. As a foreign private
issuer, Satyam is required to file annual reports on Form 20-F pursuant to Rule 13a-1 under the
Exchange Act and to furnish reports on Form 6-K pursuant to Rule 13a-16 under the Exchange
Act. The information required by Form 6-K is whatever information the registrant makes, or is
required to make, public pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction of its domicile or in which the
registrant is incorporated or organized. The obligation to furnish these periodic reports includes
the obligation that they be true and correct in all material respects. See, e.g., SEC v. IMC
International, Inc., 384 F.Supp. 889, 893 (N.D. Texas), aff’d mem. 505 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1974),
cert. denied sub nom. No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section
13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-16, and 12b-20 thereunder.
14


51.
Under Section 21C of the Exchange Act, the Commission may “enter an order
requiring such person, and any other person that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due
to an act or omission the person knew or should have known would contribute to such violation,
to cease and desist from committing or causing such violation and any future violation of the
same provision, rule, or regulation.” Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3. Negligence is sufficient
to establish liability for causing a primary violation that does not require scienter. See KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP, 74 SEC Docket 384, 421 (2001), recon. denied, 74 SEC Docket 1351 (Mar.
8, 2001), pet. denied, 289 F.3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002), reh'g en banc denied, 2002 U.S. App. Lexis
14543 (July 16, 2002).
52.
Satyam violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-16
thereunder by including in numerous of its periodic filings and submissions financial statements
for the years 2005-2008 that were materially false and misleading. For each of those years, PW
India issued audit reports containing unqualified opinions stating that “Price Waterhouse”
conducted an audit of the company’s annual financial statements in accordance with PCAOB
Standards, that Satyam’s financial reporting was in conformity with GAAP, and that Satyam’s
reporting results fairly represented the financial condition of the company. PW India consented to
the inclusion of these audit reports in Satyam’s Forms 20-F for fiscal years 2005 through 2008.
However, PW India’s audit reports were inaccurate because PW India failed to conduct its audits in
accordance with PCAOB Standards. PW India’s failure to comply with PCAOB Standards was a
cause of Satyam’s violations, including Satyam’s failure to disclose to investors that it was
engaged in non-GAAP and other accounting actions that prevented Satyam’s reported financial
results from fairly representing its financial condition.
53.
In auditing Satyam’s accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalent balances,
Respondents did not comply with PCAOB Standards by failing to exercise due professional care
and skepticism, failing to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter and substituting
management’s representations for those auditing procedures necessary to afford a reasonable basis
for an opinion regarding the financial statements. In fact, the engagement team never insisted on,
nor obtained, direct third-party confirmations for Satyam’s largest cash account, nor did it perform
sufficient audit procedures to determine whether Satyam’s accounts receivable and cash and cash
equivalent balances were not materially misstated. As a result, PW India was a cause of Satyam’s
failure to file and furnish annual and other reports to the Commission that were complete and
accurate in all material respects in violation of Section 13(a).
54.
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of registered securities
to make and keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer. Satyam violated Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by recording thousands of fictitious entries that resulted in the
false reporting of over $1 billion in non-existent revenue and cash. As described above, PW
India failed to conduct its audits in accordance with PCAOB Standards, which allowed Satyam
to utilize accounting devices that did not comply with GAAP. Had it done so, PW India would
have reasonably determined that Satyam failed to keep books and records that accurately
15


reflected transactions in violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, PW
India’s actions were a cause of Satyam’s Section 13(b)(2)(A) violations..
Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act
55.
Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act requires each audit to include procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and
material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. No showing of scienter is
necessary to establish a violation of Section 10A. SEC v. Solucorp Industries, Ltd., 197 F. Supp.
2d 4 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).
56.
PW India violated Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act by failing to conduct
procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a
direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts, particularly after
PW India: (1) failed to conduct the appropriate inquiry after receiving fixed deposit
confirmations, in the requested format, directly from branches of certain banks that purportedly
held Satyam’s largest interest bearing fixed deposit balances that were potentially conflicting
with confirmations it received from Satyam management that did not conform to the format
requested by the engagement team, a situation that should have alerted PW India to a heightened
risk that Satyam’s reported deposit balances were materially overstated; and (2) discovered
“significant deficiencies” in Satyam’s internal controls that should have caused PW India to take
additional procedures to address the heightened risk of material misstatement of Satyam’s
receivable balance during the 2007 fiscal year audit.
Rule 102(e) and Section 4C of the Exchange Act
57.
Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Section 4C of the
Exchange Act authorize the Commission to censure or deny, temporarily or permanently, the
privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission to accountants who are found to have
engaged in improper professional conduct. Under Rule 102(e)(1)(iv), the term “improper
professional conduct” means, in part, “repeated instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting
in a violation of applicable professional standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice
before the Commission.”
58.
PW India caused Satyam to file and furnish materially inaccurate audit reports by
representing that the audits were conducted in accordance with PCAOB Standards. Based on their
violations of applicable professional standards, PW India was a cause of Satyam issuing materially
false financial statements. This conduct supports an action against PW India under Rules
102(e)(1)(ii) and 102(e)(1)(iv)(B)(2) of the Rules of Practice.
F.

FINDINGS

59.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that PW India engaged in improper
professional conduct in connection with the 2005-2008 Satyam audits pursuant to Rule
16


102(e)(1)(ii) and 102(e)(1)(iv)(B)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Section 4C of the
Exchange Act. Additionally, the Commission finds that PW India violated Section 10A(a) of the
Exchange Act and was a cause of Satyam’s violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the
Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-16, and 12b-20 thereunder.
G.

REMEDIAL ACTIONS

60.
After January 2009, but before entry of this Order, PW India has taken a series of
remedial steps intended to enhance its audit quality controls in such areas as third-party
confirmations, engagement training and staffing, engagement review, and risk management. PW
India has also engaged senior audit professionals from PwC Network Firms outside India to
review completed and ongoing audit engagements to evaluate and assess PW India’s existing
audit quality and to identify U.S.-related audit practice areas in need of improvement to be
addressed by the undertakings set forth in this Order.
61.
In addition, PW India suspended its Satyam audit engagement partners from all
work and removed from client service all senior audit professionals (i.e., managers and above)
on the former Satyam audit team. After January 2009, but before the entry of this Order, PW
India replaced virtually all senior management responsible for audit matters (“Assurance
Leadership Team”). During this period, PW India also seconded several partners and other
senior audit professionals from PwC Network Firms outside of India to add full-time audit
infrastructure leadership and support throughout India.
H.

UNDERTAKINGS13
PW India undertakes the following:

1. Acceptance of New SEC Issuer Audits. From the date of this Order, PW India shall not
accept any new SEC Issuer Audits prior to the Interim Certificate of Compliance Date (defined at
Paragraph 11). The term “SEC Issuer Audit(s)” is defined to mean an engagement to audit the
consolidated financial statements filed with the Commission of an “Issuer” as that term is defined
in Section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Following the later of March 31, 2012 or
the Interim Certificate of Compliance Date, PW India shall conduct any new SEC Issuer Audit
pursuant to the Interim Conditions set forth in Paragraph 3 until the Final Certificate of
Compliance Date (defined at Paragraph 12). Until the Final Certificate of Compliance Date, PW
India agrees that the Lead Engagement Partner (“Lead Partner”) on any SEC Issuer Audit must be
deemed not unacceptable to the Independent Monitor (defined at Paragraph 10) before PW India
commences work on any SEC Issuer Audit.

13

In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission further considered PW India’s representations that: (1) it had
not accepted any new SEC Issuer Audits or SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work since January 2009; and (2) it
would voluntarily extend all relevant undertakings set forth in Section III.H to the five other India-based PwC
Network Firms.

17


2. Acceptance of SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work. PW India shall not accept SEC
Issuer Referred Engagement Work for a new client for a period of six months following the date of
this Order. The term “SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work” is defined to mean instances in
which PW India: (a) conducts a full scope audit and provides, or should provide, consistent with
Applicable Professional Standards (defined at Paragraph 3.a.), an interoffice opinion for an SEC
Issuer-affiliated entity in connection with the audit of the SEC Issuer’s consolidated financial
statements filed with the Commission; or (b) provides audit work for an SEC Issuer-affiliated
entity in connection with the audit of the SEC Issuer’s consolidated financial statements filed
with the Commission that constitutes ten percent or more of the SEC Issuer’s consolidated
assets, revenues, or expenses, as measured by the SEC Issuer’s most recent fiscal year financial
statements filed with the Commission. The term SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work
excludes Indian statutory audits for SEC Issuer-affiliated clients, SAS 70 reports (or, after June 15,
2011, SSAE No. 16 reports), and Shared Service Center Engagements (as defined in Paragraph
14). The term “new client” shall mean an SEC Issuer or a component of an SEC Issuer where PW
India: (i) has not provided any audit or review services to the SEC Issuer or any of its components
after January 1, 2010 through the date of this Order; and (ii) seeks to provide audit or review
services to the SEC Issuer or any of its components after the date of this Order. After a period of
six months following the date of this Order and until the Final Certificate of Compliance Date, PW
India shall conduct SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work for new clients pursuant to the Interim
Conditions set forth in Paragraph 3.
3. Interim Conditions. From April 1, 2011 until the Final Certificate of Compliance Date, PW
India shall conduct SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work for current clients pursuant to the
conditions set forth below (“Interim Conditions”). Upon expiration of the relevant restricted
periods specified in Paragraphs 1 and 2 above and until the Final Certificate of Compliance Date,
PW India agrees that any new SEC Issuer Audit and any SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work
for a new client shall be subject to the following Interim Conditions:
a.	 Staffing and Selection of Lead Partners, Engagement Managers, and Quality Review
Partners. PW India’s Assurance Leadership Team (“ALT”), a group which shall
include, among others, PW India’s Assurance Leader and Risk & Quality Leader, shall
select, as part of meeting their quality control requirements, the Lead Partner,
Engagement Manager, and Quality Review Partner (“QRP”), if required, for each SEC
Issuer Audit and SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work after taking into account his
or her respective performance on SEC Issuer Audits, SEC Issuer Referred Engagement
Work, and SEC Issuer-related client engagements that do not meet the thresholds
described in Paragraph 2 (collectively “SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements”) as
indicated by the results of the Real Time Review and Engagement Compliance Review
(“ECR”) programs (Paragraph 9 and 10) and the real time review program undertaken
by PW India during 2010. PW India undertakes to engage the engagement partner
from the PwC Network Firm which is the lead auditor of the relevant SEC Issuer client
(“Global Engagement Partner”) to review the selection of any Lead Partner,
Engagement Manager, and QRP before the commencement of any SEC Issuer Referred
Engagement Work. PW India shall provide the Global Engagement Partner with a
18

summary of the results of the engagement quality review conducted in October 2010,
any ECR conducted subsequent to the date of this Order, and any real time review
conducted during 2010 for each engagement on which the partner or manager served as
Lead Partner or Engagement Manager and shall provide the Global Engagement
Partner with access to any other relevant information upon request. PW India agrees
that, in the event the Global Engagement Partner informs PW India that he or she
objects to the selection of the Lead Partner, Engagement Manager or QRP to perform
such work, PW India will select an alternative candidate that meets the conditions
described in this Paragraph.
A QRP shall be assigned for all SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work that meets the
10 percent of assets, revenues, or expenses threshold in Paragraph 2. For SEC Issuer
Referred Engagement Work that does not meet the 10 percent of assets, revenues, or
expenses threshold, a QRP will be assigned, if requested by the Global Engagement
Partner. The scope of the QRP’s role on such work shall be consistent with PCAOB
Auditing Standard No. 7, Engagement Quality Review.
Any PW India partner or manager who served as the Lead Partner or Engagement
Manager on any engagement that received an overall finding of unsatisfactory due to
departures from Applicable Professional Standards14 in connection with the
engagement quality review conducted in October 2010 or any ECR performed
subsequent to the date of this Order shall not be permitted to perform any SEC Issuer
Audit or SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work as a Lead Partner or Engagement
Manager for a period of two fiscal years following the date of an overall finding of
“unsatisfactory.” Provided, however, that if PW India believes that an individual
partner or manager whose engagement received an “unsatisfactory” rating should be
exempt from the two-year practice restriction, then PW India, through its Assurance
Leader, may make a written submission to the Independent Monitor explaining the
reasons therefore and the Independent Monitor shall have the authority to exempt the
individual partner or manager if he or she believes it is appropriate to do so. In no
event, however, shall a partner or manager who receives an overall rating of
“unsatisfactory” due to departures from Applicable Professional Standards in two
consecutive quality reviews be exempt from the two-year practice restriction.
If a partner has an engagement on which he or she served as Lead Partner assessed as
unsatisfactory due to departures from Applicable Professional Standards in an
engagement quality review or ECR, that partner shall not be permitted to serve as a
QRP on any SEC Issuer Audit or SEC Referred Work Engagement for a period of two
fiscal years following the date of an overall finding of “unsatisfactory.”

14

The term “Applicable Professional Standards” means “professional standards” as defined in Section 2(a)(10) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as amended.

19


PW India shall comply with the conditions described in this Paragraph on a continuing
basis until the Final Certificate of Compliance Date.
b.	 Training. In addition to the training-based undertakings set forth in Paragraph 5, PW
India agrees to require the Lead Partner, QRP, and Engagement Manager to complete at
least: (a) eight hours of ethics training on an annual basis; and (b) 40 hours of
specialized training in U.S. GAAP, PCAOB Standards,15 and International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) before initiating any SEC Issuer Audit or SEC Issuer
Referred Engagement Work and at least 16 hours of such training in each subsequent
year that such work is performed. Training programs completed after June 2010 shall
be credited towards satisfying the 40 hour specialized training requirement of this
Paragraph. The specialized training requirements of this Paragraph may also satisfy the
specialized training hours requirements of Paragraph 5(d). All other PW India audit
staff on any SEC Issuer Audit or SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work shall be
subject to the training undertakings set forth in Paragraph 5.
c.	 Consultations. PW India undertakes to review all consultations with PW India’s
National Office concerning Applicable Professional Standards required by PW India’s
consultation policy (“Required Consultations”) involving any SEC Issuer Referred
Engagement Work with the Global Engagement Partner.
Before accepting any SEC Issuer Audit, PW India undertakes to develop a process for
review of all Required Consultations by an auditor from a PwC Network Firm outside
of India. Such process must be reviewed and deemed acceptable by the Independent
Monitor.
PW India further undertakes to resolve all Required Consultations in a manner
consistent with PW India policies and procedures prior to the issuance of any opinion,
report, or engagement completion document by PW India.
d.	 Pre-opinion Reviews. PW India undertakes, prior to the issuance of any opinion,
report, or engagement completion document by PW India, to: (i) engage the Global
Engagement Partner, or his or her partner or manager designee, to conduct a review of
any PW India SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work; and (ii) conduct a Real Time
Review (Paragraph 9) of all SEC Issuer Audits.
4. Ongoing Cooperation. PW India (including its partners, principals, officers, agents and
employees) shall cooperate fully with the Commission with respect to this action and any related

15

References in Commission rules and staff guidance and in the federal securities laws to GAAS or to specific
standards under GAAS, as they relate to issuers, should be understood to mean the standards of the PCAOB plus any
applicable rules of the Commission. See Release Nos. 33-8422; 34-49708; FR-73 at http://www.sec.gov/rules/interp
/33-8422.htm.

20


judicial or administrative proceeding or investigation commenced by the Commission or to which
the Commission is a party and subject to compliance with applicable law. PW India agrees that
such cooperation shall include, but is not limited to:
a. 	 Production of Information – at the Commission’s request, upon reasonable notice, and
without subpoena, PW India (including its partners, principals, officers, agents and
employees) shall truthfully and completely disclose all information requested by SEC
staff in connection with the Commission’s investigation, litigation or other proceedings,
except with respect to information related to clients other than Satyam, which
information shall be produced in response to subpoena or other appropriate legal
process;
b. 	 Production of Documents -- at the Commission's request, upon reasonable notice, and
without subpoena, PW India (including its partners, principals, officers, agents and
employees) shall provide any document, record, or other tangible evidence requested
by SEC staff in connection with the Commission’s investigation, litigation or other
proceedings, except with respect to documents related to clients other than Satyam,
which documents shall be provided in response to subpoena or other appropriate legal
process; and
c.	 Production of Cooperative Personnel – at the Commission's request, upon reasonable
notice, and without subpoena, PW India (including its partners, principals, officers,
agents and employees) shall use its best efforts to secure the attendance and truthful
statements or testimony of any PW India partner, principal, officer, agent, or
employee, excluding any such person who is a party to litigation with the
Commission, at any meeting, interview, testimony, deposition, trial, or other legal
proceeding.
The foregoing obligations are subject to PW India’s reservation of rights:
(i) to claim that documents or information requested is subject to attorney-client
privilege or attorney-work-product protection; and
(ii) to seek entry of a confidentiality order as to (aa) sensitive business documents or
information, (bb) sensitive personnel documents or information, or (cc)
confidential information pertaining to clients other than Satyam.
PW India further agrees that, with respect to this action and any related judicial or
administrative proceeding or investigation commenced by the Commission or to which the
Commission is a party, it will: (i) accept service by email, mail or facsimile transmission of
notices, requests, or subpoenas issued by the Commission for documents or testimony at
depositions, hearings, or trials, or in connection with any related investigation by the
Commission staff (“Commission Service”); (ii) appoint PW India’s undersigned attorney as
agent to receive Commission Service; (iii) with respect to Commission Service, waive the
21


territorial limits upon service contained in Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and
any applicable local rules, provided that the party requesting the testimony reimburses PW
India’s travel, lodging, and subsistence expenses at the then-prevailing U.S. Government per
diem rates; and (iv) consent to personal jurisdiction over PW India in any United States District
Court for purposes of enforcing any Commission Service.
5. Training and Professional Development. PW India shall evaluate its existing professional
development policy and shall make such revisions deemed necessary in order to adopt, implement,
and enforce written policies and procedures designed to provide its audit professionals with
reasonable training and education to minimize the risk of future violations of Applicable
Professional Standards and United States federal securities laws and regulations. PW India agrees
that such training and education shall include subjects relevant to the audits of SEC Issuer-Related
Audit Engagements. To that end, PW India shall require that all audit professionals complete a
training curriculum in the areas of traditional core audit and accounting, Applicable Professional
Standards, professional skepticism, behavioral change management, technical audit competence,
ethics standards, electronic and hard-copy audit documentation standards (including, as they relate
to PCAOB inspections), acceptable and appropriate third-party confirmation procedures, and other
relevant technical audit training.
a. Training Programs. Prior to March 31, 2011 and until the Final Certificate of
Compliance Date, PW India agrees and undertakes to provide annually, two-week
training programs covering the above-referenced audit topics as well as training and
presentation skills to select PW India audit professionals who thereafter will lead the
training of other PW India audit professionals. After March 31, 2011, only PW India
audit professionals who have successfully completed a two-week training program will
be permitted to lead training of other PW India audit professionals.
b. 	 Mandatory Annual Training. Prior to December 31, 2011 and until the Final Certificate
of Compliance Date, PW India agrees and undertakes to require that all audit
professionals complete an annual three-day program that includes training on the
following topics: (i) audit basics; (ii) new audit and accounting standards; (iii)
emerging issues in the profession; (iv) specific audit and accounting challenges
identified in prior years’ PW India audits; and (v) the role of the engagement quality
reviewer.
c. 	 Professional Skepticism Training. Prior to December 31, 2011, PW India agrees and
undertakes to require that all audit professionals complete an eight-hour program that
covers acceptable and appropriate professional skepticism and fraud detection. The
course will be offered annually thereafter to new hires, through the Final Certificate of
Compliance Date.
d. Specialized Training. In addition to the training and education described in Sections
5.b. and 5.c., all PW India audit professionals must complete successfully the following
core audit curriculum and specialized training before they commence audit work for
22

any SEC Issuer Audit or SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work for financial
statements after March 31, 2011:
(i) Minimum of 24 Hours of Audit-Related Training. The audit-related training
requirement shall address the following topics: (1) assessing risks of material

experienced auditor, without prior knowledge of the engagement, to be able to
reperform the work and require that any additions made after the documentation
date16 must identify the date the information was added, the name of the person who
prepared the additional documentation, and the reason for adding it. Additionally,
PW India shall adopt a policy making it mandatory that a Lead Partner on an SEC

to fraud or error) for compliance with both PCAOB Standards and related rules and
firm policies and procedures.
e. 	 Detection and Reporting of Illegal Client Activity (“Section 10A Compliance”).
Such policies and procedures shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that

procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that
would have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement

16

PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3, Paragraph 15, states, “A complete and final set of audit documentation should
be assembled for retention as of a date not more than 45 days after the report release date (documentation
completion date). If a report is not issued in connection with an engagement, then the documentation completion

reasonable assurance that the firm signing the audit report or opinion for an SEC
Issuer-Related Audit Engagement shall uniquely identify itself by, at a minimum, its
PCAOB-registered name, and the location of the registered office.

Network Firms outside India with experience in both U.S. GAAP and PCAOB
Standards to lead pre-opinion reviews of certain SEC Issuer-Related Audit
Engagements (“Real Time Reviews”). All SEC Issuer Audits and a sample of other
SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements, including at least one other SEC IssuerRelated Audit Engagement for each partner serving as Lead Partner on such an
engagement, shall be subject to a Real Time Review each year. These reviews shall be
designed to identify areas for improvement and to provide support to PW India audit
engagement teams working on SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements. SEC Issuer
Referred Engagement Work is subject to the pre-opinion reviews described in
Paragraph 3(d) and shall be excluded from the Real Time Reviews.

from PwC Network Firms outside India with experience in both U.S. GAAP and
PCAOB Standards to review selected, completed PW India SEC Issuer-Related Audit
Engagement workpapers as part of the ECR program in order to assess PW India’s
compliance with Applicable Professional Standards. The Independent Team Leader
(“ITL”) will select the engagements for review, which selection shall be part of the
ECR planning and scope subject to review and recommendation by the Independent
Monitor. As part of their engagement by PW India, these senior audit professionals
shall develop an engagement quality review program designed to measure and assess
compliance with Applicable Professional Standards and PW India partner performance
on SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements through annual post-opinion evaluations of
selected SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements. The ECR program will also identify
remedial needs on an ongoing basis. As described further in Paragraph 10, the planning
and scope of the ECR program shall incorporate recommendations made by the
Independent Monitor. The ECR program shall be overseen by an ITL experienced in
U.S GAAP and PCAOB Standards and will continue on an annual basis until the Final

applicable professional standards and PW India’s standards of quality as defined by
PCAOB Quality Control Standards17 when performing work on SEC Issuer-Related
Audit Engagements (herein referred to as “Quality Control Management Review or
“QCMR”).18 As described further in Paragraph 10, PW India’s QCMR program shall
include an annual review of completed audit work measured against a series of key
performance indicators that shall be developed, assessed, and updated on an ongoing
basis. The planning and scope of the QCMR shall be overseen by the ITL and shall

30


(iv) Remedial Measures Resulting from Annual Review Reports. To the extent that
the annual ECR and QCMR reports, or the resulting IM Report, identify deficiencies or
instances of non-compliance with respect to the standards articulated therein, PW India
shall submit to the Independent Monitor a Remedial Plan within 60 days of its receipt
of the IM Report. PW India shall permit the Independent Monitor 30 days to make

staff. All such documentation will be retained for two years following the Final
Certification of Compliance Date.
11. Interim Certificate of Compliance. Upon a finding by the Independent Monitor that PW
India: (i) has developed an acceptable process for the review of Required Consultations
(Paragraph 3.c.) for SEC Issuer Audits by an auditor experienced in U.S. GAAP and PCAOB
Standards from a PwC Network Firm outside India; (ii) has demonstrated significant progress
toward completion of the undertakings set forth in this Order; and (iii) has evidenced reasonable
assurances from the QCMRs and ECRs that there are no significant deficiencies or instances of
material non-compliance with respect to an SEC Issuer Audit or SEC Issuer Referred
Engagement Work completed and reviewed for the previous fiscal year, PW India’s Assurance
Leader shall certify in writing that it has satisfied each of the above specified conditions
(“Interim Certificate of Compliance”). The Interim Certificate of Compliance shall identify each
of the relevant reports in which PW India demonstrated written evidence of satisfaction in the
31


form of a narrative supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The Interim
Certificate of Compliance and supporting material shall be submitted to the appropriate
Commission Division of Enforcement and PCAOB Division of Enforcement designee (the
“Designees”). Upon receipt of the Interim Certificate of Compliance and any supporting
material that the ITL and Independent Monitor deem necessary to support that Certificate, the
Designees may make reasonable requests for further documents evidencing compliance and PW
India agrees to provide the requested documents to the Designees and the Independent Monitor.
Within the earlier of 30 days of receipt of the requested documents or 120 days after receipt of
the Interim Certificate of Compliance, the Independent Monitor must either affirm or withdraw
his or her initial findings regarding the Interim Certificate of Compliance in writing, a copy of
which shall be provided to PW India, the ITL, and the Designees. The Interim Certificate of
Compliance takes effect upon confirmation by both Designees that they have received the
Independent Monitor’s affirmation of findings in writing (“Interim Certificate of Compliance
Date”), but in any event the Interim Certificate of Compliance Date shall not be before March
31, 2012.
12. Final Certificate of Compliance. Upon findings by the Independent Monitor that: (i) PW
India has complied with the undertakings set forth in this Order; (ii) PW India has evidenced
reasonable assurance that its quality controls in place for SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements
are in compliance with PCAOB Quality Control Standards; and (iii) PW India has evidenced
reasonable assurances that there are no significant deficiencies or instances of material non­
compliance with respect to all of the SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements completed and
reviewed for the previous two fiscal years, PW India’s Assurance Leader shall certify in writing
that it has satisfied each of the above specified conditions (the “Final Certificate of
Compliance”). The Final Certificate of Compliance shall identify each of the relevant reports in
which the Independent Monitor has found that PW India demonstrated written evidence of
compliance in the form of a narrative supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate
compliance. The Final Certificate of Compliance and supporting material shall be submitted to
the Designees. Upon receipt of the Final Certificate of Compliance and the relevant reports, the
Designees may make reasonable requests for further documents evidencing compliance and PW
India shall provide the requested documents to the Designees and the Independent Monitor.
Within the earlier of 60 days of the Designees’ receipt of the requested documents or 120 days
after the Designees’ receipt of the Final Certificate of Compliance, the Independent Monitor
must either affirm or withdraw his or her initial findings regarding the Final Certificate of
Compliance in writing, a copy of which shall be provided to PW India, the ITL, and the
Designees. The Final Certificate of Compliance takes effect upon confirmation by both
Designees that they have received the Independent Monitor’s affirmation of findings in writing.
(“Final Certificate of Compliance Date”).
13. PCAOB Inspections. PW India shall provide to the Independent Monitor inspection
comment forms and responses and draft and final inspection reports pertaining to all PCAOB
inspections of PCAOB-registered PW India firms that may occur from the date of this Order to
the Final Certificate of Compliance Date. The goal of this undertaking is to provide the
Independent Monitor with an opportunity to review and identify any criticisms or potential
32


defects in PW India’s quality control system that would indicate PW India has failed to evidence
reasonable assurance that its quality controls in place for SEC Issuer-Related Audit Engagements
are in compliance with PCAOB Quality Control Standards. If the Independent Monitor
concludes that the results of a PCAOB inspection of a PCAOB-registered PW India firm are
inconsistent with his or her findings made in connection with Paragraph 12, the Final Certificate
of Compliance Date will not take effect until the Independent Monitor provides a written report
to PW India, the ITL, and the Designees that explains how the Independent Monitor has
reconciled any such inconsistencies to his or her satisfaction.
14. From the date of this Order and until the Final Certificate of Compliance Date, PW India
agrees and undertakes that its Shared Service Center Engagements shall be subject to the
following conditions: (a) all workpapers prepared by PW India shall be provided to the Global
Engagement Partner or his or her designee; (b) the Global Engagement Partner shall engage a
senior audit professional from a PwC Network Firm outside India to oversee and control the
execution of the Shared Service Center Engagement; and (c) the Global Engagement Partner
shall assume all responsibility for the Shared Service Center Engagement. The term “Shared
Service Center” shall mean an outsourcing facility that is a component of, or a third-party vendor
to, an SEC Issuer and which operates, controls, and processes the SEC Issuer’s group financial
transactions. The term “Shared Service Center Engagement“ shall mean an audit engagement in
which the Global Engagement Partner for an SEC-issuer group that is audited by a PwC Network
Firm instructs PW India to audit the controls and processing of group financial transactions by a
Shared Service Center. Where PW India audits a Shared Service Center’s own financial
statements and that engagement meets the definition of SEC Issuer Referred Engagement Work,
such engagement shall be subject to the limitations on acceptance of SEC Issuer Referred
Engagement Work set forth in Paragraph 2 and the Interim Conditions set forth in Paragraph 3.
In determining whether to accept the Offer, the Commission has considered these
undertakings. PW India agrees that if the Division of Enforcement believes that PW India has
not satisfied these undertakings within a reasonable time, the Division of Enforcement may
petition the Commission to reopen the matter to determine whether additional sanctions are
appropriate.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer.
Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 4C, 21B(a)(2)(B) and 21C of the Exchange Act, and
Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, it is hereby ORDERED, effective
immediately, that:
A. Respondents shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any
future violation of Section 10A(a) of the Exchange Act and from causing any
33


violation and any future violation of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange
Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-16 thereunder;
B. Respondents shall, within 45 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money
penalty in the amount of $6 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If
the payment is not made by the date the payment is required by this Order, the entire
outstanding balance of civil penalties, plus any additional interest accrued pursuant to
31 U.S.C. 3717, shall be due and payable immediately, without further application.
Payment shall be: (A) made by wire transfer, United States postal money order,
certified check, bank cashier's check or bank money order; (B) made payable to the
Securities and Exchange Commission; (C) hand-delivered or mailed to the Office of
Financial Management, Securities and Exchange Commission, Operations Center, 6432
General Green Way, Alexandria, VA 22312-0003; and (D) submitted under a
notification that identifies Lovelock & Lewes, Price Waterhouse, Bangalore, Price
Waterhouse & Co., Bangalore, Price Waterhouse Calcutta, and Price Waterhouse &
Co., Calcutta as the Respondents in these proceedings as well as the file number of
these proceedings. Respondents shall simultaneously transmit a copy of such payment
and notification to Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit,
Division of Enforcement, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549-5030.
Respondents will cooperate with the staff of the Commission to obtain evidence of
receipt of the payments set forth herein.
C. Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair Fund is created
for the penalties referenced in Paragraph B above. Regardless of whether any such
Fair Fund distribution is made, the civil penalty shall be treated as a penalty paid to the
government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent
effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that they shall not, after offset or
reduction of any award of compensatory damages in any Related Investor Action based
on Respondents’ payment of a civil penalty in this proceeding, argue that they are
entitled to, nor shall they further benefit by offset or reduction of any part of such
compensatory damages award by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a
civil penalty in this proceeding ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor
Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days
after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel
