SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Investment Advisers Act of 1940
Release No. IA-4421 / June 14, 2016
Order Approving Adjustment for Inflation of the Dollar Amount Tests in Rule
205-3 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
I.

Background
Section 205(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”)

generally prohibits an investment adviser from entering into, extending, renewing, or
performing any investment advisory contract that provides for compensation to the
adviser based on a share of capital gains on, or capital appreciation of, the funds of a
client (also known as performance compensation or performance fees). 1 Section 205(e)
authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) to exempt any
advisory contract from the performance fee prohibition if the contract is with persons
who the Commission determines do not need the protections of the prohibition, on the
basis of certain factors described in that section. 2 Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act
exempts an investment adviser from the prohibition against charging a client performance
fees in certain circumstances when the client is a “qualified client.” The rule allows an
adviser to charge performance fees if the client has at least a certain dollar amount in
assets under management (currently, $1,000,000) with the adviser immediately after
entering into the advisory contract (“assets-under-management test”) or if the adviser
reasonably believes, immediately prior to entering into the contract, that the client had a

Under section 205(e), the Commission may determine that persons do not need the
protections of section 205(a)(1) on the basis of such factors as “financial sophistication,
net worth, knowledge of and experience in financial matters, amount of assets under
management, relationship with a registered investment adviser, and such other factors as
the Commission determines are consistent with [section 205].” 15 U.S.C. 80b-5(e).

net worth of more than a certain dollar amount (currently, $2,000,000) (“net worth
test”). 3
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank
Act”) 4 amended section 205(e) of the Advisers Act to provide that, by July 21, 2011 and
every five years thereafter, the Commission shall adjust for inflation the dollar amount
thresholds included in rules issued under section 205(e), rounded to the nearest
$100,000. 5 The Commission last issued an order to revise the dollar amount thresholds
of the assets-under-management and net worth tests (to $1,000,000 and $2,000,000,
respectively, as discussed above) on July 12, 2011. 6 Rule 205-3 currently codifies the
threshold amounts revised by the 2011 Order and states that the Commission will issue an
order on or about May 1, 2016, and approximately every five years thereafter, adjusting
for inflation the dollar amount thresholds of the rule’s assets-under-management and net
worth tests based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index
(“PCE Index,” published by the United States Department of Commerce). 7

See section 418 of the Dodd-Frank Act (requiring the Commission to issue an order every
five years revising dollar amount thresholds in a rule that exempts a person or transaction
from section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act if the dollar amount threshold was a factor in
the Commission’s determination that the persons do not need the protections of that
section).

Adjustment of Dollar Amount Thresholds

On May 18, 2016, the Commission published a notice of intent to issue an order
that would adjust for inflation, as appropriate, the dollar amount thresholds of the
asset-under-management test and the net worth test. 8 The Commission stated that, based
on calculations that take into account the effects of inflation by reference to historic and
current levels of the PCE Index, the dollar amount of the assets-under-management test
would remain $1,000,000, and the dollar amount of the net worth test would increase
from $2,000,000 to $2,100,000. 9 These dollar amounts—which are rounded to the
nearest $100,000 as required by section 205(e) of the Advisers Act—would reflect
inflation from 2011 to the end of 2015.
The Commission’s notice established a deadline of June 13, 2016 for submission
of requests for a hearing. No requests for a hearing have been received by the
Commission.
III.

Effective Date of the Order
This Order is effective as of August 15, 2016. To the extent that contractual

relationships are entered into prior to the Order’s effective date, the dollar amount test
adjustments in the Order would not generally apply retroactively to such contractual
relationships, subject to the transition rules incorporated in rule 205-3. 10

See Investment Adviser Performance Compensation, Investment Advisers Act Release
No. 4388 (May 18, 2016) [81 FR 32686 (May 24, 2016)]. While the dollar amount of the
assets under-management test would not change, because the amount of the
Commission’s inflation adjustment calculation is smaller than the rounding amount
specified under rule 205-3, the dollar amount of the net worth test would be adjusted as a
result of Commission’s inflation adjustment calculation effected pursuant to the rule.

Accordingly, pursuant to section 205(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940

and section 418 of the Dodd-Frank Act,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, for purposes of rule 205-3(d)(1)(i) under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [17 CFR 275.205-3(d)(1)], a qualified client means a

contract (and any person acting on his behalf) reasonably believes, immediately prior to
entering into the contract, has a net worth (together, in the case of a natural person, with
assets held jointly with a spouse) of more than $2,100,000.

into, the adviser will be considered to satisfy the conditions of this section; Provided,
however, that if a natural person or company who was not a party to the contract becomes
a party (including an equity owner of a private investment company advised by the
adviser), the conditions of this section in effect at that time will apply with regard to that
person or company.”); see also Investment Adviser Performance Compensation,
