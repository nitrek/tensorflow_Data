In the Matter of
KARL E. HAHN

ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On September 6, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. On
September 21, 2016, the Commission issued a corrected OIP.
A prehearing conference was held on October 11, 2016, at which only the Division of
Enforcement appeared. During the conference, the Division represented that it had spoken to
Respondent and that he is aware of this proceeding but had told the Division that he does not
intend to participate for the time being because his attention is focused on a pending criminal
matter. See United States v. Hahn, No. 1:15-cr-50 (D.N.H.).1 Also, I determined based on the
declarations of service the Division has submitted that Respondent was served with the corrected
OIP in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i) by U.S. Postal Service certified mail on
September 26, 2016. His answer is therefore due October 19, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§
201.160(b), .220(b).
If Respondent fails to timely file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding, he may
be deemed in default. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f). Depending on whether
Respondent timely files an answer, I will specify in a future order due dates regarding a motion
for summary disposition by the Division, or, alternatively, a motion for default and sanctions by
the Division.

Were Respondent to appear and request a stay of this proceeding based on the pendency of his
criminal action, the Commission’s Rules of Practice would not authorize me to grant one. 17
C.F.R. § 201.210(c)(3) (authorizing stays based on related criminal investigations or
prosecutions at the request of a “criminal prosecutorial authority”).
