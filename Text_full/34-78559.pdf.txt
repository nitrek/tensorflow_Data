STEPHEN WILSHINSKY,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Section 203(f) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against Stephen J. Wilshinsky (“Respondent”
or “Wilshinsky”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission’s
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the findings contained in
paragraphs III.2 and III.4 below, and consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f)
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
1.
Between in or about April 2008 and June 2011, Wilshinsky defrauded investors in
Lenco Mobile Inc. (“Lenco”), an issuer with common stock registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of
the Exchange Act that was subject to Exchange Act reporting obligations pursuant to Section
13(a). Among other things, Wilshinsky, while a registered representative associated with two
broker-dealers registered with the Commission, received undisclosed commissions in exchange for
buying Lenco stock in his customers’ accounts. Wilshinsky, 60 years old, resides in Woodland
Hills, California.
Respondent participated in an offering of Lenco stock, which was a penny stock.
2.
On October 13, 2015, a final judgment was entered by consent against Respondent,
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act
of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder in the civil action
entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jason Cope et al., Civil Action Number 14 Civ.
7575, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
3.
The Commission’s Amended Complaint alleged that Respondent defrauded
investors by, inter alia, accepting undisclosed commissions from Izak Zirk de Maison (f/k/a Izak
Zirk Engelbrecht) (“Engelbrecht”) to buy in his customers’ accounts Lenco stock that Engelbrecht
was selling in the open market.
4.
On March 27, 2015, Respondent pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1348, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78ff, and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349 before the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Ohio, in United States v. Stephen J. Wilshinsky, Crim. Information No. 1:15-cr-75.
5.
The count of the criminal information to which Respondent pled guilty alleged,
inter alia, that Respondent conspired (i) to defraud persons in connection with the securities of an
issuer and to obtain money and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses in connection
with the purchase and sale of securities; (ii) to use manipulative and deceptive devices by making
untrue statements of material fact and omitting to state material facts necessary to make the
statements made not misleading in connection with the purchase and sale of securities; and (iii) to
devise a scheme to defraud investors by transmitting and causing the transmission by means of
wire communications in interstate commerce writings, signs, signals, and pictures.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Wilshinsky’s Offer.
