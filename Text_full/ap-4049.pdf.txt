File No. 3-17307

In the Matter of
GALILEO PETROLEUM LTD.,
HYPERION ACQUISITION CORP., and
SATORI BEVERAGES INTERNATIONAL, LTD.

ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AS
TO HYPERION ACQUISITION
CORP.

On June 21, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. On July 15, 2016, I found that Respondents Galileo Petroleum Ltd. and Satori Beverages
International, Ltd., were served with the OIP by June 28 and their answers were due by July 11,
2016; in addition, I scheduled a telephonic prehearing conference for July 22, 2016, and notified
these Respondents that if they failed to file timely answers, appear at the prehearing conference,
or otherwise defend the proceeding, I would deem them in default, determine that the allegations
in the OIP are true, and revoke the registrations of their securities. Galileo Petroleum Ltd.,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3989, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2457.
Galileo and Satori did not appear at the July 22, 2016, prehearing conference, and on that
date I issued an order requiring these two respondents to show cause by August 1, 2016, why the
registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to file timely
answers, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend this proceeding. Galileo
Petroleum Ltd., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4015, 2016 SEC LEXIS 2536 (citing OIP at
3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f)).
The OIP alleges that Hyperion Acquisition Corp. is a forfeited Delaware corporation
located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. As part of a declaration filed on July 18, 2016, the
Division of Enforcement represented that the Office of the Secretary mailed a copy of the OIP
Priority Mail Express to Hyperion at the Vietnam address shown on its most recent filing with
the Commission and submitted a USPS tracking printout showing that delivery was attempted on
June 27, 2016, in Vietnam at the address on its most recent Commission filing. According to
the Division, Vietnam signed the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and
Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters and does not oppose service through
postal channels if the documents are forwarded via registered mail with acknowledgement of

receipt, but to date no return receipt has been obtained. The declaration cites no authority
regarding the applicability of Hague service, and it appears that the service provisions of the
Hague Convention do not become effective as to Vietnam until October 1, 2016.
https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status-table/?cid=17 (last accessed Aug. 1,
2016). Case law confirms that Vietnam was previously not a signatory to the Hague Convention.
See, e.g., TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Bitton, 278 F.R.D. 687, 691 (S.D. Fla. 2012). To rely on the
attempted mail delivery in Vietnam as establishing service, there must be evidence that “the
method of service used is not prohibited by the law of the foreign country.” 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.141(a)(2)(iv).
Given these facts, the Division established service on Hyperion through other means. On
July 28, 2016, Division counsel filed his own declaration and the declaration of a process server,
establishing that Hyperion was served with the OIP on July 26, 2016, via personal service on the
Delaware Secretary of State as allowed by Delaware law inasmuch as Hyperion had no
registered agent or officer in the state of Delaware. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 § 321(a)-(b); SEC
v. Am. Land Co., No. 87-cv-1453, 1987 WL 19930, at *4 (D.D.C. Nov. 6, 1987). Hyperion’s
answer was therefore due by August 5, 2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b).
Hyperion has not filed an answer and has not otherwise defended the proceeding.
Accordingly, I ORDER Hyperion to SHOW CAUSE by August 18, 2016, why the registration of
its securities should not be revoked by default for its failure to timely file an answer or otherwise
defend this proceeding. Failure to do so will result in the revocation of its registered securities.
17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
