SUMMARY
4.

This case involves Defendant Ruehle’s theft of approximately $1.9

10

million from over 100 defrauded investors. Ruehle’s fraud was straightforward. He

11

stole from unsophisticated investors by purportedly selling them securities he knew

12

he did not own, could not transfer, and therefore could not deliver. He later

13

fabricated documents – bogus stock certificates, a forged letter from the issuer’s chief

14

executive officer – to conceal his deception. And he pocketed investors’ money for

15

himself in order to pay, among other things, his gambling debts.

16

5.

As a result of the conduct alleged herein, Ruehle violated the antifraud

17

provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the broker-dealer

18

registration provisions of Section 15 of the Exchange Act.

19

6.

With this Complaint, the SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief against

20

Ruehle from violations of the antifraud and registration provisions of the federal

21

securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains along with prejudgment interest, and

22

civil penalties.

23
24

DEFENDANT
7.

Greg Ruehle, age 64, resides in Oceanside, California and is a former

25

consultant for ICB International, Inc. (“ICBI”). Ruehle is not registered with the SEC

26

in any capacity. Ruehle does not hold any securities licenses.

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY
8.
COMPLAINT

ICBI is a privately-held medical device company incorporated in
2

Case 3:16-cv-00366-AJB-MDD Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 3 of 11

1

California in September 2008. ICBI and its securities are not registered with the SEC

2

in any capacity. On its website, ICBI states that it has developed a proprietary

3

technology which enables noninvasive diagnoses and targeted treatment of both

4

neuro-degenerative diseases and multiple cancers. ICBI calls this technology

5

“SMART Molecules”.

6

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

7

A.

Background

8

9.

In September and December 2011, Ruehle and ICBI executed a finder’s

9

agreement and a consulting agreement. Those agreements provided that Ruehle

10

would be paid a finder’s fee for introducing accredited investors to ICBI, and

11

monthly consulting fees for working to secure new investor funding for ICBI.

12

10.

ICBI’s securities are not registered with the SEC. Ruehle’s agreement

13

with ICBI required that Ruehle identify only potential investors who were “accredited

14

investors” under the applicable securities laws, and prohibited Ruehle from engaging

15

in general solicitation.

16

11.

Separately, on March 13, 2012, ICBI and Ruehle entered into a stock

17

option agreement that granted Ruehle an option to buy 100,000 shares of ICBI’s

18

common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. On its terms, however,

19

Ruehle’s stock option was non-transferable at any time prior to his death.

20

12.

About two months later, at Ruehle’s request, ICBI entered into a limited

21

waiver of non-transferability with Ruehle. It agreed to allow Ruehle to transfer his

22

option as follows: (i) 10,000 shares to a friend of Ruehle’s specifically identified by

23

the waiver agreement; and (ii) 90,000 shares to a trust controlled by Ruehle.

24
25
26

13.

agreement, including its provision on non-transferability.
B.

27
28

There were no further amendments to Ruehle’s ICBI stock option

Ruehle Steals $1.9 Million From Investors By Claiming To Sell ICBI
Securities That He Either Did Not Own Or Could Not Transfer

14.
COMPLAINT

Finding accredited investors interested in investing in ICBI proved
3

Case 3:16-cv-00366-AJB-MDD Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 4 of 11

1

difficult for Ruehle. He ultimately found only one accredited investor for ICBI; for

2

that limited work, ICBI paid Ruehle transaction-based compensation in the form of

3

about $10,000 and 1,000 shares of ICBI common stock, in accordance with the terms

4

of his ICBI agreements.

5

15.

Rather than identifying accredited investors and collecting the finder’s

6

fees contemplated by his agreement with ICBI, from about June 2012 to at least

7

February 2015, Ruehle engaged in direct transactions with ICBI investors. In those

8

sham transactions, Ruehle purportedly sold approximately 380,000 shares of ICBI

9

securities – securities that he claimed to already own – to more than 100 investors in

10
11
12
13

California and Minnesota, many of whom were unaccredited investors.
16.

These investors collectively paid Ruehle more than $1.9 million for their

supposed ICBI securities.
17.

Ruehle, however, never delivered the ICBI securities investors had paid

14

him for. Instead, Ruehle lied when telling investors he was selling ICBI securities

15

that he owned and could transfer to them, and Ruehle engaged in a scheme to defraud

16

when he later concealed his material misrepresentations by providing investors with

17

bogus stock certificates and a fake letter from ICBI’s chief executive officer.

18
19
20
21

18.

instead kept their approximately $1.9 million for himself.
19.

Ruehle used the money investors gave him to pay his personal expenses,

which included automobile purchases and debts owed on account of his gambling.

22
23

Ruehle did not transfer the funds he received from investors to ICBI, and

1.
20.

Ruehle’s material misrepresentations

During the relevant time period, Ruehle owned only 1,000 ICBI shares

24

(that he received as transaction-based compensation), and an option to purchase

25

100,000 ICBI shares (which he never exercised).

26

21.

Ruehle knew that he had not exercised his option and did not own the

27

100,000 ICBI shares subject to that option. He therefore knew that he could not

28

transfer those 100,000 shares to potential investors.
COMPLAINT

4

Case 3:16-cv-00366-AJB-MDD Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 5 of 11

1

22.

Ruehle also knew that the terms of his stock option agreement with ICBI

2

barred him from transferring his option interest to potential ICBI investors, unless he

3

received a waiver from ICBI. Ruehle never received a waiver from ICBI that would

4

permit him to transfer his option interest to potential ICBI investors.

5
6
7

23.

From at least June 2012 to February 2015, Ruehle purportedly sold

about 380,000 shares of ICBI securities to more than 100 different investors.
24.

During the course of these sham transactions, Ruehle falsely told

8

investors that he would sell them ICBI securities that he owned, which he could

9

transfer to them upon a sale.

10

25.

In sum, Ruehle not only purported to sell the 100,000 ICBI securities

11

described in the option agreement (an option he had not exercised and could not

12

transfer in any event), but also an additional 280,000 ICBI securities he neither

13

owned nor had an option to acquire.

14

26.

Ruehle did not separately purchase ICBI securities to later deliver to

15

ICBI investors.

16

27.

And finally, ICBI did not authorize Ruehle to transfer any of its

17

securities to potential investors. Ruehle’s agreement with ICBI instead required him

18

to identify accredited investors for ICBI, potential investors who ICBI then had the

19

discretion to approve or reject for investment.

20

28.

A reasonable investor would have considered it important in making

21

their investment to know that the securities they bought from Ruehle were not in fact

22

delivered, that Ruehle had lied when claiming to own securities that he would be able

23

to transfer to them, and that Ruehle was purporting to sell them unregistered ICBI

24

securities unbeknownst to ICBI and in a manner contrary to the company’s agreement

25

with Ruehle.

26
27

29.

Ruehle knew these material representations were false when made, or

was reckless or negligent in not knowing of their falsity.

30.

Ruehle created and gave investors fake ICBI stock certificates

Ruehle also provided investors with fake stock certificates which

purportedly memorialized their investment in ICBI.
31.

Using a website service, Ruehle created fake stock certificates that

claimed to be from ICBI.
32.

Those certificates state, “ICB INTERNATIONAL, INC.” in large bold

print and further provide that:

8

This certifies that [investor name] is the owner of [number of

9

shares] fully paid and non-assessable Shares of the above

10

Corporation transferable only on the books of the Corporation by

11

the holder hereof in person or by duly authorized Attorney upon

12

surrender of this Certificate properly endorsed. In Witness

13

Whereof, the said Corporation has caused this certificate to be

14

signed by its duly authorized officers and to be sealed with the

15

Seal of the Corporation.

16
17
18
19

33.

Ruehle signed each of these bogus ICBI stock certificates and provided

them to investors.
34.

In a letter that Ruehle wrote and signed, which he provided along with

an investor’s fake stock certificate, Ruehle represented that:

20

The issuance of the enclosed certificate, [sic] serves as transfer of

21

shares from Greg Ruehle to recipient [investor name] who is the

22

name of the certificate [sic]. The ability to transfer shares [sic]

23

was authorized by the CEO of the company.

24

35.

The letters and bogus ICBI stock certificates that Ruehle provided to

25

defrauded investors were all misleading, false and/or deceptive, and made by Ruehle

26

in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme.

27
28

3.
36.
COMPLAINT

Ruehle forged a letter from ICBI’s CEO

In May 2015, Ruehle drafted a letter on ICBI letterhead that purported to
6

Case 3:16-cv-00366-AJB-MDD Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 7 of 11

1

show that certain ICBI shares had been transferred to investors. Ruehle then

2

distributed this letter to investors, which stated that:

3

This is to memorialize that [number of shares] shares have been

4

transferred to [investor name] from Greg Ruehles [sic] authorized

5

Shares and will be noted in the Corporate Minutes of ICBI.

6

37.

Although the letter purports to be signed by ICBI’s CEO, Ram Bhatt

7

(which Ruehle misspelled as “Blatt”), Ruehle either forged the CEO’s signature or

8

directed someone to forge the CEO’s signature.

9
10
11

38.

Bhatt was unaware of the existence of the form letter, he did not sign it,

and he did not authorize Ruehle to use his signature on it.
39.

The forged letters that Ruehle provided to defrauded investors were all

12

misleading, false and/or deceptive, and made by Ruehle in furtherance of a fraudulent

13

scheme.

14

C.

Ruehle’s Broker-Dealer Activities

15

40.

Ruehle solicited investors for ICBI, effected – or purported to effect –

16

transactions for the accounts of others, took possession and control of the funds that

17

he raised from investors, participated in taking investors’ orders, and issued false

18

stock certificates.

19
20
21
22

41.

On at least one occasion, Ruehle received transaction-based

compensation in the form of a finder’s fee on sales of ICBI securities.
42.

Ruehle therefore effected securities transactions and/or induced the

purchase or sale of securities.
