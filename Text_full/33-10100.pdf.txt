IAN O. MAUSNER

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
INVESTMENT ADVISER PROCEEDING
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDING
Grounds for Remedial Action
Antifraud violations
Compliance and recordkeeping violations
Registered investment adviser and its principal each violated the antifraud provisions by
cherry picking profitable transactions for favored accounts and failing to disclose uses of
soft dollars to their clients. Investment adviser also engaged in related compliance and
recordkeeping violations, which principal aided, abetted, and caused. Held, it is in the
public interest to bar principal from the securities industry, to revoke investment
adviser’s registration, to impose cease-and-desist orders, and to order adviser and
principal to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest and civil money penalties.

APPEARANCES
Richard J. Morvillo and Andrew J. Morris of Morvillo LLP for J.S. Oliver Capital
Management, L.P., and Ian O. Mausner.
David J. Van Havermaat, John B. Bulgozdy, and Ronnie B. Lasky for the Division of
Enforcement.
Appeal filed: August 22, 2014
Last brief received: December 7, 2015
Oral argument held: March 7, 2016
I.
A law judge issued an initial decision finding that, beginning in 2008, J.S. Oliver Capital
Management, L.P., a registered investment adviser, and Ian O. Mausner, its principal, violated
the antifraud provisions1 by cherry picking profitable trades for favored accounts and by failing
to disclose four distinct uses of soft dollar commissions to their clients.2 The initial decision
ordered them to disgorge $1,376,440, found that they caused $10.9 million in harm to disfavored
clients by cherry picking, and imposed, among other sanctions, $3,040,000 and $14,975,000 in
civil money penalties on Mausner and J.S. Oliver, respectively. On appeal, J.S. Oliver and
Mausner do not challenge the findings of liability in the initial decision (including related
compliance and recordkeeping violations),3 or the industry bar, investment adviser registration
revocation, cease-and-desist, and disgorgement orders it imposed.4 Instead, they request that we
order civil money penalties no greater than disgorgement. But because the penalty statute and
our precedent do not limit our penalty determinations to a single factor or require us to peg
penalties to disgorgement, we reject Respondents’ argument. Upon our de novo review of the
record, we find J.S. Oliver and Mausner liable for the violations found in the initial decision and

Respondents raised an evidentiary issue relating to liability in their petition for review,
but abandoned it in their briefing. And in their challenge to the civil penalties that the law judge
imposed, they suggest that the amount of disgorgement was overstated but do not ask us to
reduce it. We address these issues below.

3
impose the same sanctions ordered in it, except that we reduce the total civil penalties on
Mausner to $1,325,000, and on J.S. Oliver to $6,625,000, by imposing second-tier penalties and
eliminating penalties assessed for conduct occurring more than five years before this proceeding
began. We also reject Respondents’ argument that the proceeding before the law judge was
unconstitutional because she was not properly appointed; consistent with our precedent, we find
that the law judge was not an inferior officer required to be appointed directly by the
Commission. We base our findings on an independent review of the record, except with respect
to those findings not challenged on appeal.
II.
Although J.S. Oliver and Mausner do not challenge the law judge’s findings of liability,
our long-standing practice provides that the initial decision “ceased to have any force or effect”
when we granted Respondents’ petition for review.5 For this reason, we set forth below the facts
supporting our findings of liability and explain the legal basis for those conclusions.
A.

J.S. Oliver and Mausner violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws by
cherry picking profitable trades for favored accounts.

We agree with the initial decision’s conclusion that J.S. Oliver and Mausner violated the
antifraud provisions of the securities laws by cherry picking profitable trades for favored
accounts. “Cherry picking is a practice in which securities professionals allocate profitable
trades to a preferred account (like their own) and less profitable or unprofitable trades to a nonpreferred account (like a customer’s).”6 In this way, an investment adviser can increase the
performance of favored accounts, or at least make it more likely that they will outperform other
accounts.
One form of cherry picking involves an adviser’s allocation of block trades. When an
adviser executes a block trade at multiple prices, it may allocate the highest-price sales to
favored accounts and the lowest-price sales to disfavored accounts. An adviser can also cherry
pick by allocating profitable trades entirely to favored accounts.
1. Between June 2008 and November 2009, J.S. Oliver and Mausner systematically
allocated profitable trades to favored accounts on a disproportionate basis.
J.S. Oliver is a registered investment adviser that Mausner co-founded in 2004. Mausner
was J.S. Oliver’s chief executive officer, portfolio manager, and ultimate decision-maker.

‘device, scheme, or artifice to defraud’ and operated ‘as a fraud or deceit upon’ investors” under
Securities and Exchange Act antifraud provisions); id. at 1308-09 (finding that cherry picking
also violated Advisers Act antifraud provisions).

4
Mausner managed client accounts, as well as hedge funds, for J.S. Oliver. J.S. Oliver offered
those funds to its clients, and Mausner also invested in them.
In June 2008, Mausner launched a new hedge fund, J.S. Oliver Concentrated Growth
Fund (“CGF”), using Mausner’s seed money. Although J.S. Oliver’s other funds had not
performed well in 2007 and 2008, CGF did not share that track record, which made it easier for
Mausner to market CGF to investors. CGF’s fee structure also was more favorable to J.S. Oliver
than those of its other funds, and J.S. Oliver’s funds generally paid it higher fees than its separate
client accounts. Following CGF’s launch, Mausner aggressively promoted its performance in
mass email distributions to J.S. Oliver’s clients and others.
Mausner’s emails promoting CGF’s performance raised red flags for at least one J.S.
Oliver client. Although that client’s account followed a similar strategy to CGF, the
performance of the client’s account lagged the market. Because of the similarity in investment
strategy, the client’s principal did not understand how CGF could perform much better than the
client’s account. When pressed, Mausner provided the client with false explanations of the
disparity in account performance.
The client’s suspicions were well-founded. Mausner traded many of the same securities
in J.S. Oliver’s funds and individual accounts, and these accounts frequently participated in the
same block trades. J.S. Oliver’s written policies required that allocations of these trades be fair
and equitable, and they specifically required that trades placed together but made at various
prices on the same day be allocated among participating accounts on the basis of average cost.
But Mausner, who made or directed all allocations of these trades among J.S. Oliver accounts,
did not follow these policies.
Beginning in June 2008, Mausner systematically allocated the most profitable trades to
six favored accounts, including those of J.S. Oliver’s four hedge funds, at the expense of three
disfavored client accounts, including the accounts of an elderly widow’s trust and a non-profit
organization. Mausner did so using the order management system (“OMS”) that J.S. Oliver’s
prime broker offered. Although OMS allowed J.S. Oliver to allocate trades using predefined
schema (such as average cost), in many cases, Mausner made manual allocations, which are
much less common. Because OMS allowed Mausner to make allocations after the end of the
trading day, he could allocate trades after first-day returns (the difference between the transaction
and closing prices) were known. And where J.S. Oliver executed a block trade at multiple
prices, Mausner could use OMS to allocate the best priced trades to favored accounts and the
least favorably priced trades to disfavored accounts.
During the relevant period, J.S. Oliver’s prime broker created numerous cherry-picking
review reports addressing J.S. Oliver’s trade allocation. The prime broker generated these
reports to alert its clients, such as investment managers, to variances in how particular accounts
were treated with respect to allocations of trades in a specific security on a given day. In its
reports, J.S. Oliver’s prime broker identified more than 4,000 instances of potential cherry
picking during the relevant period. Even after the prime broker recommended to Respondents
that they allocate trades using average prices to avoid the disparities highlighted by the reports,
J.S. Oliver and Mausner continued to allocate trades in a way that generated the reports.

5
The Division of Enforcement proved that J.S. Oliver and Mausner had cherry picked
profitable trades for favored accounts through a statistical analysis prepared by Paul Glasserman,
a professor at Columbia Business School. Glasserman examined more than 23,000 equity
transactions in J.S. Oliver’s trade blotter between June 2008 and November 2009 and found
“extremely strong statistical evidence” that Mausner and J.S. Oliver had systematically allocated
a disproportionately large share of equity trades with positive first-day returns to the six favored
accounts and systematically allocated a disproportionately large share of equity trades with
negative first-day returns to the three disfavored accounts.
Glasserman found that the probability that the observed allocation of profitable and
unprofitable trades between the favored and disfavored accounts arose by chance was
approximately one in one quadrillion (i.e., 1 x 1015). Glasserman also found that favored
accounts realized an average first-day return of positive 0.12% (on a dollar-weighted basis)
during the relevant period, while the average first-day return for disfavored accounts was
negative 1.31%, a difference of 1.43%. On an annualized basis, these numbers were positive
35% for the favored accounts and negative 96% for the disfavored accounts, a 131% disparity.
Glasserman found that the probability that the observed difference of 1.43% in first-day returns
arose due to chance was effectively zero. He also examined various alternative explanations
offered for the bias in trade allocations and difference in first-day returns and concluded that,
even after controlling for these considerations, bias and differences in first-day returns remained
at similarly high levels of statistical significance. Glasserman also determined that the favored
and disfavored accounts that were the subject of Respondents’ cherry picking made up
approximately 98% of J.S. Oliver’s total trading volume over the relevant period. Using firstday returns, Glasserman calculated that Respondents’ biased allocation of trades caused the three
disfavored accounts to incur total losses of $10.9 million.
By cherry picking profitable trades in favor of CGF, Mausner was able to increase its
performance and attract clients based on inflated performance results. During the relevant
period, J.S. Oliver earned performance fees of $224,600 from CGF.
2. J.S. Oliver and Mausner repeatedly violated the antifraud provisions by
fraudulently allocating trades.
The Division met its burden of establishing that J.S. Oliver and Mausner violated the
antifraud provisions by cherry picking. Securities Act Section 17(a)(1) and (3)7 and Exchange
Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c)8 each prohibit, among other things, fraudulent
7

15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1) and (3) (prohibiting “employ[ing] any device, scheme, or artifice to
defraud” and “engag[ing] in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or
would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser”).

15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) (making it unlawful for any person to “use or employ. . . any
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as
the Commission may prescribe”); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a) and (c) (barring “employ[ing] any
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud” and “engag[ing] in any act, practice, or course of business
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person”).

6
conduct. Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4)9 and Rule 206(4)-810 prohibit such conduct
by investment advisers, and advisers to pooled investment vehicles, respectively. Securities Act
Section 17(a)(1), Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and Advisers Act Section 206(1) require a showing
of scienter before liability can be imposed.11 But, as relevant here, negligence is sufficient for
liability under Section 17(a)(3), Sections 206(2) and (4), and Rule 206(4)-8.12
We find that J.S. Oliver and Mausner systematically allocated trades to favored accounts
on a disproportionate basis with scienter. Scienter is “a mental state embracing intent to deceive,
manipulate, or defraud,”13 and “includes recklessness, defined as conduct that is ‘an extreme
departure from the standards of ordinary care, . . . which presents a danger of misleading buyers
or sellers that is either known to the [respondent] or is so obvious that the [respondent] must
have been aware of it.’”14 Scienter may be proven by “inference from circumstantial evidence,”

jurisdictional means “directly or indirectly—(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to
defraud any client or prospective client; (2) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of
business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client; . . . or (4) to
engage in any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative”).

which “can be more than sufficient” to establish the requisite state of mind.15 “A company’s
scienter is imputed from that of the individuals controlling it.”16
The evidence here establishes that Mausner, and thus J.S. Oliver, acted with scienter by
deliberately defrauding customers through biased trade allocations. Mausner was the only
person at J.S. Oliver who could approve trade allocations, and he either personally made or
directed each of the allocations over the relevant 18-month period. Mausner’s actions marked a
sharp departure from J.S. Oliver’s written policy of fair trade allocation. After J.S. Oliver’s
prime broker generated potential cherry picking reports listing inconsistencies in trade
allocations, Mausner disregarded its advice to allocate trades based on average price. Instead of
selecting a pre-defined schema to allocate trades fairly, Mausner made and approved allocations
that systematically favored certain accounts, including those of the four affiliated J.S. Oliver
funds. These funds paid J.S. Oliver more in fees than individual accounts generally did. The
start of Mausner’s cherry picking also coincided with his launch of a new fund (CGF), which
Mausner initially funded. Mausner promoted CGF heavily to prospective investors based on the
inflated performance he obtained by cherry picking, and over the relevant period, J.S. Oliver
received $224,600 in performance fees from CGF. When one client asked Mausner why the
client’s account had not performed as well as CGF, although the two accounts followed similar
strategies, Mausner lied about the reason for the disparity in performance. We conclude that J.S.
Oliver and Mausner acted with scienter.17
J.S. Oliver and Mausner’s conduct also satisfies the additional statutory requirements for
liability under the antifraud provisions at issue. They acted through means of interstate
commerce as required by all provisions,18 and their misconduct, which related to the allocation of
both purchases and sales, was necessarily “in the offer or sale” and “in connection with the
purchase or sale,” of securities, as required under Securities Act Section 17(a),19 and Exchange

Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, respectively.20 J.S. Oliver and Mausner are both investment
advisers as required for liability under Section 206 because they provided investment advice to
others for profit,21 and their misconduct was with respect to “any client or prospective client.”22
And because they made investment decisions on behalf of their hedge funds (all pooled
investment vehicles), they were investment advisers to a pooled investment vehicle, as required
for liability under Rule 206(4)-8(a).23
Although they do not now contest liability, J.S. Oliver and Mausner asserted in their
petition for review that the law judge erred because she did not admit a document providing
account returns that purportedly would have helped show they did not cherry pick. But the
exclusion of that exhibit is irrelevant because Respondents abandoned their argument in their
briefing on the merits—thus depriving the Division of the opportunity to respond—and they now
challenge only the civil money penalties that the law judge imposed. In any event, the document
that Respondents referenced in their petition does not show any flaw in Glasserman’s analysis
because it does not address the first-day results that he analyzed. It shows the performance of
only certain accounts over longer time periods, including after the close of the relevant period.
For these reasons, we conclude that J.S. Oliver and Mausner repeatedly violated the
antifraud provisions by cherry picking profitable transactions for favored accounts. Each time
that they did so, they violated the securities laws. In particular, they repeatedly employed a
deceptive device, scheme, or artifice to defraud and engaged in deceptive acts and practices
prohibited by the antifraud provisions.24

See supra notes 7-10 (excerpting language of relevant antifraud provisions). The law
judge also found that Respondents violated the antifraud provisions by failing to disclose their
cherry picking, and Respondents do not challenge this finding. Because we sanction
Respondents for their acts of cherry picking, rather than their failure to disclose it, we do not
discuss this finding herein.

B.

J.S. Oliver and Mausner violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws by
failing to disclose their uses of soft dollars to their clients.

We also agree with the law judge that J.S. Oliver and Mausner violated the antifraud
provisions of the securities laws by failing to disclose four separate uses of over $1.1 million in
soft dollars to their clients.
1. Between January 2009 and November 2011, J.S. Oliver and Mausner caused soft
dollars (client assets) to be used to pay expenses that benefited them without
disclosing these uses to their clients.
Between January 2009 and November 2011, J.S. Oliver and Mausner caused over $1.1
million in soft dollars to be used to pay expenses that benefited them without disclosing these
uses to their clients. Soft dollars are client assets. “Soft dollar practices are arrangements under
which products or services other than execution of securities transactions . . . are obtained by an
adviser from or through a broker in exchange for the direction by the adviser of client brokerage
transactions to the broker.”25 A limited safe harbor created by Exchange Act Section 28(e)
applies to certain payments of research and brokerage expenses.26
In early 2009, J.S. Oliver established relationships with broker-dealers that permitted the
use of soft dollars for purposes beyond the Section 28(e) safe harbor. J.S. Oliver and these
brokers agreed on commission rates for the execution of trades, and these agreed commission
rates included a soft dollar component that benefited J.S. Oliver. The brokers accrued soft
dollars for J.S. Oliver’s account that were generated from trades placed by J.S. Oliver for its
funds and client accounts. J.S. Oliver would then submit invoices to the brokers, which Mausner
approved, requesting that certain payments be made from its soft dollar accounts. Because these
payments came from client assets, amassed through higher brokerage commissions charged to
J.S. Oliver’s funds and separately managed clients than otherwise would be payable, J.S. Oliver
did not have to make the payments itself out of its own resources. As a result, the soft dollar
payments gave J.S. Oliver a motive to make more trades than necessary in order to accrue
additional soft dollars in its account.
J.S. Oliver purported to describe its uses of soft dollars in Part 2 of its Form ADV, which
was distributed to all clients, and in offering memoranda distributed to investors in the four funds
that it managed. These disclosures stated that J.S. Oliver might use soft dollars for research and
brokerage services within the scope of Section 28(e), as well as for other purposes outside the
safe harbor that they purported to describe in varying terms. But these documents did not

10
disclose four ways in which J.S. Oliver was using soft dollars, including three that benefited
Mausner personally, and none of those four uses fell within Section 28(e).
First, J.S. Oliver and Mausner used soft dollars to pay $482,381 to Powerhouse Capital,
an ostensible research firm owned by a former J.S. Oliver employee, for what amounted to that
employee’s salary and a bonus for operating the soft dollar program. But J.S. Oliver did not
disclose in its Form ADV or the offering memoranda for three of its four funds that it would pay
salaries using soft dollars. And although the CGF offering memorandum identified salaries as a
potential use of soft dollars, it did not identify bonus payments or explain that J.S. Oliver would
use soft dollars to pay a former employee for management of its soft dollar program. In any
event, J.S. Oliver did not provide the CGF offering memorandum, which applied to the investors
in CGF, to all of its clients.
Second, J.S. Oliver and Mausner used soft dollars to pay $329,365 to Mausner’s former
spouse in connection with a marital settlement agreement with Mausner. Neither J.S. Oliver’s
Form ADV nor any of its offering memoranda disclosed that J.S. Oliver would use soft dollars to
satisfy Mausner’s personal obligation to his ex-wife. And to secure the payment, Mausner
directed a subordinate to fabricate an excerpt from a non-existent contract between J.S. Oliver
and Mausner’s former spouse and to provide the false document to J.S. Oliver’s broker.
Third, J.S. Oliver and Mausner caused $300,000 in soft dollars to be used to pay rent to
J.O. Samantha, a company that Mausner owned. J.O. Samantha owned the house that J.S. Oliver
used for its offices and that Mausner sometimes used as his personal residence. After Mausner
arranged for rent to be paid using soft dollars, he twice raised the rent for the property (including
retroactively) to above-market rates, and he directed that the difference between the monthly rent
payment and J.O. Samantha’s monthly mortgage obligation be deposited in his personal account.
Respondents did not disclose these uses of soft dollars in J.S. Oliver’s Form ADV or offering
memoranda. The Form ADV and offering memoranda for three funds mentioned that soft
dollars might be used for overhead (although they did not identify rent among the examples of
possible overhead expenses), and the CGF offering memorandum more specifically identified
rent as an expense that might be paid with soft dollars. But J.S. Oliver nowhere disclosed that it
would use soft dollars to pay rent to an entity that Mausner owned and controlled, that he could
set the rent unilaterally, or that he would transfer large sums to his personal account from those
payments.
Fourth, J.S. Oliver and Mausner used soft dollars to pay $40,000 to the St. Regis
Residence Club in New York City for a timeshare Mausner maintained there. Mausner used the
timeshare, among other things, to visit his family and entertain guests. J.S. Oliver and Mausner
never disclosed that they would use soft dollars to pay Mausner’s timeshare bills. Some
disclosures mentioned that J.S. Oliver would use soft dollars to reimburse travel expenses related
to conferences, and the CGF offering memorandum disclosed that soft dollars might be used for
travel and other expenses related to potential investment opportunities. But Mausner used the
timeshare for personal uses, and the record does not show that Mausner otherwise used the
timeshare consistent with J.S. Oliver’s disclosures.

2. Respondents violated the antifraud provisions by failing to disclose their soft
dollar uses to their clients.
We find that J.S. Oliver and Mausner violated the antifraud provisions by failing to
disclose their uses of soft dollars to their clients. Securities Act Sections 17(a)(1) and (3), as
well as Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a) and (c), prohibit certain material misrepresentations and
omissions.27 In addition, Securities Act Section 17(a)(2),28 Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(b),29 and
Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-8(a)(1)30 each prohibit specified misrepresentations and omissions.
Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) also prohibit fraudulent misstatements and omissions
by investment advisers.31

and Rule 10b–5 are “mutually supporting rather than mutually exclusive.” Cady, Roberts & Co.,

12
J.S. Oliver and Mausner were under a duty to disclose their uses of soft dollars for two
reasons. First, as investment advisers, they were charged with the affirmative duty of “utmost
good faith, and full and fair disclosure of all material facts” and the obligation “to employ
reasonable care to avoid misleading” their clients through half-truths or incompletely
volunteered information.32 Respondents were under a “duty to disclose any potential conflicts of
interest accurately and completely.”33 “It is indisputable that potential conflicts of interest are
‘material’ facts with respect to clients and the Commission.”34 Soft dollars payments present
such a conflict because they are obtained from client funds but used to benefit an investment
adviser.
Second, because J.S. Oliver and Mausner purported to describe their uses of soft dollars
in Part 2 of their Form ADV, they were required to disclose facts necessary to ensure that these
statements were not misleading.35 And they were under a duty to update their statements to
ensure that they were accurate.36 For example, Advisers Act Section 204 and Rule 204-1(a)(2)
require an investment adviser to amend its Form ADV if required by the form’s instructions.37
Those instructions require prompt updates if information provided in Part 2 of Form ADV,
where J.S. Oliver described its soft dollar uses, “becomes materially inaccurate.”38

13
J.S. Oliver and Mausner acted with scienter by omitting to disclose four distinct ways
they used over $1.1 million of soft dollars (client assets) for their own benefit.39 Three of these
uses provided Mausner with direct personal benefits. Mausner approved the requests for soft
dollar payments, and he directed the creation of a false document to ensure that a settlement
payment was made to his ex-wife. The record amply establishes that Mausner, and thus J.S.
Oliver, acted with scienter in failing to disclose the four soft dollar uses at issue.
Because each of J.S. Oliver’s and Mausner’s failures to disclose their uses of soft dollars
constitutes a separate omission of a material fact, we find that they violated the antifraud
provisions on at least four occasions. Their misconduct occurred in interstate commerce, was in
the offer or sale, and purchase and sale, of securities, and they obtained money by means of their
failure to disclose their soft dollar uses.
J.S. Oliver and Mausner also each violated Advisers Act Section 207 through their
misrepresentations and omissions in J.S. Oliver’s Form ADV. Section 207 makes it unlawful for
“any person willfully to make any untrue statement of a material fact” in Form ADV or
“willfully to omit to state . . . any material fact which is required to be stated therein.”40 Scienter
is not required for violations of Section 207.41 To find willfulness, it is sufficient that the
respondent “intentionally commit[ed] the act which constitutes the violation.”42 There is no
requirement that the respondent “also be aware” that he “violat[ed] one of the Rules or Acts.”43
J.S. Oliver’s and Mausner’s conduct meets this standard.
In addition, J.S. Oliver violated Advisers Act Section 204 and Rule 204-1(a)(2) by failing
to update its Form ADV to disclose its soft dollar uses.44 Mausner aided and abetted, and thus

39

A showing of scienter is necessary to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b),
Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, Securities Act Section 17(a)(1), and Advisers Act Section 206(1),
while negligence is sufficient under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) and Sections 206(2) and (4). See
supra notes 11 and 12.

also caused,45 this violation because he substantially assisted J.S. Oliver’s misconduct and acted
with scienter.46
C.

J.S. Oliver also violated compliance and recordkeeping requirements, and Mausner
aided, abetted, and caused these violations.

We also agree with the law judge that J.S. Oliver violated compliance and recordkeeping
requirements. Mausner aided, abetted, and caused these violations.
First, J.S. Oliver willfully violated compliance requirements imposed by Advisers Act
Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-7.47 Rule 206(4)-7 provides that it shall be unlawful under
Section 206(4) for a registered investment adviser, or an adviser required to be registered under
Section 203, to provide investment advice to clients unless it adopts and implements written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the Advisers Act and rules
by the adviser and its supervised persons. But by cherry picking J.S. Oliver ignored and failed to
implement its written trade allocation policy. Mausner aided, abetted, and caused J.S. Oliver’s
violation because he intentionally allocated trades in violation of J.S. Oliver’s written policies.48
Second, J.S. Oliver willfully violated recordkeeping requirements. Advisers Act Section
204(a) generally provides that investment advisers “shall make and keep for prescribed periods
such records . . . , furnish such copies thereof, and make and disseminate such reports as the
Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the

protection of investors.”49 In turn, Advisers Act Rule 204-2(a) requires every registered
investment adviser or adviser required to be registered under Advisers Act Section 203 to “make
and keep true, accurate and current” specified books and records relating to its investment
advisory business, including, among other things, a “memorandum of each order given by the
investment adviser for the purchase or sale of any security” and copies of all written
communications the investment adviser sends relating to “any recommendation made or
proposed to be made and any advice given or proposed to be given.”50
J.S. Oliver willfully violated these provisions because it failed to maintain trade blotters
memorializing each order it gave for the purchase or sale of securities over at least a six-month
period and failed to maintain copies showing recipients’ addresses of emails promoting CGF’s
performance and recommending that current and prospective investors invest in it. Mausner
aided, abetted, and caused these violations. He recklessly failed to comply with J.S. Oliver’s
document retention obligations.
III.
The law judge barred Mausner from association with an investment adviser, broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized
statistical rating organization (an “industry bar”); revoked J.S Oliver’s registration as an
investment adviser; entered cease-and-desist orders against each of them; ordered them jointly
and severally to disgorge $1,376,440, plus prejudgment interest; and imposed civil money
penalties of $3,040,000 on Mausner and $14,975,000 on J.S Oliver. Respondents challenge only
the civil money penalties. We generally impose the same sanctions as those imposed in the
initial decision except that we reduce the civil penalties on J.S. Oliver and Mausner to
$1,325,000 and $6,625,000, respectively; unlike the initial decision, we impose second-tier
penalties in our discretion based on the facts and circumstances present here and do not impose
penalties for conduct that occurred more than five years before the order instituting proceedings
was issued.
A.

We bar Mausner from the securities industry.

We bar Mausner from the securities industry for his misconduct between 2008 and 2011.
Advisers Act Section 203(f) authorizes us to impose an industry bar on any person who, at the
time of the misconduct, was associated with an investment adviser if we find that the person
willfully violated or “aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured” a violation of

49

15 U.S.C. § 80b-4(a) (making requirement applicable to “[e]very investment adviser who
makes use of the mails or of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection
with his or its business as an investment adviser” other than advisers “specifically exempted
from registration” pursuant to Advisers Act Section 203(b)).
50

17 C.F.R. § 275.204-2(a)(3) and (7).

16
the securities laws and the bar is in the public interest.51 At the time of his misconduct, Mausner
was associated with J.S. Oliver, an investment adviser, and he acted willfully.52
We find that it would serve the public interest to bar Mausner from the securities
industry. In making that determination, we consider, among other things, “the egregiousness of a
respondent’s actions, the degree of scienter involved, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the recognition of the wrongful nature of the conduct, the sincerity of any assurances
against future violations, and the likelihood that the respondent’s occupation will present
opportunities for future violations.”53 Our inquiry into the public interest “is flexible, and no
single factor is dispositive.”54
Mausner’s conduct was egregious and he acted with a high degree of scienter. Although
he was an investment adviser charged with fiduciary duties to his clients,55 Mausner persistently
and systematically failed to act in the best interests of those clients (including at least one elderly
client and a non-profit) by disproportionately allocating profitable trades to favored accounts and
using soft dollars to pay for undisclosed personal benefits, effectively stealing from clients.
Indeed, Mausner caused at least some of the soft dollar commissions to be transferred to his
personal account. Mausner also directed that a subordinate prepare and submit a fraudulent
document to a soft dollar broker so that the broker would make a settlement payment to his
former spouse. And when one client became suspicious, Mausner lied to its principal about the
reasons for the disparity in performance between its account and CGF. Mausner’s conduct was
also recurrent: Mausner continued his cherry-picking scheme, in which he made or directed each
of the many fraudulent allocations, for 18 months, and he directed the submission of the soft
dollar invoices at issue from 2009 to 2011. Although Mausner does not now contest liability, he
argued in the proceedings before the law judge that the Division had not established his liability.
On appeal, he argues only that the penalties imposed on him are excessive; he does not address
the wrongful nature of the conduct. And he has not provided any assurances against future
violations. The securities industry presents many opportunities for future violations and
Mausner’s continued employment in it in any capacity would pose an unacceptable risk to
investors.56 We find that an industry bar will protect investors from future violations by Mausner
51

15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(f) (referencing, among other provisions, Advisers Act Section
203(e)(5), (6), 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(e)(5), (6)).

and that his ongoing failure to disclose the use of soft dollars after the effective date of the DoddFrank Act independently supports all components of an industry bar.
B.

We revoke J.S. Oliver’s investment adviser registration.

We also revoke J.S. Oliver’s investment adviser registration. Advisers Act Section
203(e) authorizes us to revoke an adviser’s registration if it is in the public interest and the
adviser, or any person associated with it, has willfully violated the securities laws.57 J.S. Oliver
has done so by cherry picking, failing to disclose its soft dollar uses, and engaging in other
violations. Revocation is in the public interest for the same reasons that we impose an industry
bar on Mausner because Mausner controlled J.S. Oliver and acted through it.
C.

We impose cease-and-desist orders on J.S. Oliver and Mausner.

We also find it appropriate to impose cease-and-desist orders on J.S. Oliver and Mausner.
Advisers Act Section 203(k)(1) authorizes us to impose a cease-and-desist order on any person
we find has violated or a caused a violation of the Advisers Act or rules thereunder,58 and, in this
case, Securities Act Section 8A59 and Exchange Act Section 21C60 provide for the same relief for
violations of those statutes. In determining whether a cease-and-desist order is appropriate, we
consider, among other things, the same factors used in determining whether a bar is in the public
interest. We also take into account “whether the violation is recent, the degree of harm to
investors or the marketplace resulting from the violation, and the remedial function to be served
by the cease-and-desist order in the context of any other sanctions being sought in the same
proceedings,”61 as well as the risk of future violations.62 Although “‘some’ risk is necessary, it
need not be very great to warrant issuing a cease-and-desist order.”63 “Absent evidence to the
contrary, a finding of violation raises a sufficient risk of future violation.”64
We order J.S. Oliver and Mausner to cease and desist from committing or causing
violations or future violations of the securities law provisions they violated or caused to be
violated: Securities Act Section 17(a); Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5; and
Advisers Act Sections 204, 206(1), (2), and (4), and 207 and Rules 204-1(a)(2), 204-2(a)(3) and

(7), 206(4)-7, and 206(4)-8. The same factors that strongly support the industry bar and
revocation orders that we impose also support cease-and-desist orders. J.S. Oliver and Mausner
violated the antifraud provisions as recently as 2011, and they caused more than $10 million in
harm to investors. The cease-and-desist orders are a crucial complement to the industry bar
because the securities laws “apply to securities transactions by any person.”65 And although we
revoke J.S. Oliver’s registration as an investment adviser, Section 206 prohibits fraud by all
advisers, not just those registered with the Commission.66 Cease-and-desist orders are “therefore
necessary to protect the public against future violations that [respondents] could commit without
being . . . associated person[s] of a broker-dealer,”67 or other entity covered by an industry bar.
Finally, we find that J.S. Oliver and Mausner’s recurrent misconduct establishes the risk of
future violations necessary to impose cease-and-desist orders.68
D.

We order J.S. Oliver and Mausner to jointly and severally disgorge their ill-gotten
gains and to pay pre-judgment interest.

We also find it appropriate to order J.S. Oliver and Mausner, jointly and severally, to
disgorge $1,376,440, plus prejudgment interest. In this proceeding, Securities Act Section
8A(e), Exchange Act Section 21C(e), Advisers Act Sections 203(j) and (k)(5), and Investment
Company Act Section 9(e) all authorize us to impose disgorgement and reasonable interest.69
Disgorgement “is intended primarily to prevent unjust enrichment.”70 Although “the amount of
disgorgement should include all gains flowing from the illegal activities,” calculating that
amount “requires only a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the
violation.”71 “Once the Division shows that its disgorgement figure” reasonably approximates

the ill-gotten gains, “the burden shifts to the respondent to demonstrate that the Division’s
estimate is not a reasonable approximation.”72 Thus, “[e]xactitude is not a requirement; ‘[s]o
long as the measure of disgorgement is reasonable, any risk of uncertainty should fall on the
wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created that uncertainty.’”73
The Division’s calculation of $1,376,440 in disgorgement represents a reasonable
approximation of J.S. Oliver and Mausner’s ill-gotten gains. This is the sum of all the soft dollar
payments at issue that Respondents did not disclose to their clients ($1,151,840), plus
performance fees earned from CGF ($224,600) during the relevant period. Respondents
benefited from the undisclosed payments and obtained performance fees based on returns that
they inflated by cherry picking and used to attract investors. These gains flowed from their
misconduct.
Although J.S. Oliver and Mausner do not directly challenge the law judge’s imposition of
disgorgement, they suggest in their argument regarding civil money penalties that the
disgorgement that the law judge ordered overstates their ill-gotten gains from soft dollars. They
do not dispute that Mausner benefited directly from the payment to his former spouse, excess
rent that he deposited in his bank account, and timeshare payments. Instead, Respondents assert
that $482,381 in soft dollars went to compensate one of Mausner’s subordinates and “some of
the payments at issue, such as a portion of the rent, were earned.” We are not convinced. J.S.
Oliver and Mausner benefited from the payments to Mausner’s subordinate and any allegedly
legitimate portion of the rent and timeshare payments because J.S. Oliver and Mausner arranged
for these payments to be made from client funds using soft dollars, instead of their own
resources. We order Respondents to pay $1,376,440 in disgorgement jointly and severally,74
plus prejudgment interest.75

We impose modified civil money penalties on Respondents for their acts and
omissions violating the antifraud provisions.

We also impose $1,325,000 in civil money penalties on Mausner and $6,625,000 on J.S.
Oliver for their recurrent cherry picking and multiple failures to disclose their soft dollar uses.
1.

The relevant statute and law afford us discretion in determining whether to
assess civil money penalties, and if so, in setting their amount.

It is a “long-standing principle”76 that “the breadth of agency discretion is, if anything, at
[its] zenith when the action assailed relates primarily not to the issue of ascertaining whether
conduct violates the statute, or regulations, but rather to the fashioning of policies, remedies, and
sanctions . . . to arrive at maximum effectuation of Congressional objectives.”77 We have
consistently held that “the appropriateness of the sanctions imposed depends on the facts and
circumstances of the particular case and cannot be determined precisely by comparison with
action taken in other cases,”78 and the D.C. Circuit has recognized that we are “not obligated to
make [our] sanctions uniform.”79 “The employment of a sanction within the authority of an
administrative agency is thus not rendered invalid in a particular case because it is more severe
than sanctions imposed in other cases.”80
Consistent with these principles, Congress granted us considerable discretion under
Advisers Act Section 203(i) to decide in eligible cases whether to assess civil money penalties,
and if so, to determine the appropriate amount of those penalties.81 If statutory prerequisites are
met, Section 203(i) provides that we “may impose a civil penalty”82 of up to an applicable

statutory maximum for “each” eligible “act or omission”83 if we find that the “penalty is in the
public interest.”84 This inquiry necessarily invokes our discretion.85
To guide our discretion, Congress provided a broad, non-exclusive list of factors that we
“may consider” in determining the public interest.86 These factors include: (A) “whether the act
or omission for which such penalty is assessed involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate
or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement”; (B) “the harm to other persons resulting either
directly or indirectly from such act or omission”; (C) “the extent to which any person was
unjustly enriched, taking into account any restitution made to persons injured by such behavior”;
(D) specified prior findings of misconduct; and (E) “the need to deter such person and other
persons from committing such acts or omissions.”87 Congress also specified that we may
consider “such other matters as justice may require.”88
In this context, the overall penalties that we impose depend on three determinations: the
number of penalties we impose, the amount of each penalty, and the adjustments, if any, we
make for a respondent’s financial circumstances. Each of these factors is within our discretion,
although that discretion must be exercised within statutory parameters.89
First, we may impose a separate civil money penalty for each of a respondent’s “act[s] or
omission[s]” willfully violating the securities laws.90 Although Congress specified additional

23
This variation in calculating the number of acts or omissions sanctioned in particular
cases is a feature of the discretion granted to us in the penalty regime that Congress created. The
securities laws prohibit a broad range of conduct that is not susceptible to a single definition. For
example, “Section 10(b) was designed as a catch-all clause to prevent fraudulent practices,”98
including not only “garden type variet[ies] of fraud” but also “unique form[s] of deception”
involving “[n]ovel or atypical methods.”99 And because conduct by an investment adviser that
violates Rule 10b-5 also violates Section 206, the reach of that section is similarly broad.100
Thus, our exact methodology for imposition of civil money penalties may vary from case to case,
as widely as the misconduct those penalties address. But that variation is rationalized by our
consistent consideration and application of the statutory parameters.101
In authorizing civil money penalties in our administrative proceedings, Congress
intended to provide us with flexibility to assess appropriate penalties on the disparate conduct
prohibited by the securities laws.102 Section 203(i) of the Advisers Act of 1940 authorizes us to
impose civil money penalties for “each” of a respondent’s “act[s] or omission[s]” willfully
violating the securities laws, including each such provision at issue here.103 Acting consistently
with this language, we have, at times, imposed separate penalties for each of a respondent’s
violative transactions.104 Federal courts also have construed the language of the penalty statute

(finding no abuse of discretion where Board affirmed ALJ’s assessment of relatively modest

amounts actually imposed”).

25
That being said, assessing penalties on the basis of a unit of time, without an explanation
of how the units of time relate to acts or omissions, may not comply with the penalty statute.110
In Rapoport, the D.C. Circuit expressed skepticism regarding a law judge’s civil penalty
determination where, although he acknowledged the need to determine “whether to treat the
entire course of conduct [at issue] as a single act or as a series of acts, as to which multiple
penalties would be appropriate,” he “imposed the maximum penalty on each respondent five
times—once for each year” during which misconduct occurred—without explaining why.111
Citing Rapoport, the law judge in this case recognized the need to “determine how many
violations occurred and how many are attributable to each person” on whom penalties are
imposed.112 And she identified some authority supporting her conclusion that “it would be
reasonable to assess a penalty for each month [a] cherry-picking scheme occurred.”113 But the
law judge did not identify an evidentiary basis to conclude that one or more “act[s] or
omission[s]” violating the securities laws occurred during each month for which she imposed a
civil penalty.114
Second, for each act or omission that we determine to sanction we may impose up to a
statutory maximum civil money penalty provided that it is consistent with the public interest.115
There are no minimum or fixed penalties. Advisers Act Section 203(i)(2) specifies three
periodically adjusted116 tiers of maximum penalties, which are applicable to increasingly serious
misconduct.117 First-tier penalties require no additional statutory showing. But before we

impose a second-tier penalty, we must find that the misconduct we sanction “involved fraud,
deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory requirement.”118 And we
may impose third-tier penalties only for such misconduct that also “directly or indirectly resulted
in substantial losses or created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons or resulted
in substantial pecuniary gain to the person who committed the act or omission.”119 Within each
tier, maximum penalties for natural persons are lower than for other persons.120 In determining
what level of penalty to impose under the appropriate tier, we may consider the factors relevant
to the public interest, as well as the number of acts or omissions we chose to penalize.
Third, we also “may, in [our] discretion” consider properly submitted evidence of a
respondent’s ability to pay penalties.121 But “[e]ven when a respondent demonstrates an inability
to pay, we have discretion not to waive the penalty, . . . particularly when the misconduct is
sufficiently egregious.”122 And a respondent waives a claim of inability to pay by failing to raise

The public interest requires stringent penalties against J.S. Oliver and
Mausner for their misconduct.

We find that it is in the public interest to impose stringent penalties against J.S. Oliver
and Mausner for their misconduct.124 We impose $1,325,000 in penalties on Mausner and
$6,625,000 on J.S. Oliver for their willful violations of the securities laws.
We start with our analysis of the public interest, an inquiry that Respondents do not
address. J.S. Oliver and Mausner engaged in fraud and deceit by cherry picking and failing to
disclose their uses of soft dollars. By cherry picking, they caused clients over $10.9 million in
first-day losses, and they also misused over $1.1 million of soft dollars (client assets).
Respondents were unjustly enriched because they used those soft dollars for purposes they did
not disclose to clients and received nearly $225,000 in fees for CGF, one of the funds that they
favored over three client accounts and promoted on the basis of inflated performance. Although
they settled an arbitration with one disfavored client, they do not attempt to show that they made
any restitution of the amounts we order disgorged.125 Moreover, although J.S. Oliver and
Mausner have no disciplinary history, their misconduct (which continued over an extended
period, i.e., June 2008 to November 2011) was serious, calculated, and grossly breached their
fiduciary duties to clients through what essentially amounted to theft. Respondents’ misconduct
also permeated nearly every aspect of their business because it involved the trading in their most
active accounts and the use of soft dollars obtained from broker commissions. And the factors
we discussed in support of our decision to impose an industry bar on Mausner also weigh heavily
in favor of a substantial penalty.126
We also find that there is a significant need for heavy penalties to deter J.S. Oliver,
Mausner, and others from engaging in cherry-picking and soft dollar violations. Congress
recognized that penalties “should be higher if the violation is of a type that is difficult to
detect.”127 Cherry picking is, by its nature, difficult to detect because an investment adviser’s

clients cannot see how the adviser allocates block trades. It appears that Respondents assumed
that their conduct would not be discovered. They cherry picked for 18 months, and during this
period, they repeatedly put off the principal of one disfavored client when he pressed for an
explanation of the performance of the client’s disfavored account. Even after the client left J.S.
Oliver, Mausner continued cherry picking. Respondents also failed to disclose their uses of soft
dollars. By its nature, this nondisclosure was necessarily difficult to detect. It is important to
deter Respondents (notwithstanding the industry bar and revocation orders),128 and others, from
engaging in this conduct in the future.
The Division requests that, like the initial decision, we impose 18 separate maximum
third-tier penalties on each of J.S. Oliver and Mausner for their 18-month long cherry picking,
and four maximum third-tier penalties on each of them for their failures to disclose to clients four
separate uses of soft dollars. Respondents do not contend that these penalties are inconsistent
with the statute. Rather, they assert that the law judge did not comply with principles of
reasoned decision-making because she penalized Respondents’ cherry picking on a monthly
basis but imposed a separate penalty for each subject of their soft dollar omissions. Respondents
contend that the law judge should have explained in more detail her basis for imposing monthly
cherry picking penalties, why she counted the cherry picking and soft dollar violations
differently for penalty purposes, and why she did not use one of the other methods of counting
violations that the Commission or law judges have used in the past.129 We address Respondents’
arguments to the extent that they raise issues relevant to our own penalty calculations.130
Respondents’ misconduct involved repeated calculated violations of the securities laws,
and its gravity does not merit that we assess only a single penalty for an ongoing course of
conduct. Instead, we impose 15 maximum second-tier penalties on each of J.S. Oliver and
Mausner for their cherry picking, representing one penalty for each of 15 acts of cherry picking

by the evidentiary record131—and four maximum second-tier penalties for their omissions to
disclose the separate soft dollar uses at issue. Second-tier penalties are appropriate because
Respondents engaged in fraud.132
The record supports a finding that Respondents engaged in at least 15 separate willful
acts of cherry picking in violation of the antifraud provisions, as required to impose 15 separate
penalties under Advisers Act Section 203(i)(2)(B).133 We find that Glasserman’s expert analysis
establishes that J.S. Oliver and Mausner engaged in at least one act of cherry picking during each
month between and including June 2008 and November 2009, a total of 18 months. The
Division observes that Glasserman “offered a detailed analysis that calculated the disparity in
performance between the favored and disfavored accounts during each” of these months, which
is reflected in an exhibit to his report.134 This analysis shows significant disparities between
average monthly first-day returns in each month at issue: in 14 of the 18 months, average firstday returns for favored accounts are positive and average first-day returns for the disfavored
accounts are negative, and in the remaining months the negative returns for the disfavored
accounts significantly exceed those of the favored accounts. Glasserman’s findings are
particularly persuasive when considered with his analysis of Mausner’s trade allocations over the
period as a whole. Indeed, Respondents do not dispute that the evidence establishes that they

See Exhibit 5 to Glasserman expert report. Glasserman’s expert report reflects that, in
performing this monthly analysis, he reviewed and relied on J.S. Oliver’s trade blotter in
conjunction with other evidence of securities prices. In an addendum to his report, Glasserman
also identifies certain “specific allocation audit trail report[s]” for various trade dates in the years
2008 through 2010 that he consulted. Glasserman relied on this data to provide “a narrower set
of ‘same day, same security’ transactions,” which he concluded in his report provided “further
statistical evidence of cherry-picking” beyond his analysis of the trade blotter. At oral argument,
counsel for the Division acknowledged that Glasserman did not list any audit trail reports for
July 2009 as documents consulted in his report. This does not undermine our conclusion that
Respondents engaged in at least one cherry-picking transaction in each month over the relevant
period, including July 2009. First, Glasserman did not rely on the audit trail reports in Exhibit 5
or in his principal analysis of cherry picking over the relevant period, which concluded that the
evidence “overwhelmingly” showed that Respondents engaged in cherry picking. Thus, any
“gap” in the audit trail reports is irrelevant to our determination that Respondents engaged in at
least one act of cherry-picking during the 15-month period. Second, the record separately
contains trade allocation data for July 2009, so there is not a gap in the trade data for that month.
Third, Respondents did not challenge the Division’s assertion that Exhibit 5 provides a basis to
conclude that they engaged in at least one cherry-picking trade a month during the relevant
period.

30
engaged in at least one act of cherry picking during each month of the 18-month relevant period.
By fraudulently allocating trades at least once a month, Respondents “employ[ed]” a “device,
scheme, or artifice to defraud”135 or “engage[d]” in an “act,” “transaction, practice, or course of
business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit”136 at least 18 times over the
relevant period. But only 15 of these 18 acts occurred within the five years before the order
instituting proceedings was issued, and, although Respondents did not raise a statute of
limitations defense,137 we exercise our discretion to limit the penalties we impose for cherry
picking to those 15 acts.138
The Division requests that we impose third-tier penalties for Respondents’ cherry picking
because it “involved fraud” and caused substantial losses of $10.9 million to the three disfavored
accounts.139 And at oral argument, counsel for Respondents twice stated that they were not
challenging the tier of the penalties that the law judge imposed. Based on our consideration of
the relevant public interest factors and the facts of this case, however, we exercise our discretion
to impose maximum second-tier penalties.140 We impose total cherry-picking penalties of
$1,055,000 on Mausner and $5,275,000 on J.S. Oliver for seven acts between September 2008
and March 2009 at applicable maximum penalties of $65,000 and $325,000 per act and eight acts
between April 2009 and November 2009 at applicable maximum penalties of $75,000 and
$375,000.141 The penalty we impose on J.S. Oliver is slightly less than half the $10.9 million in
harm it caused its clients through cherry picking, and the penalty on Mausner is lower.
Although the parties do not attempt to calculate a precise number of cherry-picking
violations, it appears from the record that the actual number of acts or omissions constituting

cherry picking could be much greater. J.S. Oliver engaged in more than 23,000 transactions over
the relevant period, and during that time, its prime broker identified in excess of 4,000
transactions on 167 trading days as potential instances of self-dealing. The favored and
disfavored accounts that were the subject of Respondents’ cherry picking made up approximately
98% of J.S. Oliver’s total trading volume over the relevant period, and Glasserman opined that
Mausner’s misconduct “affected virtually all of J.S. Oliver’s equity trading on behalf of its
clients.” Thus, it would appear that with further analysis of trade and allocation data, we could
be justified in finding a much larger number of acts or omissions, although this alone would not
establish that a greater penalty was appropriate in the public interest. But given the record before
us and our consideration of the public interest based on all the relevant statutory factors, we
believe that the 15 instances we have identified are substantially justified for assessing maximum
second-tier penalties for cherry picking.
Given the amount of the penalties we impose for cherry-picking, we also determine in
our discretion to impose maximum second-tier penalties for each of Respondents’ four failures to
disclose a separate use of soft dollars.142 Because Advisers Act Section 203(i) specifically
authorizes us to sanction each “act or omission” violating the securities laws,143 our decision to
penalize each of Respondents’ separate failures to disclose their use of soft dollars also complies
with the statute.144 These sanctions reflect that the primary nature of Respondents’ soft dollar
misconduct was in failing to disclose separate soft dollar uses. We apply the applicable secondtier maximum penalties for the three omissions beginning before March 3, 2009 ($65,000 and
$325,000) and the higher applicable maximum penalties ($75,000 and $375,000) for the fourth
omission that began in June 2009 (the payment to Mausner’s former spouse). For their soft
dollar violations, we thus assess additional penalties of $270,000 (three $65,000 penalties plus an
additional $75,000 penalty) on Mausner and $1,350,000 (three $325,000 penalties plus an
additional $375,000 penalty) on J.S. Oliver.

142

We are exercising our discretion with respect to penalties for soft dollar violations based
on the entirety of the facts and circumstances of this case. We can and have assessed third-tier
penalties for failure to disclose material conflicts of interest. See, e.g., Montford & Co., 2014
WL 1744130, at *25 (failure to disclose compensation); Zion Capital Mgmt., Release No.
48904A, 2003 WL 25596513, at *9 (Dec. 11, 2003) (failure to disclose conflict of interest).
143

See Advisers Act Section 203(i)(2)(B), 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(i)(2)(B) (setting “maximum
amount of [second-tier] penalty for each such act or omission”) (emphasis added).
144

See Montford & Co, 2014 WL 1744130, at *25 (imposing two civil money penalties on
each of firm and its principal where “[o]n two separate occasions, Respondents failed to
immediately alert clients, by full and fair disclosure, of information bearing directly on their
advisory independence and critical to the clients’ investment decisions”); see also Maria T.
Giesige, Exchange Act Release No. 60000, 2009 WL 1507584, at *8 (May 29, 2009) (stating
that “Giesige made numerous and repeated misstatements and omissions to each of her
approximately fifty customers who purchased Carolina Development securities, and the
Commission has the authority to assess a penalty for each of these individual violations”).

32
We reject Respondents’ argument that imposing monthly penalties for cherry picking is
internally inconsistent with imposing a separate penalty for each use of soft dollars that
Respondents failed to disclose. Our decision to do so reflects the differing nature of
Respondents’ two types of misconduct (one centered on repeated affirmative acts and the other
on omissions), and is consistent with the flexibility authorized by Congress through the penalty
statute.145 These methods of calculation also strike a balance between ends of a spectrum.
Penalizing Respondents’ violations as two unitary course of conduct, each warranting a single
penalty, is too lenient given the gravity of their misconduct. On the other hand, in our discretion
and on the facts of this case, we decline to use a method of counting that would yield a larger
number of total penalties. As explained above, we decline to impose a separate penalty for each
cherry-picking transaction.146 And although a different method of counting soft dollar violations
might result in a greater number of penalties (e.g., counting the undisclosed payments or some
other method identified by Respondents), assuming it were consistent with the statute, we find it
unnecessary given the total amount of penalties we impose.147 In all, we assess total civil money
penalties of $1,325,000 on Mausner and $6,625,000 on J.S. Oliver for their cherry-picking acts
and soft dollar omissions. In our discretion, we do not order them to pay penalties for their other
violations of the securities laws.
J.S. Oliver and Mausner argue that imposing stringent civil money penalties is excessive
because “the record establishes that neither firm nor principal have substantial assets.” We
disagree. Respondents failed to offer the financial records required by our rules to support such
an argument.148 Congress believed that it was “appropriate that respondents have the obligation
to present evidence of their ability to pay, since they have better access to their financial records”
than we do.149 Moreover, the evidence that Respondents marshal in favor of their argument is
not persuasive. The initial decision did not conclude that they could have been forced into
bankruptcy by an earlier settlement, as they contend. Instead, it found—consistent with the
record—that Respondents threatened bankruptcy to avoid payment of the full settlement. And
Respondents’ decision to proceed pro se before the law judge and to run J.S. Oliver’s operations
out of Mausner’s one-time residence also do not establish an inability to pay. In any event, we
have the discretion to impose penalties notwithstanding a respondent’s financial circumstances,

and we find that J.S. Oliver and Mausner’s misconduct is egregious enough for us to have done
so here had they established their financial circumstances.150
Respondents raise one final attack on the amount of civil money penalties, which we also
reject. Citing the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Collins v. SEC, they assert that the initial decision
erred because the penalties it imposed were “out of line” with our precedent.151 They argue that
we generally impose penalties that “bear a proportional relationship to other dollar figures in a
case” and ask us to cap the amount of the penalties imposed at the amount of disgorgement we
order. Respondents’ argument fails for three reasons.
First, we reject Respondents’ request to set civil penalties at no more than disgorgement
because our “broad discretion in fashioning sanctions in the public interest cannot be strictly
cabined according to some mechanical formula.”152 Further, in Collins, the D.C. Circuit
recognized that the penalty statute “seems to demand that [we] look beyond harm to victims or
gains enjoyed by perpetrators” and “lists harm to other persons as only one of five specific
factors (plus the catch-all reference to ‘such other matters as justice may require’).”153 And
unlike the civil money penalty statutes that apply to federal court securities enforcement actions,
the penalty statute here does not authorize us to impose civil penalties equal to a respondent’s
pecuniary gain as an alternative to penalties based on acts or omissions.154 In any event, it is
reasonable for disgorgement and civil money penalties to differ because they serve different
purposes: unlike penalties, “[d]isgorgement serves to remedy securities law violations by
150

See supra note 122 and accompanying text. Citing Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d at 1137,
Respondents also contend that “when the Commission chooses to order the most drastic
remedies at its disposal, it has a greater burden to show with particularity the facts and policies
that support those sanctions and why less severe action would not serve to protect investors.”
But courts have rejected this burden. See, e.g., Paz Sec., Inc. v. SEC, 566 F.3d 1172, 1176 (D.C.
Cir. 2009) (citing Rizek v. SEC, 215 F.3d 157, 161 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining Steadman says “no
more than . . . that agencies must sufficiently articulate the grounds of their decisions”)).

See Collins, 736 F.3d at 526 (stating that “[r]eview for whether an agency’s sanction is

agency’s decisions in other cases”). But see supra notes 79 and 80 and accompanying text
(explaining that agency is not required to make its sanctions uniform).

depriving violators of the fruits of their illegal conduct” and “does not serve a punitive
function.”155
Second, even if Respondents were correct that it is necessary for penalties to be
proportional to other numbers in the case because “the penalty statute’s use of a test that is multifactorial” makes other comparisons too difficult,156 the penalties we impose here meet that test.
The total penalties that we assess on J.S. Oliver ($6,625,000) are somewhat more than one-half
the sum of the $10.9 million in harm that Respondents caused the disfavored accounts plus the
$1,376,440 in disgorgement we order. The total penalties on Mausner ($1,325,000) are much
lower and are slightly less than disgorgement. These penalties are thus proportional to other
figures in the case, as Respondents urge. There is no “huge excess of the penalty over other
relevant dollar figures,” and thus this case is not a “stark outlier,” as Respondents claim with
respect to the initial decision.
Our penalties are also well within the range of multiples of disgorgement that the D.C.
Circuit has identified in our proceedings. In Collins, the court observed civil penalties in
administrative proceedings “ranging from roughly one-half of the disgorgement amount . . . to
about 25 times” disgorgement, but ultimately sustained a penalty imposed on an individual that
was over 100 times disgorgement.157 And as Respondents highlight, we have imposed civil
penalties where we have ordered no disgorgement at all.158 In this case, the range identified in
Collins is $688,220 to $34,411,000, and 100 times disgorgement would be $137,644,000. The
total penalties we impose on both Respondents ($7,950,000) do not approach the midpoint of the
range of one-half to 25 times disgorgement ($17,549,610).
Finally, Respondents’ assertion that we must justify every penalty imposed as consistent
with prior decisions fails because it would overrule long-standing precedent providing that
administrative sanctions are not invalid because they are “more severe than sanctions imposed in
other cases.”159 Indeed, J.S. Oliver and Mausner concede that “the Commission is not obligated
to make its sanctions uniform.”160 Although Respondents deny it, their assertion that we should
limit penalties to the amount of disgorgement would impose precisely such a requirement here.

IV.
Respondents argue that Chief ALJ Brenda P. Murray—who presided over this matter and
issued the Initial Decision—was not appointed in a manner consistent with the Appointments
Clause of the Constitution. We find that the appointment of Commission ALJs is not subject to
the requirements of the Appointments Clause.
Under the Appointments Clause, certain high-level government officials must be
appointed in particular ways: “Principal officers” must be appointed by the President (and
confirmed by the Senate), while “inferior officers” must be appointed either by the President, the
heads of departments, or the courts of law.161 The great majority of government personnel are
neither principal nor inferior officers, but rather “mere employees” whose appointments are not
restricted by the Appointments Clause.162 The Division does not dispute that Chief ALJ Murray
was not appointed by the President, the head of a department, or a court of law.163 Respondents
therefore contend that her appointment violates the Appointments Clause because, in their view,
Chief ALJ Murray should be deemed an inferior officer. The Division counters that she is an
employee and thus there was no violation of the Appointments Clause.
As we have previously explained,164 the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Landry v. FDIC
guides our resolution of this question.165 Landry held that, for purposes of the Appointments
Clause, ALJs at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), who oversee
administrative proceedings to remove bank executives, are employees rather than inferior
officers. Landry explained that the touchstone for determining whether adjudicators are inferior
officers is the extent to which they have the power to issue “final decisions.”166 Although ALJs
161

The Clause provides that the President “by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
shall appoint . . . Officers of the United States . . . but the Congress may by Law vest the
Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts
of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2.

204 F.3d 1125 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

Id. at 1133-34. Respondents assert that the Commission has changed its views on this
point, having previously taken the position in Free Enterprise Fund that members of the PCAOB
were inferior officers even though they lacked authority to issue final decisions. See Brief for
the United States, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477
(2010) (No. 08-861), 2009 WL 3290435 (Oct. 13, 2009). Respondents misapprehend what was

at the FDIC take testimony, conduct trial-like hearings, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and
have the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders, they “can never render the decision
of the FDIC.”167 Instead, they issue only “recommended decisions,” which the FDIC Board of
Directors reviews de novo, and “[f]inal decisions are issued only by the FDIC Board.”168 The
FDIC ALJs thus function as aides who assist the Board in its duties, not officers who exercise
significant authority independent of the Board’s supervision. Because ALJs at the FDIC “have
no such powers” of “final decision,” the D.C. Circuit “conclude[d] that they are not inferior
officers.”169
The mix of duties and powers of the Commission’s ALJs are very similar to those of the
ALJs at the FDIC. Like the FDIC’s ALJs, the Commission’s ALJs conduct hearings, take
testimony, rule on admissibility of evidence, and issue subpoenas. And like the FDIC’s ALJs,
the Commission’s ALJs do not issue the final decisions that result from such proceedings. Just
as the FDIC’s ALJs issue only “recommended decisions” that are not final, the Commission’s
ALJs issue “initial decisions” that are likewise not final.170 Respondents may petition the
Commission for review of an ALJ’s initial decision,171 and it is our “longstanding practice [to]
grant[] virtually all [such] petitions for review.”172 Indeed, we are “unaware of any case in
which the Commission has declined to grant” a respondent’s timely petition for review from an
ALJ’s initial decision.173 Absent a petition, we may also choose to review a decision on our own
initiative.174 In either case, our rules expressly provide that “the initial decision [of an ALJ] shall

at issue in Free Enterprise Fund. There, it was “undisputed” that PCAOB Board members were
inferior officers, so there was no occasion to address the distinction between mere employees
and inferior officers. See id. at 29 n.8. Further, that case did not turn on the absence or presence
of adjudicative finality, because PCAOB Board members performed “enforcement or
policymaking functions.” Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 507 n.10.

Commission will issue an order that the decision has become final,” and it becomes final only

177

We do not view the fact that we accord our ALJs deference in the context of demeanorbased credibility determinations to vest them with the type of authority that would qualify them
as inferior officers. First, as we have repeatedly made clear, we do not accept such findings
“blindly,” and we will “disregard explicit determinations of credibility” when our de novo review
of the record as a whole convinces us that a witness’s testimony is credible (or not) or that the
weight of the evidence warrants a different finding as to the ultimate facts at issue. Kenneth R.

F.3d 1184, 1189 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“The law is settled that an agency is not required to adopt the

is no different from the FDIC’s and so does not warrant a departure from Landry. Compare
[Redacted] (Insured State Nonmember Bank), FDIC-82-73a, 1984 WL 273918, at *5 (June 18,
1984) (stating, “as a general rule,” that “the assessment of the credibility of witnesses” by the
FDIC’s ALJs is given “deference” by the FDIC) with Ramon M. Candelaria, FDIC-95-62e, 1997
WL 211341, at *3-4 (Mar. 11, 1997) (noting that the FDIC ALJ found respondent to be “entirely
credible” but rejecting respondent’s testimony “in light of the entire record”).

part,” any initial decision.178 And “any procedural errors” made by an ALJ in conducting the
hearing “are cured” by our “thorough, de novo review of the record.”179 We may expand the
record by “hear[ing] additional evidence” ourselves or remanding for further proceedings before
the ALJ, and may “make any findings or conclusions that in [our] judgment are proper and on
the basis of the record.”180
Respondents suggest that our ALJs are functionally comparable to, and enjoy as much
discretion as, Article III trial judges. But that is not the case. A trial judge’s factual findings are
afforded significant deference by reviewing courts, while we do not defer to our ALJs’ findings.
And although ALJs may oversee the taking and hearing of evidence, we have made clear that we
have “plenary authority over the course of [our] administrative proceedings and the rulings of
[our] law judges—both before and after the issuance of the initial decision and irrespective of
whether any party has sought relief.”181 This includes authority over all evidentiary and
discovery-related rulings. We are not limited by the record that comes to us. As explained
above, we may expand the record. The fact that our ALJs may rule initially on evidentiary
matters and discovery issues (subject to our de novo review) does not distinguish them from the
FDIC’s ALJs in Landry who have the same authority.
Respondents rely on several decisions in which district courts have found that the
Commission’s ALJs are inferior officers.182 Those decisions decline to follow the D.C. Circuit’s
reasoning in Landry and rely instead on Freytag v. Commissioner,183 in which the Supreme
Court held that a “special trial judge” of the Tax Court was an inferior officer. But we agree
with Landry’s analysis and the distinctions that the D.C. Circuit identified between ALJs and the
special trial judges at issue in Freytag.184 The greater role and powers of the special trial judges

Landry, 204 F.3d at 1133 (explaining that the special trial judges at issue in Freytag
exercised “authority . . . not matched by the ALJs”).

39
relative to Commission ALJs, in our view, makes Freytag inapposite here. First, unlike the ALJs
whose decisions are reviewed de novo, the special trial judges made factual findings to which the
Tax Court was required to defer, unless clearly erroneous.185 Second, the special trial judges
were authorized by statute to “render the [final] decisions of the Tax Court” in significant, fullylitigated proceedings involving declaratory judgments and amounts in controversy below
$10,000.186 As discussed above, our ALJs issue initial decisions that are not final unless the
Commission takes some further action. Third, the Tax Court (and by extension the court’s
special tax judges) exercised “a portion of the judicial power of the United States,” including the
“authority to punish contempts by fine or imprisonment.”187 Commission ALJs, by contrast, do
not possess such authority.188 And while Commission ALJs may issue subpoenas to compel
compliance, they are powerless to enforce their subpoenas; the Commission must seek and then
obtain an order from a federal district court to compel compliance.189 In this respect, too, our
ALJs are akin to the FDIC’s ALJs that Landry found to be “mere employees.”190
Respondents also rely on three cases involving military judges, which are inapposite
because those judges possessed far greater powers than do our ALJs (or the FDIC’s ALJs). They
could, for example, decide “court-martial proceedings that result in the most serious sentences”
(including death, dishonorable discharge, or imprisonment);191 make conclusive determinations
about the factual sufficiency of the evidence;192 or render findings to which reviewing courts

188

See Rule of Practice 180, 17 C.F.R. § 201.180. The Commission’s rules provide ALJs
with authority to punish contemptuous conduct in only the following, limited ways: If a person
engages in contemptuous conduct before the ALJ during any proceeding, the ALJ may “exclude
that person from such hearing or conference, or any portion thereof” or “summarily suspend that
person from representing others in the proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the
duration, or any portion, of the proceeding.” Id. § 201.180(a). If there are deficiencies in a
filing, a Commission ALJ “may reject, in whole or in part,” the filing, such filing “shall not be
part of the record,” and the ALJ “may direct a party to cure any deficiencies.” Id. § 201.180(b).
Finally, if a party fails to make a required filing or to cure a deficiency with a filing, then a
Commission ALJ “may enter a default . . . , dismiss the case, decide the particular matter at issue
against that person, or prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning that
matter.” Id. § 201.180(c). Any such ruling would, of course, be subject to de novo Commission
review.

were required to defer.193 In short, not all judges possess the same stature or exercise the same
powers, and that the Commission’s ALJs may carry out some of the same tasks as other officials
who also are denominated “judges” does not mean they have the requisite significant authority to
qualify as inferior officers.
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the mix of duties and powers of our ALJs is
similar in all material respects to the duties and role of the FDIC’s ALJs in Landry.194
Accordingly, we follow Landry, and we conclude that our ALJs are not “inferior officers” under
the Appointments Clause.195

We do not find any relevance in the fact that the federal securities laws and our
regulations at times refer to ALJs as “officers” or “hearing officers.” There is no indication that
Congress intended “officers” or “hearing officers” to be synonymous with “Officers of the
United States,” U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and the word “officer” in our regulations has no
such meaning. We also note in this regard that the Administrative Procedure Act “consistently
uses the term ‘officer’ or the term ‘officer, employee, or agent’” to “refer to [agency] staff
members.” Kenneth Culp Davis, Separation of Functions in Administrative Agencies, 61 HARV.
L. REV. 612, 615 & n.11 (1948). Cf. 5 U.S.C. §§ 556, 557 (referring to the individual who
presides over a hearing as the “presiding employee”).
195

Beyond Landry, we believe that our ALJs are properly deemed employees (rather than
inferior officers) because this is how Congress has chosen to classify them, and that decision is
entitled to considerable deference. See Burnap v. United States, 252 U.S. 512, 516 (1920). For
example, as we discussed above, Congress created and placed ALJ positions within the
competitive service system, just like most other federal employees. Like such other employees,
an ALJ who believes that his employing agency has engaged in a prohibited personnel practice
can seek redress either through the Office of Special Counsel or the Merit Systems Protection
Board. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1204, 1212, 1214, 1215, 1221. And ALJs—like other employees—are
subject to reductions-in-force. See id. § 7521(b).
196

We have considered all of the parties’ contentions. We have rejected or sustained them
to the extent that they are inconsistent or in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.
