SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against D’Arelli Pruzansky, P.A. (“Pruzansky, P.A.”),
Joseph D’Arelli, CPA (“D’Arelli”), and Mitchell J. Pruzansky, CPA (“Pruzansky”) (collectively,
“Respondents”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
SUMMARY
This matter involves violations of the auditor independence rules arising from the failure by
D’Arelli Pruzansky, P.A. and its two founding partners, Joseph D’Arelli and Mitchell J. Pruzansky,
to comply with audit partner rotation requirements during the course of their engagement as the
independent auditor for five reporting company clients with securities registered with the
Commission under Section 12 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the “issuer clients”).
Specifically, in 2014 and 2015, D’Arelli and Pruzansky failed to rotate off the audit engagements
after serving as lead audit partners for five consecutive fiscal years. As a result, the Respondents
were not independent with respect to the interim review services they provided the issuer clients.
These failures caused the issuer clients to file quarterly reports with the Commission that were not
reviewed by an independent public accountant as required by Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act.

FACTS
Issuer Engagements
4.
D’Arelli commenced his role as lead audit partner for one of the issuer clients in
2010, while employed at another PCAOB-registered audit firm. Between 2010 and 2014, he
served as the issuer client’s lead audit partner for each of the five fiscal year audits and continued
to serve as lead audit partner for the quarterly reviews after the fifth fiscal year. D’Arelli rotated
off serving as the client’s lead audit partner prior to the sixth fiscal year audit.
5.
Pruzansky similarly commenced his role as lead audit partner for the other four
issuer clients in 2009, also while employed at another PCAOB-registered audit firm, and served as
lead audit partner on five fiscal year audits for each. Following the fifth fiscal year audits, he
served as lead audit partner for certain quarterly reviews for these four issuer clients. Pruzansky
rotated off serving as the clients’ lead audit partner prior to the sixth fiscal year audit for each
client.
6.
During a PCAOB inspection in July 2015, the Firm was informed by the PCAOB
inspection staff that it had failed to comply with the SEC’s partner rotation requirements with
regard to two issuer audit clients. Specifically, D’Arelli and Pruzansky (collectively, the
“Partners”) failed to rotate off the audit engagements as lead audit partners after the required five
fiscal year period.
7.
In August 2015, the Firm reviewed all of its engagements to identify the universe of
issuer audit clients that may have had a similar rotation issue. This review found that the rotation
issue existed for three additional issuer clients. Thus, the Firm and the Partners were not
independent with respect to the audit services they provided to five issuer clients in connection
with certain quarterly reviews as listed below. The Firm self-reported these violations to the
Commission’s staff and took prompt remedial measures.

Auditor Partner Rotation and Independence
8.
Section 10A(j) of the Exchange Act, Audit Partner Rotation, provides “[i]t shall be
unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide audit services to an issuer if the lead (or
coordinating) audit partner (having primary responsibility for the audit), or the audit partner
responsible for reviewing the audit, has performed audit services for that issuer in each of the
3

previous five fiscal years of that issuer.” Rule 10A-2 of the Exchange Act, Auditor Independence,
provides that it shall be unlawful for an auditor not to be independent with respect to, among other
requirements, the partner rotation requirements of the Commission’s Regulation S-X. Rule 201(c)(6)(i)(A) of Regulation S-X allows engagement and concurring partners to serve for five
consecutive years, after which they may not serve in either role for another period of five years.
9.
The Firm was not independent with respect to the various 2014 and 2015 quarterly
reviews for the five issuer clients, as a consequence of D’Arelli’s failure to rotate off the
engagement on the quarterly review of one issuer client’s first three quarters of 2015, and
Pruzansky’s failure to rotate off the engagement on the various quarterly reviews for the other four
issuer clients in 2014.
10.
D’Arelli and Pruzansky had previously served as lead engagement partners on these
engagements for five consecutive years and were not eligible to serve in that role for any review or
audit for the next five consecutive years.
11.
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 require issuers with securities
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the Commission accurate quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q. No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section 13(a)
or the rules thereunder. See SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc. 587 F.2d 1149, 1166-67 (D.C. Cir. 1978).
12.
The above-described actions by the Firm and the Partners caused the five issuer
clients, all of which had securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to violate
Section 13a of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder. Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X
requires the interim financial statements included in a Form 10-Q to be reviewed by an
independent public accountant. The Firm’s and the Partners’ rotation violations caused the issuer
clients to fail to comply with Rule 10-01(d) and, in turn, violate Section 13(a) and Rule 13a-13.
VIOLATIONS
13.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent D’Arelli Pruzansky, P.A.
violated Section 10A(j) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10A-2 thereunder, which makes it unlawful
for an auditor not to be independent with respect to, among other requirements, the partner rotation
requirements.
14.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents D’Arelli and Pruzansky
caused the Firm’s violations of Section 10A(j) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10A-2 thereunder.
15.
Also as a result of the conduct described above, Respondents caused the five issuer
clients to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder.

Exchange Act and Rules 10A-2 and 13a-13 thereunder.
B.
Respondents shall jointly and severally pay a civil penalty of $50,000 to the
Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States

Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

(2)

proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or
money order must be sent to Glenn S. Gordon, Associate Regional Director, Miami Regional
Office, Securities and Exchange Commission, 801 Brickell Avenue, Suite 1800, Miami, FL 33131.
C.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action”
means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

Respondents Joseph D’Arelli and Mitchell J. Pruzansky, and further, any debt for disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondents Joseph D’Arelli and

regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy
Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
