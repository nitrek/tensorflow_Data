ORDER DETERMINING WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD CLAIM
(“Claimant 1”),
Claimant #2
(“Claimant 2”), and Claimant #3
(“Claimant 3”) (collectively, “Claimants”) failed to submit their claims for an award for Notice
of Covered Action Redacted to the Office of the Whistleblower (“OWB)” within ninety (90)
calendar days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action (“NoCA”), as Rule 21F-10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act (“Exchange Act”) requires for award consideration.1 As a result, the
Claims Review Staff (“CRS”) issued a Preliminary Determination recommending that each
Claimants’ untimely claim be denied. 2
Claimant #1

For the reasons set forth below, each Claimant’s award claim is denied.

Background

Rule 21F-10(b), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(b), provides:
To file a claim for a whistleblower award, you must file Form WB-APP, Application for
Award for Original Information Provided Pursuant to Section 21F of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (referenced in § 249.1801 of this chapter). You must sign this form
as the claimant and submit it to the Office of the Whistleblower by mail or fax. All claim
forms, including any attachments, must be received by the Office of the Whistleblower
within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of the Notice of Covered Action in order to be
considered for an award. 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(b).

the OWB posted NoCA Redacted for this covered action. On Redacted
, the 90-day period established by Rule 21F-10(b) to submit an award claim expired without
any of the three Claimants having made a submission. Instead, the three Claimants submitted
their award claims approximately two years after the deadline.3 On June 5, 2015, the CRS issued
a Preliminary Determination recommending that each Claimant’s award claim be denied due to
untimeliness.

Pursuant to Rule 21F-10(e),4 the three Claimants subsequently submitted written
responses contesting the Preliminary Determination.5 In their responses the Claimants did not
dispute that their claims were late. Rather, they argued that the Commission should excuse their
untimely filings due to certain purported “extraordinary circumstances.” While the Claimants
each raise different contentions as to why extraordinary circumstances excused their late
submissions, none of the Claimants’ claims that the delay was caused by factors outside his
control. Rather, the Claimants assert that extraordinary circumstances should be found because
of purported mistakes committed by the Commission in its investigation and in the prosecution
of the enforcement action, the purported importance of the information the claimants provided to
the staff during its investigation and continue to provide in the subsequent SB bankruptcy
proceeding, and the Commission’s failure to directly notify the Claimants of the posting of the
NoCA and the deadline for submitting an award application.
II. Analysis
At the outset, we think it is important to observe that the 90-day deadline set forth in Rule
21F-10(b) serves several important programmatic functions. The deadline ensures fairness to
potential claimants by giving all an equal opportunity to have their competing claims evaluated
at the same time. The deadline also brings finality to the claims process so that we can make

Claimant 1 filed an award application on Form WB-APP dated March 31, 2014, almost two years after the
application deadline. Claimant 1’s application stated that it was also made on behalf of Claimants 2 and 3, although
it was only signed by Claimant 1. Claimants 2 and 3 subsequently submitted their own award applications on Forms
WB-APP on July 14, 2014 and July 15, 2014, respectively.

Rule 21F-10(e), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(e), provides that a claimant seeking to contest a Preliminary
Determination may submit a written response within the specified period under the rule “setting forth the grounds
for your objection to either the denial of an award or the proposed amount of an award.”

Claimants 1 and 2 requested oral argument before the Commission. We are denying those requests because we
find that argument would not benefit the Commission’s consideration of their award applications.

timely awards to meritorious whistleblowers.6
Notwithstanding these important programmatic functions, we recognize that there may be
rare situations where an exception should be made. To allow for this, Rule 21F-8(a) provides
that “the Commission may, in its sole discretion, waive” the 90-day filing requirement “upon a
showing of extraordinary circumstances.”7 We do not find that any of the three Claimants has
made the necessary showing to trigger our discretionary authority to waive the deadline.
In determining whether a claimant has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances to
excuse an untimely submission under Rule 21F-8(a), we have explained that “the ‘extraordinary
circumstances exception is to be narrowly construed and applied only in limited circumstances.”8
We have further explained that an extraordinary circumstance in the context of a late filing
requires a claimant to show that the reason for the failure to timely file was beyond the
claimant’s control.9 Further, we identified attorney misconduct or serious illness that presented
the applicant from making a timely filing as two examples of the demanding showing an
applicant must make for us to consider exercising our discretionary authority to excuse an
untimely filing.10
Applying that demanding standard here, we find that that none of the three Claimants has
demonstrated that their failure to timely file an award application was caused by factors beyond
their control. For example, neither the purported mistakes made by the Commission in its
investigation and enforcement action, nor the purported importance of the information provided
by the Claimants during the Commission’s investigation and the SB bankruptcy proceeding,
explains why circumstances beyond the Claimants’ control prevented them from timely filing
their award claims.
Finally, we disagree with the Claimants’ contention that the Commission had a duty to
notify the Claimants of the posting of the NoCA and the deadline for submitting an award
application, and that the failure to provide such notice constituted an extraordinary circumstance
justifying a waiver of the timing requirement. Rule 21F-10(a) provides for constructive, not
actual, notice of the posting of a covered action and of the deadline for submitting a claim.11 The

NoCA for this matter was clearly posted on the Commission’s website, along with the filing
deadline, which constitutes the requisite notice. As we have previously explained, “a lack of
awareness about the [whistleblower award] program does not . . . rise to the level of an
extraordinary circumstance as a general matter [since] potential claimants bear the ultimate
responsibility to learn about the program and to take the appropriate steps to perfect their award
applications.”12 A potential claimant’s responsibility includes the obligation to regularly monitor
the Commission’s web page for NoCA postings and to properly calculate the deadline for filing
an award claim. Here, the Claimants failed to do that, and their failures were not caused by an
extraordinary circumstance that might excuse the untimely award applications.13

Conclusion

Accordingly, upon due consideration under Rule 21F-10(h), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-10(h), it is
hereby ORDERED that the claims for whistleblower awards by Claimant 1, Claimant 2, and
Claimant 3 be, and hereby are, denied.

sanctions totaling more than $1,000,000, the Office of the Whistleblower will cause to be published on the
Commission’s website a ‘Notice of Covered Action’ . . . [and that] [a] claimant will have ninety (90) days from the
date of the Notice of Covered Action to file a claim for an award based on that action, or the claim will be barred.”
In our release adopting the final whistleblower rules, we explained that the constructive notice procedure of Rule
21F-10(a) “provides the best mechanism to provide notice to all whistleblower claimants who may have contributed
to the action’s success.” Implementing Release at *171.

Although the Claimants have not requested that we invoke our separate exemptive authority under Section 36(a)
of the Exchange Act, we would decline to do so if they had. Section 36(a) grants the Commission the authority in
certain circumstances to “exempt any person . . . from any provision or provisions of this title or of any rule or
regulation thereunder, to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is
consistent with the protection of investors.” We believe that none of the Claimants has met their burden to
demonstrate any considerations that would satisfy the requirements for us to exercise our Section 36(a) exemptive
authority.
