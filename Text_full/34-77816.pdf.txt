ORDER APPROVING PLAN
OF DISTRIBUTION

On December 1, 2005, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisors Act of 1940 and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
(“Order”) against American Express Financial Corporation (now known as Ameriprise
Financial, Inc.) (“AEFC” or “Respondent”). 1 The Order found that AEFC allowed
market timing in certain of its mutual funds and variable annuity products from January 1,
2002 through October 2003 that was contrary to fund prospectuses and not disclosed to
shareholders and AEFC directors. The Order required Respondent to pay disgorgement
of $10,000,000 and a civil money penalty of $5,000,000 and established a Fair Fund in
the total amount of $15,000,000 for a distribution to harmed investors pursuant to Section
308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.
On April 1, 2016, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (“Commission’s Rules”),
17 CFR § 201.1103. (Exchange Act Release No. 77497). The Notice advised all
interested parties that they may obtain a copy of the proposed plan of distribution
(“Distribution Plan”) from the Commission’s public website, http://www.sec.gov, or
by submitting a written request to Kara M. Washington, United States Securities and
Exchange Commission, 175 West Jackson Boulevard, Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60604.
The Notice also advised all persons desiring to comment on the Distribution
Plan could submit their comments, in writing, no later than 30 days from the date of
the Notice by sending a letter to the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities
and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549-1090; by
1

Advisers Act Rel. No. 2451 (December 1, 2005)

using the Commission’s Internet comment form
(http://www.sec.gov/litigation.admin.shtml); or by sending an e-mail to rulecomments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the Distribution Plan.
The Distribution Plan provides for distribution of the Fair Fund, plus any
accumulated interest, less any taxes and fees and expenses associated with
administering the distribution to Eligible Investors 2 who owned shares between
January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2003 in four mutual funds as described in the
Order. The Distribution Plan describes the procedures by which affected harmed
investors are identified, the procedures used to calculate the amounts to be paid to
these harmed investors, and how those amounts are to be distributed. Accordingly, the
affected harmed investors need not go through a claims-made process.
The Division of Enforcement now requests that the Commission approve the
Plan.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s
Rules, 17 CFR § 201.1104, that the Distribution Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
