Recommendations of the Investor Advisory Committee:
Impartiality in the Disclosure of Preliminary Voting Results (October 9, 2014)

Preliminary Observations:
The Investor as Owner Subcommittee (“Subcommittee”) has engaged in considerable
analysis of proxy plumbing issues. In connection with issues raised by members of the
Subcommittee and through the comment process, the Subcommittee has discussed the role of
brokers and banks in the proxy distribution process, as well as their agent, Broadridge Financial
Solutions (“Broadridge”).
Aspects of the process have been discussed on numerous occasions with the staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, Broadridge received drafts of these
recommendations and has had an opportunity to give comments orally and in writing.
Broadridge was also invited to, and did appear before, the Subcommittee to discuss these
recommendations. Subcommittee members also spoke with staff at Broadridge on numerous
occasions. In addition, the Subcommittee heard a presentation from one exempt solicitor. The
two recommendations arise out of these efforts.

A.

Overview

Most owners of public companies hold their shares through street name accounts. 1 The
shares in these accounts are typically registered in the name of a broker, bank, or depository.
State law extends voting rights to the registered owner. 2 Nonetheless, the federal securities laws,
in conjunction with the requirements of the stock exchanges, have in place a complex system that
guarantees street name owners the right to vote their shares.
Issuers are required to provide brokers and banks with copies of the relevant proxy
materials for distribution to beneficial owners. 3 Brokers and banks must forward the materials to

Exchange Act Release No. 69622 (May 23, 2013) (“According to the Exchange, over 80% of publicly held
securities are in street name today, and NYSE member organizations have contracted with Broadridge, a third-party
service provider, to handle almost all proxy processing in the U.S.”). This has been the case at last since the early
1990s. See Exchange Act Release No. 45644 (March 25, 2002) (“Since 1993, Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
(“ADP”) has distributed close to 100 percent of all proxies sent to beneficial owners holding shares in street
name.”).
2
Most brokers and banks deposit the shares with the Depository Trust Company and are registered in the name of
DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co. DTC, however, typically executes an omnibus proxy in advance of any meeting of
shareholders, transferring voting rights to participating brokers and banks. As a result, brokers and banks retain
voting rights under state law. See generally J. Robert Brown, Jr., The Shareholder Communication Rules and the

beneficial owners. 4 The NYSE mandates that brokers include in the materials either an executed
proxy card or a voting instruction form (VIF). 5 Brokers routinely provide the latter.
The VIF is prepared by the broker (or the broker’s intermediary) 6 and is expected to
generally duplicate the information contained in the proxy card. 7 The instructions are returned to
the broker and reflected on the proxy card provided to the issuer. 8 In the event street name
owners fail to return the VIF, brokers may vote the shares. The NYSE, however, limits the right
to vote uninstructed shares to “routine” matters. Routine matters exclude the election of
directors. 9
In meeting these obligations, brokers almost universally contract out the tasks to a single
intermediary, Broadridge. 10 Broadridge prepares the VIF, distributes the proxy materials, and
collects the voting instructions. 11 Broadridge also executes the proxy as attorney in fact on
behalf of brokers. 12
In uncontested solicitations, issuers and their agents can acquire from Broadridge
cumulative voting status information (i.e. voting instructions returned to date) through ICS
Online beginning the day after the first distribution of proxy materials. 13 The service provides

“real-time” access to voting results. 14 Broadridge imposes no obligations of confidentiality on
issuers with respect to this information. The decision to provide preliminary proxy results is
discretionary on the part of Broadridge. Disclosure of the information was designed to “help
issuers determine whether they have a quorum. . .” 15
Ten to 15 days before the meeting, Broadridge delivers to issuers an executed proxy card
as attorney in fact for each nominee that is a client. 16 Each day thereafter a supplemental vote is
provided to the issuer. 17 Two, and sometimes three, votes are issued on the day of the meeting. 18
In contested solicitations, Broadridge provides both sides a contest status report (CSR). 19
The CSR is distributed twice daily. The CSR is not an official vote but contains a spreadsheet
that shows the returns for all matters at the meeting. 20 Management and challengers both receive
identical information, including tallies returned for the other side’s candidates. 21 In these
solicitations, Broadridge as attorney in fact issues official votes for each nominee the day before
the meeting, with supplemental votes issued through the closing of the polls.
Exempt solicitations are those where a solicitor sends solicitation materials advocating a
position on a shareholder matter but does not distribute its own proxy card. Issuers receive
preliminary voting results in the same manner as an uncontested solicitation. As a result, they
can obtain real time access through ICS to the information beginning the day after their proxy
materials are distributed.

Until recently, exempt solicitors (those distributing proxy solicitation materials but not
distributing their own proxy card) received the vote status information on the matter or matters
subject to the solicitation. The information was provided as an aggregate total, not broken down
by nominee. In May 2013, however, Broadridge ceased providing vote status information upon
the request of the exempt solicitor. Instead, the information was only provided where authorized
by the relevant issuer and subjected to a three party confidentiality agreement (issuer, Broadridge
and exempt solicitor) with respect to the information. 22

B.

Impartiality

In general, brokers forwarding materials to street name owners are exempt from the
proxy rules. Rule 14a-2(a)(1) exempts the behavior so long as certain conditions are met. 23 To
qualify for the exemption, a broker cannot be paid a commission and must “promptly” furnish
the soliciting materials to the street name owners. In addition, a broker cannot do more than:
impartially instruct the person solicited to forward a proxy to the person, if any, to
whom the person solicited desires to give a proxy, or impartially request from the person
solicited instructions as to the authority to be conferred by the proxy and state that a
proxy will be given if no instructions are received by a certain date. 24
Examples of behavior not deemed impartial include the transmission of materials promptly for
one side and not the other, the selective distribution of proxy materials, and the transmission of
the broker’s “own literature” that “relates to the merits of the solicitation. . . ” 25 The examples
collectively prohibit a broker from engaging in behavior that benefits one side over the other in a
proxy solicitation.
The exemption, therefore, contemplates that brokers are exempt from the proxy rules or
otherwise not deemed participants where they play only a ministerial 26 and impartial 27 role in the
solicitation process. Moreover, with respect to voting instructions, Rule 14a-2(a)(1) expressly
limits brokers to “impartial[] request[s]”. The collection of instructions with an intent to use the
information in a partial manner would not qualify as an “impartial request.”

22

Although executed by three parties, the agreement imposes only on the exempt solicitor an obligation to “hold the
Vote Information confidential” and to disclose the information to agents only on a “need to know” basis. Public
statements “relating” to the information are prohibited.
23
The requirement has been in place since at least since 1952. See Exchange Act Release No. 4668 (1952).

See Exchange Act Release No. 7208 (Jan. 7, 1964) (“This exemption was based . . . ‘on the assumption that the
banker, broker or other person is acting in a ministerial capacity and is not making an independent solicitation from
the beneficial owner’”) (quoting Exchange Act Release No. 4668 (Jan. 31, 1952).

Concerns

Concerns have been raised over the lack of impartiality and the failure to act in a
ministerial fashion in connection with disclosure of voting results during an exempt solicitation.
In addition, concerns have arisen over possible conflicts of interest in connection with the
validation of voting results that could affect the obligation of impartiality.

1.

Concerns over the Lack of Impartiality

Selective Disclosure of Preliminary Voting Results. In contested solicitations, Broadridge
distributes preliminary voting results to issuers. Likewise, Broadridge distributes the same
information to challengers running a competing slate of directors. Neither the issuer nor the
challenger is subject to obligations of confidentiality with respect to the information.
In exempt solicitations (those distributing solicitation materials without soliciting a
proxy), Broadridge distributes preliminary voting results to the issuer and, until recently, to any
exempt solicitor who requested the information. 28 Exempt solicitors received results only with
respect to the matter subject to the solicitation. Disclosure to the exempt solicitor was informal
(sometimes in an email), provided as an aggregate total (not broken down by nominee), and
subject to periodic updates. 29 Neither the issuer nor the challenger was subject to obligations of
confidentiality with respect to the information.
In 2011, Broadridge altered existing practices by conditioning the disclosure of
preliminary results to exempt solicitors upon the execution of a two-party confidentiality
agreement. 30 The same restriction did not apply to issuers or to challengers in a contested
solicitation, i.e., to those that furnished a proxy card. As a result, exempt solicitors were
subjected to obligations that differed from issuers and other persons who solicited proxies.
In May 2013, Broadridge announced another change in practice following concerns
expressed by brokers. Broadridge determined that preliminary results would no longer be
provided upon request to any shareholder engaged in an exempt solicitation. 31 Instead, the
information would be provided only upon instructions from the issuer and only after the
execution of a three-party confidentiality agreement (among the issuer, Broadridge, and the

28

See Broadridge FAQs, supra note 17 (defining exempt solicitation as “those solicitations generally not involving
the solicitation of a proxy card or otherwise requiring the preparation of a proxy statement, such as a ‘just vote no’
campaign”).

issuer. Conference Call with Broadridge Officials, March 20, 2014.

exempt solicitor). 32 To date, only one issuer has instructed Broadridge to disclose preliminary
voting information to an exempt solicitor.33
In February 2014, Broadridge released to the media a statement indicating another
change in reporting procedures for preliminary voting results, this time in contested solicitations.
Under the reported change, Broadridge was to cease providing each side in a contest with the
voting results for the other side’s candidates. According to the press, Broadridge was “reversing
a long-standing policy of sharing information with both sides.” 34 The policy was not, however,
implemented. Broadridge has taken the position with the Subcommittee that the reported change
was communicated to the public in error.
Vote with Management Button. Concerns have also arisen with respect to the online
platforms used to facilitate the return of instructions by street name and other beneficial owners.
Broadridge had in the past included on its voting platforms a button that allowed investors to
“Vote with the Board’s Recommendations.” Rather than vote on each matter individually,
investors could simply select this option. Broadridge did not provide a button that would allow
owners to vote against the recommendations of the board, viewing the approach as impractical.
After receiving comments from the staff of the Commission, the button was removed
from at least one voting platform. 35 Broadridge informed clients that it was doing so after being
“informed of a new interpretive position taken” by the staff of the Commission that the button
could only be included if accompanied by a “Vote Against the Board’s Recommendation”
button. 36 Broadridge removed the option only from ProxyVote.com, the online voting platform
used by retail investors, and Mobile ProxyVote.
Observations. These matters illustrate that policies with respect to the collection of
voting instructions and the disclosure of preliminary voting information can be applied in a
manner that is not impartial. Moreover, the information has strategic value to both sides in an
exempt solicitation.37 They also illustrate that existing policies can be imposed for the
convenience of, or changed unilaterally following complaints by, particular participants or
intermediaries involved in the proxy process. The practices illustrate the need for guiding legal

Broadridge views the disclosure issue as a matter between the issuer and the third party and describes its role as
“facilitator.” Conference Call with Broadridge Officials, March 20, 2014. As a result, Broadridge indicated that it
would disclose the preliminary voting information to any person designated by the issuer, whether or not an exempt
solicitor. Id.

Possible Conflicts of Interest

In addition to collecting voting instructions and submitting proxies, Broadridge provides
services directly to issuers. 39 Moreover, some of these services are connected to the shareholder
voting process. These include serving as the tabulator 40 and the inspector of elections. 41
In addressing the Subcommittee, Broadridge indicated that it serves as tabulator for
approximately 1800 public companies. In approximately 15% of those cases, Broadridge also
indicated that it serves as inspector of elections. 42 In a number of cases, issuers describe
Broadridge as an “independent” inspector. 43 Broadridge represents that it does not serve as
tabulator or inspector in contested elections.

38

Concerns have also been raised about Broadridge’s policy of voting the blank portions of partially executed
proxies in a manner consistent with management’s recommendations. Letter from James McRitchie, Publisher,
Corp. Governance, to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Sec’y, SEC 2 (May 15, 2009), available

According to the Commission, the “vote tabulator is ultimately responsible for
determining that the correct number of votes has been submitted by each registered owner.” 44
Under Delaware law, inspectors are assigned the responsibility for, among other things,
determining the “validity of proxies and ballots,” counting “all votes and ballots,” and certifying
the “count of all votes and ballots.” 45
When serving as an Inspector and perhaps as tabulator, therefore, Broadridge is in a
position to determine the validity of proxies from the very same brokers and banks on whose
behalf Broadridge submitted proxies. In effect, Broadridge is in the position of examining its
own work. 46
IAC Recommendations:
Recommendation 1 47
That the staff of the Commission take the steps necessary to ensure that the exemption in
Rule 14a-2(a)(1) is conditioned upon the broker (and any intermediary designated by the broker)
acting in an impartial and ministerial fashion throughout the proxy process, including the
disclosure of preliminary voting information.
Rule 14a-2(a)(1) provides an exemption from the proxy rules for brokers that forward
materials to their street name owners. The exemption is premised on an obligation of brokers to
act in an impartial and ministerial fashion. In those circumstances, investors do not need the
protections of the proxy rules.
Currently, preliminary voting results are selectively disclosed in exempt solicitations.
Broadridge provides the information to issuers and only provides the information to exempt
solicitors if the issuer consents. Selective disclosure to one side in an exempt solicitation

at 10 (“An inspector of election then certifies the final meeting tally of the tabulator.”).
47
The members of the Investor as Owner Subcommittee unanimously supported this proposal; however, some
members of the subcommittee expressed concern regarding potential unintended consequences, particularly in light
of the shifting governance landscape. By way of example, one subcommittee member raised the possibility that in
today's climate of more shareholders running "hard" exempt (e.g., 14a-8) solicitations, disclosing preliminary voting
results to shareholder proponents could escalate what were historically ordinary shareholder proposals into mini
"proxy contests," perhaps beyond the original intent of 14a-8 and potentially straining corporate resources and
occupying managements' time and attention to the detriment of shareholders. The subcommittee member was not
proposing to address this or any other potential unintended consequence by opposing the disclosure of preliminary
voting results to shareholder proponents. Rather, the subcommittee member would encourage the Commission to
consider the recommendations and the potential for unintended consequences in the broader context of proxy
plumbing.

provides advantages. The information can influence strategy and effect the allocation of
resources. 48
Even where disclosure may occur, exempt solicitors are subject to restrictions not
imposed on issuers. Disclosure to issuers in uncontested solicitations is not conditioned upon an
obligation of confidentiality. Exempt solicitors are, however, subject to such an obligation. As a
result, issuers can engage in their own “selective” disclosure in order to potentially influence
voting. This can include public disclosure or disclosure to particular investors or other
participants in the solicitation. 49
The obligation of “impartiality” set out in the Rule expressly applies to any “request” for
voting instructions. Although Rule 14a-2(a)(1) does not expressly reference the disclosure of
preliminary voting results, the logic of the exemption dictates that disclosure of the information
be subjected to an obligation of impartiality.
First, the entire exemption is based upon the passive and impartial role played by brokers
(and their intermediaries) in the solicitation process. Brokers are given an exemption from the
proxy rules because their actions do not raise investor concerns. To the extent that they fail to
act in an impartial and ministerial manner and engage in activities that benefit only one side in a
solicitation, an exemption from the proxy rules is no longer appropriate. In those circumstances,
investors need the protections of the proxy rules, including the prohibition on false and
misleading statements contained in Rule 14a-9. 50
Second, Rule 14a-2(a) specifically provides that brokers may only “impartially request
from the person solicited instructions as to the authority to be conferred by the proxy and state
that a proxy. . .” To the extent that a broker collecting instructions intends to use the information
to favor one side over another in a solicitation (whether an exempt solicitation or a contested
solicitation), the “request” cannot be viewed as impartial. At a minimum, street name owners
would need to know that this would occur and would presumably need to be given the right to

preliminary voting information circulated by Broadridge incorrectly (although through no fault of Broadridge)
reported votes for treasury shares held by the company. To the extent that anti-fraud provisions in the proxy rules
were applicable to the preliminary voting information, an obligation to ensure that the information was complete and
accurate could be applicable in certain circumstances.

object to the disclosure of their preliminary voting information on a selective basis. 51 Moreover,
awareness could affect the decision to vote or the timing of a beneficial owner’s voting
decision. 52
The failure to act in an impartial manner with respect to the disclosure of preliminary
voting results cannot be justified based upon a need for confidentiality. 53 Voting instructions
entail an exchange of information between brokers (or their designated intermediary) and street
name or other account holders. They do not, therefore, implicate any confidentiality rights of
issuers. With respect to the privacy of brokers and beneficial owners, Broadridge discloses
voting tallies in exempt solicitations only in an aggregate form. The information does not,
therefore, identify the relevant broker or include personally identifiable information of beneficial
owners. 54
The alleged need for confidentiality is also inconsistent with the actual practices of
Broadridge in other circumstances. Issuers receiving preliminary voting results are not subject to
confidentiality obligations. In contested solicitations, Broadridge discloses to challengers the
tallies received by issuers and to issuers the tallies received by challengers. Broadridge,
therefore, does not treat responses to the issuer or challengers as confidential in these
circumstances. 55
51

This is analogous to the rights of beneficial owners in the shareholder communication rules. See Rule 14b-1(b),
17 CFR 240.14b-1(b) (brokers may disclose the identity of beneficial owners “who have not objected to disclosure
of such information”).
52
The staff has taken the position that “impartiality” applies only to the forwarding See Letter from Keith L.
Higgins, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, SEC, to Jeff Mahoney, General Counsel, CII, June 25, 2014
(“The staff believes that the rule’s impartiality requirement is intended to govern only the way that brokers instruct
solicited persons to forward a proxy or request from the solicited persons their voting instructions.”), available at
http://www.cii.org/files/issues_and_advocacy/correspondence/2014/06_25_14_SEC_response.PDF Thus, extending
the requirement of impartiality to “disclosure of preliminary voting information” would require rulemaking. The
position taken by the staff did not, however, discuss whether brokers have a duty at the time of the solicitation of
instructions to inform shareholders about the possibility of selective disclosure and obtain from those shareholders a
right to object to the disclosure of the information. The position taken by the staff likewise did not discuss whether,
to the extent disclosure was not subject to the exemption, the act was, as a result, subject to the requirements of the
proxy rules.
53
Broadridge has indicated that it ceased disclosing information to third parties in exempt solicitations “after
learning that the confidentiality of this information was of concern to its broker-dealer and bank clients and because
the provision of interim voting reports is not otherwise required by any applicable regulatory obligation.”
Broadridge FAQs, supra note 17.
54
At the time the Commission proposed to require the disclosure of “preliminary voting results,” a number of
commentators objected. None of them appear to have based their opposition on the need for confidentiality. See
Exchange Act Release No. 61175 (Dec. 16, 2009) (noting concerns that disclosure of preliminary voting results
“could mislead investors if the definitive results reflect a different outcome than what was disclosed initially” and
could “inadvertently influence voting if the disclosure is made at a time when the opportunity remains open for
additional votes to be cast”).
55
Brokers (and their intermediaries) have also effectively waived any confidentiality concerns. The rules of the
NYSE compensate brokers for the disclosure of preliminary voting results. Exchange Act Release No. 41177
(March 16, 1999) (nominee coordination fee provides compensation for, among other things, the “tabulation and
dissemination of preliminary voting information”). The acceptance of the fees, therefore, amounts to an
acknowledgement that preliminary voting information will be disclosed. This can be seen from the decision to
selectively disclose preliminary voting results to issuers without any accompanying obligation to maintain the
confidentiality of the information.

10

To the extent any residual concern over confidentiality exists, they do not justify the
selective disclosure of preliminary voting results to issuers. Instead, impartiality and any need
for confidentiality can be addressed by requiring disclosure to all persons undertaking a
solicitation and conditioning disclosure on the execution of a confidentiality agreement. 56
Alternatively, impartiality can be guaranteed by denying access to preliminary voting results for
all persons distributing solicitation materials or by requiring public disclosure of the information.
The staff of the Commission should, as has been requested, provide “clear rules of the
road” specifying that the obligation of impartiality in Rule 14a-2(a) extends not only to the
distribution of proxy materials and the request for voting instructions, but also to the disclosure
of preliminary voting information.
57

Doing so would not only ensure a basic fairness with respect to the proxy process but
would also promote the integrity of the voting process. Disclosure of preliminary voting
information can provide a mechanism to help ensure the accuracy of the tabulation process. 58 In
at least one example provided to the Subcommittee, an investor conducting an exempt
solicitation raised with the SEC “substantial and difficult to explain discrepancies between
preliminary and final vote tallies” in a contested election for directors. 59 The company
subsequently filed an amended report containing updated tallies that were less favorable to the
elected directors. 60
The staff should specifically state that the obligation to solicit instructions on an
impartial basis does not allow brokers (or their intermediaries) to do so with the awareness or
expectation that the voting information will be provided to only to one side in a contested or
exempt solicitation. Impartiality could be met through the denial of such information to all
parties in a contested or exempt solicitation. The Subcommittee believes, however, that the staff
should express a preference for disclosure on identical terms to all parties who distribute proxy
materials.
56

Any such confidentiality agreement should treat all parties equally, including both restrictions on disclosure and
rights to enforcement.

Letter from Senator Schumer to Chair Mary Jo White, May 23, 2013, available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2013-07/nyse201307-32.pdf (calling for the Commission “to take any
necessary action to ensure that proxy services providers such as Broadridge have clear rules of the road with respect
to the dissemination of voting tallies and other material disclosures in connection with proxy solicitations.”).
58
To the extent that preliminary and final results differ in any significant manner, they may illustrate problems in
the collection or tabulation of voting instructions. In Red Oak Fund, LP v. Digirad Corp., CA No. 8559-VCN (Del.
Ch. Oct. 23, 2013), the final vote totals differed from preliminary voting data because of the erroneous inclusion of
treasury shares. In 2009, a significant error was made with respect to the tabulation of voting instructions with
respect to the election of directors at Yahoo. Published reports indicated that the matter came to the attention of
Broadridge after a large shareholder suggested that the tallies did not include his results. See Kara Swisher,
Broadridge to Yahoo: Oops, We Added Wrong (and Shareholders Like you Lots Less)!, August 5, 2008, available
at http://allthingsd.com/20080805/broadridge-to-yahoo-oops-we-added-wrong-and-shareholders-like-you-lots-less/

A copy of the letter was distributed at a meeting of the SubCommittee held on July 10, 2014.
60
In the original report, for example, one director was shown has having 37,772,632 votes for and 30,453,413
against. In the amended report, these tallies were changed to 36,864,752 for and 33,360,699 against. See Current

Recommendation 2
That the staff of the Commission take the position that any broker relying on the
exemption from the proxy rules in Rule 14a-2(a)(1) that uses an intermediary to fulfill the
requirements of impartiality under Rule 14a-2(a)(1) take reasonable steps to verify, based upon
all the relevant facts and circumstances, that the intermediary will act in an impartial fashion
and is not subject to impermissible conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the intermediary
to act in an impartial manner.
Brokers seeking to remain exempt from the proxy rules during a solicitation have an
obligation to act in an impartial manner. Brokers collectively rely on a single intermediary to
forward proxy materials to street name owners, collect voting instructions, and disclose
preliminary results. As an agent, the intermediary is subject to the same obligations of
impartiality imposed on brokers. In order to ensure that this obligation is met, the staff should
clarify that brokers must take reasonable steps to ensure that the designated intermediary will act
in an impartial fashion.
Steps taken by the brokers should include consideration of any conflicts of interest by the
intermediary that may impair impartiality. Conflicts can arise where the intermediary has a
business relationship with an issuer soliciting proxies. Conflicts can also arise where the
intermediary is paid by the issuer to tabulate and certify proxies, including proxies submitted by
the intermediary.
Brokers can presumably fulfill these responsibilities on a case-by-case basis. In addition,
the staff should consider whether brokers can address the issue through a “thorough review” of
the intermediary’s “conflict procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation . . .” 61
Appropriate procedures and policies can include firewalls that separate relevant functions and
prevent specified employees “from obtaining access to information about the firm's business
relationships with Issuers” and “insulate those persons from direct or indirect influence by the
firm's employees who know of those relationships.” 62

voting recommendations from obtaining access to information about the firm's business relationships with Issuers
and (b) insulate those persons from direct or indirect influence by the firm's employees who know of those
relationships.”).
