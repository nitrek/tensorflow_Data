ORDER OF SUSPENSION
OF TRADING

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of Infinex Ventures, Inc. (CIK No. 0001076310)
(“Infinex”) because of questions regarding the accuracy of statements in Infinex reports posted
on the OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. and in company press releases. This
includes concerns that, between May 5 and September 17, 2014, Infinex appears to have made
false and misleading statements concerning its operations and financial condition, its acquisition
of Marijuana Funding, Inc., and its rights to financing to develop a marijuana business. Since
that time, Infinex does not appear to have made any information publicly available about itself.
Infinex is a Nevada corporation whose corporate status is listed as revoked by the Nevada
Secretary of State. Its principal place of business is in Denver, Colorado. Infinex’s stock is
quoted on OTC Link, under the ticker symbol INFX.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange

Act of 1934, that trading of the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on September 30, 2016 through 11:59 p.m. EDT on October 13,
2016.
By the Commission.

Secretary
