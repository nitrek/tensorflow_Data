NOTICE OF PROPOSED PLAN FOR

FUND AND OPPORTUNITY FOR
COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, that Putnam
Investment Management, LLC has filed with the Commission its proposed plan for the
distribution of monies placed into a Fair Fund authorized by the Commission, pursuant to
Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (“Distribution Plan”), in the matter of Putnam
Investment Management, LLC (“Putnam”). The Commission issued an Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease and Desist Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order in this matter on March 23, 2005 (Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 Release No. 2370, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 26788) (the
“Order”).

OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT

Pursuant to this Notice, all interested parties are advised that the Distribution Plan may be
obtained by submitting a written request to Ari S. Gabinet, District Administrator, Philadelphia
District Office, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 701 Market Street, Suite
2000, Philadelphia, PA 19106. Further, all persons desiring to comment on the Distribution Plan
may submit their views, in writing, no later than June 20, 2005, to the Office of the Secretary,
United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20549-0609.
THE PROPOSED PLAN OF DISGORGEMENT
The Distribution Plan generally provides for distribution “fairly and proportionately to
the Putnam Funds the total disgorgement and penalty ordered in [the Order] based upon the
amounts of brokerage commissions in 2000 through 2003 categorized for ‘Fund Sales’ attributed
to each Putnam Fund.” The Putnam Funds are the registered investment companies for which
Putnam is the investment adviser, including the retail mutual funds, registered closed-end funds,
and open-end mutual funds that underlie variable annuities. The proposed plan provides that
each Putnam Fund shall receive a proportionate share of the funds paid by Putnam comprised of
$1 (one dollar) in disgorgement and a civil money penalty of $40 million (forty million dollars).

For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
