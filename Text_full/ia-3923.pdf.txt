security, directly or indirectly, unlawfully, feloniously, and willfully made an untrue statement of
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

At the time of the misconduct for which he was convicted, Russell was
associated with an investment adviser registered with the Commission.

What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against
Respondent pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.

IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the

engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
2

proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as
