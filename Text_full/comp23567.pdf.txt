COMPLAINT
Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) alleges as follows:
NATURE OF ACTION
1.

The SEC brings this action to halt an ongoing fraudulent and unregistered

securities offering being perpetrated by Defendants Providence Financial Investments, Inc.
(“Providence Financial”) and Providence Fixed Income Fund, LLC (“Providence Fund”).
Since at least as early as 2011, Providence Financial and Providence Fund have raised
more than $64 million from over 400 investors throughout the United States.
2.

The securities at issue are promissory notes that purport to pay annual

returns generally ranging from 12% to 13%. Providence Financial and Providence Fund
represented to investors that their investment proceeds would be used to fund the
“factoring” of accounts receivable in Brazil. Contrary to these representations,

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 2 of 18

Providence Financial and Providence Fund spent, at best, less than 68% of their
investors’ money to finance Brazil factoring transactions, and both companies have been
unable to account for how they spent the remaining investor proceeds. One use of
investor funds that was not disclosed to investors was the generous 6% annual
commission that Providence Financial and Providence Fund paid to their unregistered
brokers for selling the promissory notes. Another undisclosed use of funds was the
payment of millions of dollars to Providence Financial and Providence Fund insiders.
3.

In addition to misrepresenting how they would use investor funds,

Providence Financial and Providence Fund have concealed from investors that the
companies face serious financial difficulties. Providence Financial and Providence Fund
hold very little cash or liquid assets, and the amount of money owed to investors vastly
exceeds the value of any Brazilian receivables investments held by Providence Financial
and Providence Fund. Compounding these problems is a highly unfavorable foreign
exchange rate which hinders the repatriation of Brazilian assets to repay U.S investors.
As a result, the only way Providence Financial and Providence Fund are repaying their
current investors is through the proceeds of new investments.
4.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund have failed to disclose any of

this negative financial information to their investors. Instead, Providence Financial and
Providence Fund tout the notes as a safe and relatively low risk investment.
5.

To lure investors, Providence Financial and Providence Fund employ a

team of unregistered brokers throughout the United States, and pay them the
aforementioned 6% annual commission for each successful promissory note sale. One
2

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 3 of 18

such unregistered broker is Defendant Jeffory Churchfield, a Forest Lake financial
advisor who promoted the promissory notes to his Minnesota clients. Another is
Defendant Jack Jarrell, an investment adviser registered with the State of Washington,
who assisted Churchfield in promoting the promissory notes to his Minnesota clients.
6.

In the course of the SEC’s investigation, Providence Financial and

Providence Fund have been unable to answer basic questions about their organizational
structure, their use of investor proceeds, and their current financial condition. These
defendants have failed to produce audited or consolidated financial statements, up-to-date
financial information, or a current inventory of their purported factoring investments.
7.

When the SEC sought to learn more information on these subjects by

compelling the testimony of Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s CEO, the
CEO asserted his 5th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
8.

While the SEC continues to investigate the promissory note offerings, it

brings this action now to stop the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered securities
through unregistered brokers. In addition to seeking temporary and preliminary relief to
halt the ongoing offering and preserve investor funds, including the appointment of a
receiver, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against the defendants to enjoin them
from future violations of the federal securities laws specified below. The SEC further
seeks an order requiring the defendants to pay civil penalties and disgorgement, plus
prejudgment interest, on all ill-gotten gains they received.

13.

Providence Financial Investments, Inc. is a Delaware corporation

headquartered in Miami, Florida. Providence Financial offers and sells unregistered
4

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 5 of 18

promissory notes to investors throughout the United States and purports to use the
proceeds of those notes to finance transactions in the Brazilian receivables factoring
market. Since at least 2011, Providence Financial, together with Providence Fund, has
raised at least $64 million through the sale of unregistered promissory notes.
14.

Providence Fixed Income Fund, LLC is a Delaware corporation

headquartered in Miami, Florida. Providence Fund offers and sells unregistered
promissory notes to investors throughout the United States and purports to use the
proceeds of those notes to finance transactions in the Brazilian receivables factoring
market. Both Providence Financial and Providence Fund are members of the Providence
Companies Group (“Providence Group”). Providence Group purports to be a diversified
group of companies, under common ownership by the same principals, with over 30
years of experience in financial services, receivable financing, and trade in Brazil, China,
and other emerging markets.
15.

Jeffory Churchfield is a resident of Forest Lake, Minnesota. Churchfield

operates a financial advisory business that purports to assist individuals in optimizing and
protecting retirement income. Churchfield has offered and sold Providence Financial and
Providence Fund promissory notes to his clients since 2013. Churchfield is not registered
as or affiliated with a registered broker-dealer.
16.

Jack Jarrell is a resident of Snohomish, Washington. Jarrell is registered

with the State of Washington as an investment adviser and has been offering and selling
Providence Financial and Providence Fund promissory notes to investors since at least

5

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 6 of 18

2012. Jarrell is not registered as a broker-dealer nor is he affiliated with a registered
broker-dealer.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
I.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund Offer and Sell Unregistered
Securities through Unregistered Brokers.
17.

From at least as early as 2011, Providence Financial and Providence Fund

have been issuing, offering to sell, and selling fixed rate promissory notes to investors in
the United States and elsewhere.
18.

Generally, the notes pay annual interest rates of 12% to 13%. Investors

generally have the option of purchasing a note with a one-year term at or slightly less
than 12%, or purchasing a note with a longer term at a higher interest rate. Providence
Financial and Providence Fund allow investors to elect to receive monthly or quarterly
cash interest payments or take a one-time payment of interest, at a higher rate, upon
maturity.
19.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund purport to use the proceeds of

those notes to generate profits via investment in receivables transactions –a practice they
refer to as “factoring” – made through certain affiliated companies in Brazil. At least 400
U.S. investors currently hold at least $64 million in notes issued by Providence Financial
and Providence Fund.
20.

The notes issued by Providence Financial and Providence Fund are securities,

as that term is defined in the federal securities laws.

6

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 7 of 18

21.

No registration statement has been filed with the SEC concerning the notes

sold by Providence Financial or Providence Fund to investors in the United States.
22.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund have offered and sold the

unregistered notes through a network of unregistered brokers, including Defendants
Churchfield and Jarrell.
23.

Churchfield, Jarrell, and other unregistered brokers have offered and sold

Providence Financial and Providence Fund notes pursuant to agreements with a related
Providence Group company that pay the brokers an annual commission in the amount of
6% of the face value of each note sold.
24.

Jarrell began selling the promissory notes in March 2012, and has offered and

sold the notes to investors with whom Jarrell had an investment advisory agreement in
place.
25.

In 2015, Providence Financial and Providence Fund paid Jarrell

approximately $260,000 in commissions on the sale of the promissory notes. In addition,
Providence Financial and Providence Fund have paid for half of Jarrell’s office rent since
Jarrell began selling the promissory notes to his clients. Jarrell did not disclose this
compensation to any of the investors to whom he sold Providence notes, including the
individuals with whom he had advisory agreements in place.
26.

Churchfield began offering and selling Providence Fund and Providence

Financial promissory notes in 2013. At Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s
direction, Jarrell provided guidance, training, and assistance to Churchfield on how to
offer and sell the promissory notes. In addition to the 6% commission paid to
7

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 8 of 18

Churchfield, Providence Fund and Providence Financial paid Jarrell a 3% annual
“override” commission on the face value of notes sold by Churchfield. Accordingly, 9%
of the proceeds of the investments sold by Churchfield would be devoted, annually, to
commissions for Churchfield and Jarrell.
27.

In 2015, Providence Financial and Providence Fund paid Churchfield

approximately $130,000 in commissions on the sale of the promissory notes, which
represented Churchfield’s sole source of income for that year. In addition, Providence
Financial and Providence Fund have paid for all of Churchfield’s office rent since he
began offering the promissory notes.
28.

Jarrell and Churchfield identified potential investors for the promissory

notes by, among other things, holding “social security seminars.” In the course of selling
notes to investors, both Jarrell and Churchfield explained the investment to potential
investors using documents provided to them by Providence Financial and Providence
Fund. They met with and answered questions from investors and potential investors,
accepted application materials, forwarded signed applications and promissory notes to
Providence Financial and Providence Fund, and transferred investor funds to and from
Providence Financial and Providence Fund.
29.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund offered higher interest rates to

noteholders that did not take monthly or quarterly interest payments in cash, but instead
allowed interest to accrue until their notes matured. The majority of investors chose not
to take monthly or quarterly cash interest payments, but instead opted to allow interest to
accrue until the notes reached maturity.
8

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 9 of 18

30.

When their notes matured, many investors did not take repayment of their

principal and payment of accrued interest in cash. Instead, they “renewed” their notes by
transferring the principal and any accrued interest on their mature notes into new notes.
Both Jarrell and Churchfield walked their clients through the note renewal process,
collecting client signatures on new notes and other documents and forwarding those
documents to Providence Financial and Providence Fund.
31.

At some point in 2015, Providence Financial and Providence Fund began

sending Jarrell and other unregistered brokers an “Accredited Applicant Questionnaire”
along with other documents used in the note renewal process. However, Jarrell never
used this questionnaire with his clients. Moreover, numerous promissory note investors
were not “accredited” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws.
II.

The Promissory Note Offering Materials Contain Material
Misrepresentations and Omissions.
32.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund gave investors only a limited

amount of information about the notes or their purported factoring business in Brazil.
That information initially took the form of a Providence Fund “Executive Memorandum,”
which Providence Fund and Providence Financial provided to investors and the
unregistered brokers who promoted the promissory notes.
33.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund later provided investors and

brokers a document entitled “Providence Financial Investments Inc. High Yield Fixed
Returns Information” (the “Information Memorandum”).

9

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 10 of 18

34.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund additionally promoted, and

continue to promote, the promissory notes on a public website: www.provfinance.com.
35.

Neither the Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum, the

website, nor any of the other materials that Providence Financial and Providence Fund
provided to investors included financial statements or balance sheets related to
Providence Financial, Providence Fund, or any of their affiliates. Indeed, when requested
by Churchfield to provide such information, Providence Financial and Providence Fund
refused, telling Churchfield: “we are not a public company and don’t disclose this.”
36.

The Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum, and the website

provide a general description, and tout the profitability, of the receivables financing
business that Providence Financial and Providence Fund purport to conduct in the
Brazilian factoring market. These offering materials describe factoring as a financial
transaction whereby a business sells its accounts receivable to a third party (the factor) at
a discount, and the factor obtains the rights associated with the receivables. In theory, the
factor makes money via the spread between the discounted purchase price of the
receivables and the supposedly larger amount the factor collects when the outstanding
receivables are paid off.
37.

The Executive Memorandum describes the promissory notes, and states that

Providence Fund will pay noteholders 12% annual interest, with payments to be made
monthly. The Executive Memorandum indicates that note proceeds will be used, solely,
to finance receivables factoring in Brazil. The Executive Memorandum additionally
describes the promissory notes as a “low to moderate risk” investment.
10

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 11 of 18

38.

Similar to the Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum

contains a general discussion of receivables financing and factoring in Brazil, but
provides scant details about Providence Financial’s or Providence Fund’s operations or
how those companies will use investor funds to engage in factoring transactions.
39.

The Information Memorandum additionally states that one of Providence

Financial’s main philosophies is to: “Provide investment safety with real high yield
returns.” The Information Memorandum additionally represents, in a section titled
“Charges”: “There are no fixed charges to clients.”
40.

The website similarly states, in a section titled “Charges”: “No fees or

charges to our lenders [the promissory note holders].”
41.

The Executive Memorandum, the Information Memorandum, and website

each fail to disclose any use for the note proceeds other than investing in factoring
transactions in Brazil. For instance, none of the offering materials provided to investors
disclosed that Providence Financial and Providence Fund would pay 6% annual
commissions on each promissory note sold. The offering materials additionally do not
disclose that, from 2011 to 2015, a small set of Providence Group executives have
received nearly $9 million from Providence Group’s U.S. entities.
42.

These offering materials also do not disclose information describing the

current financial condition, the current assets and liabilities, or the ability to repay
investors, of Providence Financial, Providence Fund, or their related entities. Moreover,
beyond general statements downplaying the risks of the investment, the offering materials

11

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 12 of 18

contain little, if any, disclosures about the risks attendant to receivables factoring,
generally, or the promissory notes, in particular.
III.

Providence Financial and Providence Fund Face Serious Financial Problems.
43.

Contrary to their representation that the “sole” use of investor proceeds

would be to fund Brazilian factoring transactions, Providence Financial and Providence
Fund deployed at least 32% of investor proceeds on expenditures other than receivables
factoring.
44.

One result of Providence Financial and Providence Fund expending large

portions of investor proceeds for uses other than factoring is that they hold receivables
investments that are significantly lower in value than their obligations to investors. For
example, at year-end 2014, Providence Financial and Providence Fund owed investors
more than $52 million, yet their Brazilian affiliates held only $13 million in receivables
assets. For 2015, Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s obligations to U.S.
investors had increased to $64 million, yet their receivables investments had dwindled to
$10.6 million.
45.

Moreover, Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s Brazilian affiliates

have faced difficulties collecting certain of their accounts receivable.
46.

Providence Financial’s and Providence Fund’s current financial situation

appears extremely tenuous. Based on the most current bank statements available,
Providence Financial and Providence Fund hold less than $250,000, spread through 28
accounts.

12

CASE 0:16-cv-01877 Document 1 Filed 06/07/16 Page 13 of 18

47.

Compounding these problems, Brazil’s currency has sharply devalued against

the U.S. dollar, with a nearly 50% decline in 2015. As a result, Providence Financial and
Providence Fund cannot repatriate their Brazilian assets to repay the U.S. investors
without suffering significant currency exchange losses. Accordingly, the only way
Providence Financial and Providence Fund are able to repay U.S. investors is through the
proceeds of new investments.
48.

Nevertheless, Providence Financial and Providence Fund continue to offer

the promissory notes to U.S. investors, and do so without disclosing any of the financial
concerns described above.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTORNEYS COMPLETING CIVIL COVER SHEET FORM JS 44
Authority For Civil Cover Sheet
The JS 44 civil cover sheet and the information contained herein neither replaces nor supplements the filings and service of pleading or other papers as
required by law, except as provided by local rules of court. This form, approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States in September 1974, is
required for the use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil docket sheet. Consequently, a civil cover sheet is submitted to the Clerk of
Court for each civil complaint filed. The attorney filing a case should complete the form as follows:
I.(a)

(b)

(c)

Plaintiffs-Defendants. Enter names (last, first, middle initial) of plaintiff and defendant. If the plaintiff or defendant is a government agency, use
only the full name or standard abbreviations. If the plaintiff or defendant is an official within a government agency, identify first the agency and
then the official, giving both name and title.
County of Residence. For each civil case filed, except U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county where the first listed plaintiff resides at the
time of filing. In U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county in which the first listed defendant resides at the time of filing. (NOTE: In land
condemnation cases, the county of residence of the "defendant" is the location of the tract of land involved.)
Attorneys. Enter the firm name, address, telephone number, and attorney of record. If there are several attorneys, list them on an attachment, noting
in this section "(see attachment)".

II.

Jurisdiction. The basis of jurisdiction is set forth under Rule 8(a), F.R.Cv.P., which requires that jurisdictions be shown in pleadings. Place an "X"
in one of the boxes. If there is more than one basis of jurisdiction, precedence is given in the order shown below.
United States plaintiff. (1) Jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. 1345 and 1348. Suits by agencies and officers of the United States are included here.
United States defendant. (2) When the plaintiff is suing the United States, its officers or agencies, place an "X" in this box.
Federal question. (3) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1331, where jurisdiction arises under the Constitution of the United States, an amendment
to the Constitution, an act of Congress or a treaty of the United States. In cases where the U.S. is a party, the U.S. plaintiff or defendant code takes
precedence, and box 1 or 2 should be marked.
Diversity of citizenship. (4) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1332, where parties are citizens of different states. When Box 4 is checked, the
citizenship of the different parties must be checked. (See Section III below; NOTE: federal question actions take precedence over diversity
cases.)

III.

Residence (citizenship) of Principal Parties. This section of the JS 44 is to be completed if diversity of citizenship was indicated above. Mark this
section for each principal party.

IV.

Nature of Suit. Place an "X" in the appropriate box. If the nature of suit cannot be determined, be sure the cause of action, in Section VI below, is
sufficient to enable the deputy clerk or the statistical clerk(s) in the Administrative Office to determine the nature of suit. If the cause fits more than
one nature of suit, select the most definitive.

V.

Origin. Place an "X" in one of the six boxes.
Original Proceedings. (1) Cases which originate in the United States district courts.
Removed from State Court. (2) Proceedings initiated in state courts may be removed to the district courts under Title 28 U.S.C., Section 1441.
When the petition for removal is granted, check this box.
Remanded from Appellate Court. (3) Check this box for cases remanded to the district court for further action. Use the date of remand as the filing
date.
Reinstated or Reopened. (4) Check this box for cases reinstated or reopened in the district court. Use the reopening date as the filing date.
Transferred from Another District. (5) For cases transferred under Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1404(a). Do not use this for within district transfers or
multidistrict litigation transfers.
Multidistrict Litigation. (6) Check this box when a multidistrict case is transferred into the district under authority of Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1407.
When this box is checked, do not check (5) above.

VI.

Cause of Action. Report the civil statute directly related to the cause of action and give a brief description of the cause. Do not cite jurisdictional
statutes unless diversity. Example: U.S. Civil Statute: 47 USC 553 Brief Description: Unauthorized reception of cable service

VII.

Requested in Complaint. Class Action. Place an "X" in this box if you are filing a class action under Rule 23, F.R.Cv.P.
Demand. In this space enter the actual dollar amount being demanded or indicate other demand, such as a preliminary injunction.
Jury Demand. Check the appropriate box to indicate whether or not a jury is being demanded.

VIII. Related Cases. This section of the JS 44 is used to reference related pending cases, if any. If there are related pending cases, insert the docket
numbers and the corresponding judge names for such cases.
Date and Attorney Signature. Date and sign the civil cover sheet.
