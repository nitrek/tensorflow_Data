POSTPONEMENT ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP), pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act), on April 6, 2016, and the hearing was scheduled to commence on April 25, 2016.
The OIP alleges that each Respondent is a corporation with a class of securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and has repeatedly failed to file
required periodic reports. The Division of Enforcement is seeking to revoke the registrations of
Respondents’ securities.
The OIP provides that each Respondent’s Answer is due within ten days of service of the
OIP on it. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). A Respondent that fails to file an Answer
within the time provided will be deemed to be in default, and the undersigned will enter an order
revoking the registration of its securities. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). To
allow time for Answers, the hearing will be postponed sine die, and a prehearing conference will
be held by telephone on a date and time to be announced.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
