RAHFCO MANAGEMENT GROUP, LLC :

ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings on January 13, 2016, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The
proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Hansen, No. 1:13-cv-1403 (S.D.N.Y.
Dec. 21, 2015), appeal dismissed, No. 16-74 (2d Cir. Mar. 16, 2016), in which Respondent
RAHFCO Management Group, LLC, was enjoined against violations of the antifraud and
registration provisions of the federal securities statutes. Randal Hansen, a partner of RAHFCO,
has appeared on its behalf in this proceeding. A prehearing conference was held on March 29,
2016, at which the Division of Enforcement advised that it was seeking associational bars against
RAHFCO, and both parties agreed that RAHFCO is defunct. Tr. 29-30.
At the prehearing conference the Division advised that it had taken steps to provide its
complete investigative file to Hansen, who is incarcerated at Duluth FPC,1 in compliance with 17
C.F.R. § 201.230 (Rule 230)2 and the Commission’s rulings in Byron S. Rainner, Exchange Act
Release No. 59040, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2840, at *4-7 (Dec. 2, 2008), and José P. Zollino, Exchange
Act Release No. 51632, 2005 SEC LEXIS 987, at *7-10 (Apr. 29, 2005). Hansen confirmed that
the file, contained on a thumb drive, had arrived at Duluth FPC, and he expected to receive it
shortly. RAHFCO Mgmt. Grp., LLC, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3744 (A.L.J. Mar. 29,
2016). Based on the foregoing and on the assumption that Hansen would have “a reasonable
amount of time to review the investigative file before being required to file any pleadings,” the
undersigned granted the Division leave, pursuant to Rule 250, to file a motion for summary

Commission Rules applicable to administrative proceedings such as this one are available on
the Commission’s public website at http://www.sec.gov/about/rulesprac2006.pdf.

disposition, due May 2, 2016, with RAHFCO’s opposition and the Division’s reply due June 13
and 24, 2016, respectively. Id.; see also Byron S. Rainner, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2840, at *7; José P.
Zollino, 2005 SEC LEXIS 987, at *10; 17 C.F.R. § 201.250.
Hansen has advised in recent correspondence that he was finally able to access the file on
May 11, that he is allowed one hour a day to review the file, and that the guard who oversees his
review of the file was on vacation for several days. As of May 20, 2016, a second thumb drive
containing an index of the documents in the file had arrived, but Hansen did not yet know
whether and when he would have access to it.
In light of the above, and consistent with Rule 161 and with the Commission’s rulings in
the Rainner and Zollino cases, at this time, the due date for the opposition will be postponed to
July 15, 2016, and for the Division’s reply to July 22, 2016.
It must be stressed that Hansen must have “a reasonable amount of time to review the
investigative file before being required to file any pleadings.” Byron S. Rainner, 2008 SEC
LEXIS 2840, at *7; José P. Zollino, 2005 SEC LEXIS 987, at *10. In light of the conditions
imposed on Hansen’s ability to review the file, it is unlikely that he will have “a reasonable amount
of time” to do so in the foreseeable future. It is also noted, with reference to the so-called Steadman
factors3 that must be considered in determining sanctions, the fact that RAHFCO is defunct means
that “the likelihood that [its] occupation will present opportunities for future violations” is nil. The
Division may wish to seek dismissal of the proceeding.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

In determining sanctions, the Commission considers such factors as:
the egregiousness of the [respondent’s] actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of
the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the [respondent’s]
assurances against future violations, the [respondent’s] recognition of the
wrongful nature of his conduct, and the likelihood that the [respondent’s]
occupation will present opportunities for future violations.

Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)).
