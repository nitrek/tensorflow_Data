In the Matter of
STEPHEN STUART

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
Stephen Stuart seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated January 26, 2015 (the
"Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Order barred Stuart from "participating in any offering of a penny stock, including:
acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a
broker, dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or
attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. . . ." It did not, however, bar him
from association with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor. Accordingly, Stephen Stuart's request
to vacate NRSRO and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
