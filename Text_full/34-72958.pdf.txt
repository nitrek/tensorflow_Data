ACT OF 1934 AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
JESSE C. LITVAK,
Respondent.

I.

public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to

RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

2.
On March 7, 2014, a jury returned a verdict of guilty against Respondent on
ten counts of securities fraud (15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78ff), one count of Troubled Asset Relief
Program (TARP) fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1031), and four counts of making false statements to the
government (18 U.S.C. § 1001) before the United States District Court for the District of
Connecticut, in United States v. Jesse C. Litvak, Case No. 3:13-cr-00019-JCH. On July 25, 2014,
the Court entered the judgment based on the guilty verdict. Litvak was sentenced to a prison term
of 24 months followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay a fine of $1,750,000
and restitution in an amount to be ordered.
3.
The counts of the criminal indictment as to which the jury found Litvak
guilty alleged, among other things, that Litvak was a trader of residential mortgaged-backed
securities (“RMBS”) at Jefferies. The indictment further alleged that Jefferies acted as a matchmaker, serving as a conduit for a bond to pass from a seller to a buyer of RMBS and that the firm’s
profit on such trades was the difference between the price it paid the seller and the price it charged
the buyer. The indictment further alleged that Litvak used materially false misrepresentations to
increase the profitability of trades. For example, the indictment alleges that Litvak misrepresented
to buyers of RMBS the price Jefferies had paid for the security and misrepresented to sellers of
RMBS the price Jefferies charged for the security.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.

2

If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified mail.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Assistant Secretary
