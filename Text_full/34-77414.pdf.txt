In the Matter of
CRUCIBLE CAPITAL GROUP, INC. and
CHARLES MOORE

ORDER DISMISSING PROCEEDING AS TO CRUCIBLE CAPITAL GROUP, INC.
On August 8, 2014, we instituted administrative proceedings against Crucible Capital
Group, Inc. (“Crucible”), a registered broker-dealer, and its founder, president, and sole
shareholder, Charles Moore (“Moore”).1 The Order Instituting Proceedings (“OIP”) alleged,
among other things, that Crucible violated the net capital and books-and-records provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that Moore aided and abetted and caused those
violations.2 The OIP therefore ordered proceedings to determine whether the allegations were
true and whether it was appropriate in the public interest to impose sanctions.3
The proceedings, however, have been stayed since August 20, 2014, at the request of the
United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which instituted a
parallel criminal action against Moore (United States v. Moore, No. 1:14cr648 (S.D.N.Y.)).4 The
law judge granted the stay under Commission Rule of Practice 210(c)(3), which provides that a
representative of a United States Attorney’s Office may be granted leave to participate in a
proceeding “for the purpose of requesting a stay during the pendency of a criminal investigation

or prosecution arising out of the same or similar facts that are at issue in the pending
Commission” proceeding.5
On November 9, 2015, Moore pleaded guilty in the parallel criminal action to one count
of obstructing a regulatory examination in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1519. He was sentenced on
February 18, 2016, to six months of imprisonment followed by two years of supervised release.
Also, on February 18, 2016, Moore settled the Commission proceeding by consenting to findings
that he willfully aided and abetted and caused Crucible’s net capital and books-and-records
violations, and to the imposition of an industry bar and cease-and-desist order.6
The Division of Enforcement now requests that we dismiss the administrative proceeding
as to Crucible. The Division states that dismissal is warranted because Crucible “is no longer
operational, having withdrawn its broker-dealer registration,” and “is defunct.” As to potential
monetary relief, the Division states that there is nothing for Crucible to disgorge “because the
conduct alleged in the OIP did not result in the firm receiving any money,” and that “Crucible
has minimal assets that could be used to satisfy any civil penalty imposed against it.”7
We conclude that, under the circumstances, it is appropriate to grant the Division's
motion.8
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that this proceeding be dismissed as to Crucible Capital
Group, Inc.
By the Commission.

The Division states that Crucible has “one bank account, which it recently closed with a
final balance of $114, and shares of stock in a few microcap issuers that are difficult to value
because the shares are either restricted or free trading but illiquid.”
