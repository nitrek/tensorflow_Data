In the Matter of
JOSEPH L. PITTERA, ESQ.

CORRECTED ORDER DENYING
MOTION TO LIFT TEMPORARY
SUSPENSION AND DIRECTING
HEARING

On August 26, 2016, we issued an order instituting proceedings (“OIP”) against Joseph L.
Pittera, Esq., pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i).1 The OIP temporarily
suspended Pittera, an attorney licensed in California, from appearing or practicing before the
Commission.2 Pittera has now filed a petition, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii),3 requesting that his

Rule 102(e)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(i), provides, in relevant part, that:
The Commission, with due regard to the public interest and without preliminary hearing,
may, by order, temporarily suspend from appearing or practicing before it any
attorney . . . who has been by name:
(A) Permanently enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his
or her misconduct in an action brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding
and abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the
rules and regulations thereunder; or
(B) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an action brought by the
Commission to which he or she is a party . . . to have violated (unless the
violation was found not to have been willful) or aided and abetted the violation of
any provision of the Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations
thereunder.

temporary suspension be lifted. For the reasons set forth below, we have determined to deny
Pittera’s petition and set the matter down for hearing.
On January 22, 2016, the Commission filed a complaint against Pittera and others in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.4 The complaint alleged that
between February 2011 and June 2011, Pittera wrote and signed ten baseless and incorrect attorney
opinion letters opining that certain shares of MusclePharm Corp. (“MSLP”) stock were “free
trading” and could be sold without a restrictive legend, thereby enabling the holders of these shares
to sell unregistered stock on the open market when no exemption from registration was available.
Based on these allegations, the complaint charged Pittera with issuing incorrect and baseless
opinion letters in violation of Sections 5(a) and (5)(c) of the Securities Act of 1933.5 As to Pittera,
the complaint sought a permanent injunction, disgorgement of unlawful proceeds plus
prejudgment interest, a civil money penalty, and a penny stock bar. Pittera did not respond to the
complaint.
On April 11, 2016, the clerk of the court entered default against Pittera, and on May 31,
2016, the court entered an Order Granting the SEC’s Motion for Default Judgment and Permanent
Injunctive Relief Against Defendant Joseph L. Pittera. The court found that by virtue of the
default and failure to respond, Pittera was deemed to have admitted the allegations of the
complaint. It therefore found that Pittera committed the Section 5 violations alleged. The court
ordered Pittera to pay $5,823.29 as disgorgement of profits and interest and a second-tier civil
penalty of $50,000 pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act.6 The court also enjoined
Pittera from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and permanently barred him from participating in
penny stock offerings.
In issuing the OIP, we found it “appropriate and in the public interest” that Pittera be
temporarily suspended from appearing or practicing before the Commission based on (1) the
permanent injunction from violating Federal securities laws entered against Pittera, by reason of
his own misconduct, by the Southern District of Florida, a court of competent jurisdiction, in an
action brought by the Commission; and (2) the findings of the Southern District of Florida, in an
action brought by the Commission, that Pittera violated the Federal securities laws. We stated
that the temporary suspension would become permanent unless Pittera filed a petition seeking to
lift it within thirty days after service of the OIP, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(ii). We further
advised that, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(3)(iii), upon receipt of such a petition, we would either lift
the temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing, or both.
In his petition, Pittera states that he was misled by his client and by MSLP in writing and
signing the opinion letters. He admits that he lacked sufficient knowledge of securities law to
issue the opinion letters and that he relied on documents provided by MSLP. Pittera asserts that
he acted “with only negligence” rather than extreme negligence or intent and that his conduct

therefore does not establish a violation of Section 5(a) or 5(c). He further states that he has not
written any similar opinion letters since June 2011. With regard to the default judgment entered
against him, Pittera states that his counsel contacted Commission staff to request an extension of
time to respond to the complaint without receiving any response, and that he did not anticipate that
a default judgment would be entered.7 Finally, Pittera asserts that suspension under Rule 102(e)
would be punitive because his violations were insignificant and de minimis.
Rule 102(e)(3)(iii) provides that, “[w]ithin 30 days after filing of a petition [to lift a
temporary suspension] in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the Commission
shall either lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing at a time and place
designated by the Commission, or both.”8 We have determined to deny Pittera’s petition and set
the matter down for hearing before an administrative law judge.9 Continuing Pittera’s temporary
suspension, pending a hearing on the issues raised in his petition, serves the public interest and
protects the Commission’s processes. As discussed, Pittera was found by a district court to have
violated the Federal securities laws by issuing incorrect and baseless attorney opinion letters on ten
occasions, and was permanently enjoined for his misconduct. The court’s action provided two
statutory bases for the Commission to temporarily suspend Pittera without a preliminary hearing.
It appears that Pittera remains licensed as an attorney. Although he states in a declaration that he
has “changed [his] entire practice away from Securities Law,” he states that denying him the
opportunity to practice securities law would create financial hardship for his family, suggesting
that he may continue or resume practicing in this area. It therefore appears that Pittera remains in
a position to harm the Commission’s processes if the temporary suspension is lifted and he is
permitted to practice before the Commission pending the outcome of a hearing.
In our August 26 order, we found it “appropriate and in the public interest” to temporarily
suspend Pittera. Pittera has not provided, nor do we find, any persuasive basis to question or
revisit that determination.
Under the circumstances, we find it appropriate to continue Pittera’s suspension pending
the holding of a public hearing and decision by an administrative law judge. As provided in Rule
102(e)(3)(iii), we will set the matter down for a public hearing. We express no opinion as to the
merits of Pittera’s claims.

Pittera attached to his petition a copy of a motion to vacate the default judgment that he has
filed in the Southern District of Florida.

The Commission has denied other Rule 102(e)(3)(iii) petitions in order to serve the public
interest and protect the integrity of its processes. See, e.g., Diane D. Dalmy, Esq., Exchange Act
Release No. 76980, 2016 SEC LEXIS 354 (Jan. 27, 2016); R. Scott Peden, Esq., Exchange Act
