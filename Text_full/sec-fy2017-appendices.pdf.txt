APPENDICES

Appendix B: Verification and Validation of Performance Data
The SEC’s programs require accurate data to properly assess
program performance and to make good management
decisions. The SEC performs data verification and validation
to evaluate whether data has been generated according to
specifications, satisfy acceptance criteria, and is appropriate
and consistent with its intended use. Data verification is a
systematic process for evaluating a dataset compared to a
series of standards regarding its completeness, correctness,
and consistency, using the methods and criteria defined in
the project documentation. Data validation follows the data
verification process and uses information from the project
documentation to ascertain the usability of the data in light
of its objectives and to ensure that results obtained are
scientifically defensible.
The SEC ensures that the performance data presented in
this report is complete, reliable and accurate based upon
the following assessment steps:
(1)	 The agency develops performance measures through
its strategic planning process.

(2)	 The SEC’s divisions and offices perform steps
to ensure that data used in the calculation of
performance measures is accurate and reliable,
including adequately documenting:

the sources of the underlying data elements, and
the procedures used to gather the data;
the procedures used to obtain assurance as to the
accuracy and reliability of the data; and
the data definitions for reference, as well as the
measure calculations.

(3)	 The divisions and offices calculate and report the
performance measures to the Office of Financial
Management, and the measures are approved by
division directors and office heads. This process
ensures that the data used in the calculation of
performance measures is accurate and reliable
and that internal control is maintained through the
approval process.
