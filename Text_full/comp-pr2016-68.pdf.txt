ECF CASE

COMPLAINT AND
JURY DEMAND

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúCommission‚Äù) alleges the following
against defendants Town of Ramapo, New York (the ‚ÄúTown of Ramapo‚Äù or the ‚ÄúTown‚Äù), Ramapo
Local Development Corporation (‚ÄúRLDC‚Äù), Christopher P. St. Lawrence (‚ÄúSt. Lawrence‚Äù),
Nachman Aaron Troodler (‚ÄúTroodler‚Äù), Michael Klein (‚ÄúKlein‚Äù), and Nathan Oberman
(‚ÄúOberman‚Äù) (collectively, Defendants‚Äù):

SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS
1.

This action concerns numerous fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions about

the financial condition of the Town of Ramapo and the RLDC in connection with 16 municipal
securities offerings between September 2010 and September 2015. These offerings are listed in an
appendix to this Complaint.
2.

Beginning in 2010, the Town of Ramapo and the RLDC undertook to construct a

minor league baseball stadium, now known as Provident Bank Park. This project (the ‚ÄúBaseball
Stadium Project‚Äù) was politically unpopular and cost at least approximately $60 million,
significantly straining municipal finances already impaired by declining sales and property tax
revenues.
3.

That financial strain caused Town Supervisor and RLDC President St. Lawrence

and the other Defendants to commit the fraud that is the subject of this action, to conceal the true
condition of Town and RLDC finances in an attempt to avoid further political fallout from the
Baseball Stadium Project. The object of the fraud was to mask the deterioration of the Town‚Äôs
primary operating fund, i.e., the General Fund, in order to facilitate various bond financings that
are set forth in an appendix to this Complaint. Overall, the Town raised more than $300 million
over the period 2010 to 2015 (about $85 million of it ‚Äúnew money‚Äù) on the basis of materially
false representations to investors concerning the financial health and wherewithal of the Town.
4.

In particular, St. Lawrence masterminded and directed a scheme to artificially

inflate the balance of the General Fund for at least FY 2009 through FY 2014, by recognizing
fraudulent receivables, omitting unpaid liabilities, and improperly recording transfers from other
funds with different tax bases.

of land to the RLDC. Because title to the property was never transferred from the Town to the
RLDC, Klein also made misleading statements about the receivable‚Äôs source.
8.

Troodler, formerly the RLDC‚Äôs Executive Director and an Assistant Town

Attorney, participated in the scheme to inflate the General Fund balance by, among other things,
certifying official statements that contained a fraudulent $3.08 million receivable and an
additional fabricated $3.66 million receivable for a purported transfer of land from the Town to
the RLDC. The only land transferred from the Town to the RLDC during the time of the
purported $3.66 million transaction was a property donated for the baseball stadium, which
Troodler and St. Lawrence knew did not impose any payment obligation on the RLDC. Troodler
also helped to conceal the fraudulent nature of the $3.08 million receivable by approving RLDC
financial statements that reflected a purchase of property from the Town that never took place.
9.

Oberman, the Town‚Äôs Deputy Finance Director, participated in the scheme to

inflate the General Fund balance by, among other things, directing improper transfers from the
Ambulance Fund to the General Fund totaling $12.4 million between FY 2009 and FY 2014.
10.

The inflated General Fund balances were included in offering documents used to

market Town of Ramapo and RLDC-issued bonds to investors, who considered the condition of
the General Fund a significant factor when making their investment decisions.
11.

St. Lawrence, Troodler, and Klein signed false representations in connection with

certain of the bond issues indicating that, to the best of their knowledge, the offering documents
did not contain material misstatements or omissions.
12.

St. Lawrence, with Oberman‚Äôs assent, also knowingly provided inaccurate

information about the balance of the General Fund to a credit rating agency that assigned ratings
to bonds issued by the Town of Ramapo and the RLDC.

4

13.

Immediately after a teleconference with the rating agency in January 2013 in

which St. Lawrence represented that for FY 2012, the Town experienced ‚Äúa stable balance [of
$2,004,151] in the General Fund,‚Äù St. Lawrence directed Town employees to complete an
upcoming ‚Äúrefinancing of the short-term debt as fast as possible, because . . . we‚Äôre going to
have to all be magicians to get to . . . those numbers.‚Äù
14.

St. Lawrence and Troodler also endeavored to conceal from investors that the

RLDC‚Äôs operating revenues were insufficient to cover debt service on bonds that the RLDC
issued in April 2011 and refinanced in February 2013 to pay for a portion of the baseball
stadium‚Äôs construction (the ‚ÄúStadium Bonds‚Äù).
15.

Because the Stadium Bonds were guaranteed by the Town of Ramapo, St.

Lawrence‚Äôs and Troodler‚Äôs concealment of the RLDC‚Äôs revenue shortfall masked the likelihood
that the RLDC‚Äôs debt service payments would need to be subsidized by the Town and, in turn,
result in further deterioration of the General Fund.
16.

By virtue of the conduct alleged herein: (A) each of the Town of Ramapo, the

RLDC, St. Lawrence, Troodler, and Klein, directly or indirectly, singly or in concert, has
engaged in acts, practices and courses of business that constitute violations of Sections 17(a)(1),
(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (‚ÄúSecurities Act‚Äù) [15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 77q(a)(1), (2) and (3)]
and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù) [15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78j(b)]
and Rule 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder [17 C.F.R. ¬ß 240.10b-5(a), (b) and (c)]; (B) Oberman
has violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and 10b5-(c) thereunder; (C) St. Lawrence and Troodler are liable under
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act as controlling persons for the violations of the RLDC, and St.
Lawrence for the violations of the Town, under Sections 17(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Securities

5

Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder; (D) St.
Lawrence, Troodler, Klein, Oberman, and the RLDC aided and abetted the violations of the
Town of Ramapo under Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder; and (E) St. Lawrence, Troodler,
Klein, Oberman, and the Town of Ramapo aided and abetted the violations of the RLDC under
Section 17(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 10b-5(a), (b) and (c) thereunder.
17.

Unless the Defendants are permanently restrained and enjoined, they will again

engage in the acts, practices, and courses of business set forth in this complaint and in acts,
practices, and courses of business of similar type and object.
NATURE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND RELIEF SOUGHT
18.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by

Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. ¬ß 77t(b)] and Section 21(d)(1) of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78u(d)(1)] seeking to restrain and permanently enjoin the Defendants from
engaging in the acts, practices, transactions and courses of business alleged herein. The
Commission also seeks conduct-based injunctions and undertakings against the Defendants,
including an order:
‚Ä¢

requiring the Town of Ramapo and the RLDC to retain a Court-Appointed
Independent Consultant to review and recommend improvements to their
financial reporting and municipal security disclosure policies, procedures, and
controls and to monitor their mandated implementation of such recommendations
for a period of five years;

6

‚Ä¢

requiring the Town of Ramapo and the RLDC, for a period of five years, to retain
an Independent Auditing Firm not unacceptable to the Commission staff to
conduct audits of their annual financial statements;

‚Ä¢

prohibiting the Town of Ramapo and the RLDC, for a period five years, from
engaging in the offer or sale of their own municipal securities unless, prior to
doing so, they retain and cooperate with an Independent Disclosure Counsel not
unacceptable to the Commission staff; and

‚Ä¢

prohibiting St. Lawrence, Troodler, Klein, and Oberman from participating in any
offering of municipal securities, including engaging in activities with a broker,
dealer, or issuer for purposes of issuing, trading, or inducing or attempting to
induce the purchase or sale of any municipal security.

19.

The Commission also seeks a final judgment ordering Defendants to pay civil

money penalties pursuant to Section 20(d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. ¬ß 77t(d)] and Section
21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78u(d)(3)]. Finally, the Commission seeks any other
equitable relief that the Court may deem appropriate pursuant to Section 21(d)(5) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. ¬ß 78u(d)(5)].
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
20.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1331 and

Sections 20(b), 20(d) and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 77t(b), 77t(d) and 77v(a)] and
Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].
21.

7

Southern District of New York. For instance, the Town of Ramapo is located in Rockland
County, New York and the RLDC‚Äôs principal place of business in located in Rockland County,
New York.

THE DEFENDANTS‚Äô VIOLATIVE CONDUCT
Background regarding the General Fund
28.

The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the Town of Ramapo. Tax

revenues and other receipts that are not allocated by law or contractual agreement to another
fund are accounted for in the General Fund.
29.

Financial statements for governmental funds, including the General Fund, focus

on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources.
30.

Investors in municipal securities issued or guaranteed by the Town of Ramapo

gave significant attention to the condition of the General Fund.
31.

The Defendants knew that the credit rating agency that rated securities issued by

the Town and the RLDC also focused on the balance of the General Fund and trends relating to
the same.
32.

As of fiscal year-end 2008, the Town reported a General Fund balance of

$4,501,666, with its adopted budgets for FY 2009 and FY 2010 projecting continued annual
surpluses. Following the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, however, property and sales tax

9

revenues declined, and for FY 2009, such tax revenues came in at $3.6 million under budget for
the General Fund.
33.

Beginning in FY 2009, pressure on the Town‚Äôs finances also resulted from

increased debt service payments stemming from bonds issued to finance various projects,
including the purchase of land for the Baseball Stadium Project.
34.

In late 2009, a CPA employed in the Town‚Äôs Finance Department prepared

analyses of the anticipated FY 2009 General Fund results for St. Lawrence and Oberman. The
analyses showed that the General Fund was expected to end the fiscal year with a balance of
between approximately $500,000 and $1,000,000. This represented a 75% decline from the prior
year and the first decline in General Fund reserves in five years.
35.

In November 2009, the Finance Department employee reminded Oberman that

the Finance Department‚Äôs review of the ‚Äúactual amounts (2009) for the General fund‚Äù showed
that it would be ‚Äúdifficult to attain‚Äù the General Fund results that had previously been budgeted
for FY 2009 and FY 2010.
The $3,080,000 Receivable
36.

To plug most of the hole in the General Fund for FY 2009, St. Lawrence and

Oberman approved recording a $3,080,000 receivable in the General Fund. The receivable was
purportedly for a sale by the Town of Ramapo of a 13.7 acre parcel of land known as the
Hamlets to the RLDC.
37.

The notes to the Town of Ramapo‚Äôs FY 2009 financial statements, for which St.

Lawrence and Oberman signed a management representation letter, also stated that the
$3,080,000 receivable was for ‚Äúamounts due from the [RLDC] for the sale of land.‚Äù

10

38.

In fact, Defendants knew that the Town did not complete a sale of the Hamlets to

the RLDC as of FY 2009 or even as of the issuance of the Town‚Äôs FY 2009 financial statements
on July 20, 2010.
39.

Title to the Hamlets never transferred to the RLDC. Nevertheless, transfer of the

Hamlets property by the Town to the RLDC was reported in their respective FY 2009 financial
statements.
40.

Recording the fictitious sale of the Hamlets appeared to boost the FY 2009

balance of the Town‚Äôs General Fund by $3,080,000.
41.

During an audit of the Town of Ramapo‚Äôs FY 2010 financial statements in early

2011, the auditors told St. Lawrence, Klein, and Oberman that the failure to close the Hamlets
sale required reversing the $3,080,000 receivable in the General Fund.
42.

Because St. Lawrence did not want to take the $3,080,000 receivable off the

books of the General Fund, he contrived with Klein‚Äôs assistance and Oberman‚Äôs assent to
‚Äúmatch‚Äù the amount of the receivable to a transaction involving a different parcel of land in the
vicinity of Elm Street.
43.

In fact, Defendants knew that the Town of Ramapo had already donated the Elm

Street land to the RLDC in 2009 for a housing project known as Ramapo Commons.
44.

In May 2011, Klein, knowingly or with reckless disregard, falsely claimed to the

Town‚Äôs auditors that the $3,080,000 receivable was derived from the transfer of the Elm Street
land. He claimed that the $3,080,000 amount was based on an agreement by the RLDC to
reimburse the Town of Ramapo for the Town‚Äôs $7.5 million acquisition cost of the Elm Street
property (the ‚ÄúElm Street Reimbursement Agreement‚Äù).

11

45.

Klein had previously claimed that the $3,080,000 amount represented the

purchase price for the Hamlets.
46.

The Elm Street Reimbursement Agreement contained no mention of $3,080,000

and deferred any payment by the RLDC until an undetermined future time after, among other
things, the sale of substantially all of 132 units at Ramapo Commons. It also permitted the
RLDC to provide services to the Town of Ramapo in lieu of any reimbursement payment and
contemplated a waiver of the agreement ‚Äúin any instance where the RLDC is unable to repay‚Äù
the Elm Street acquisition cost.
47.

In early 2011, an employee of the RLDC acknowledged to a junior member of the

audit team that ‚Äúthere was no intention‚Äù on the part of the RLDC ‚Äúof paying [$3,080,000 to the
Town] in the near future.‚Äù
48.

In order to procure the auditors‚Äô approval for $3,080,000 receivable in the General

Fund for FY 2010, Defendants knew that the auditors required assurances that the receivable
would be collected in substantial part within the 2011 calendar year.
49.

In about May 2011, St. Lawrence and Klein (based on information provided by

St. Lawrence) knowingly, or with reckless disregard, falsely represented to the auditors that the
RLDC would pay $1,080,000 of the $3,080,000 ‚Äúimminently‚Äù and the $2,000,000 balance by the
end of 2011.
50.

Around that time, St. Lawrence also knowingly, or with reckless disregard, falsely

told the Town‚Äôs auditors that the RLDC had been very successful in selling units at Ramapo
Commons, the proceeds from which he said the RLDC planned to pay the Town. In fact, the
RLDC had not yet closed on the sale of a single housing unit at the Ramapo Commons project
and had no other source of revenue because the baseball stadium had yet to open.

12

51.

The Town‚Äôs FY 2010 financial statements, for which St. Lawrence signed a

management representation letter, continued to recognize a $3,080,000 receivable in the General
Fund even though the contemplated Hamlets sale on which it was based had not occurred and
even though the relationship of the receivable to the Elm Street Reimbursement Agreement was
a sham.
52.

Contrary to St. Lawrence‚Äôs and Klein‚Äôs representations to the Town‚Äôs auditors,

the RLDC did not make any payment toward the $3,080,000 in 2011.
53.

In early 2012, with the entire $3,080,000 still outstanding, Defendants knew, or

recklessly disregarded, that the Town‚Äôs auditors would not agree to keep the receivable as an
asset in the General Fund for FY 2011 without further assurances that it would be collected in
substantial part within the 2012 calendar year. Based on the pace of sales at Ramapo Commons,
Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that such a timetable was not realistic.
54.

Nevertheless, St. Lawrence and Klein (based on information provided by St.

Lawrence) knowingly, or with reckless disregard, falsely represented to the Town‚Äôs auditors that
the RLDC would pay the Town $1,000,000 within the 2012 calendar year and the remaining
$2,080,000 by the end of 2013.
55.

The Town‚Äôs FY 2011 financial statements, for which St. Lawrence signed a

management representation letter, continued to report the $3,080,000 receivable an asset in the
General Fund. The Town‚Äôs FY 2011 financial statements also falsely claimed that the
$3,080,000 receivable was due from the RLDC for ‚Äúvarious services and reimbursable amounts.‚Äù
56.

Contrary to St. Lawrence‚Äôs and Klein‚Äôs representations to the auditors, none of the

$3,080,000 was paid by the end of 2012 or 2013.

13

57.

In 2013, Klein privately acknowledged to a colleague that his representations to

the auditors regarding the $3,080,000 receivable had ‚Äúpushed a gray area too far.‚Äù
58.

In May 2013, Oberman acknowledged to an agent from the U.S. Department of

the Treasury, in reference to the $3,080,000 receivable, that the Town of Ramapo had been
carrying an asset on its balance sheet for several years that ‚Äúshould not be there.‚Äù
59.

In communications with the Town‚Äôs auditors around the summer of 2013, with

the $3,080,000 receivable still outstanding, St. Lawrence attributed the delay in payment by the
RLDC to a purported refusal by the New York Attorney General‚Äôs Office to approve closings of
Ramapo Commons units in individual phases, which was untrue.
60.

For FY 2012 through FY 2014, the auditors required that the receivable be

denominated as a nonspendable component of fund balance. 1
61.

Nevertheless, the total General Fund balance remained overstated because it was

not proper to include a receivable for proceeds from a sale of the Hamlets that never took place.
62.

The Town and the RLDC have never restated their FY 2009 through FY 2014

financial statements to reflect that the sale of the Hamlets did not occur. St. Lawrence, Oberman,
and Troodler signed management representation letters for certain such financial statements. St.
Lawrence, Oberman, and Troodler also approved Management‚Äôs Discussion & Analysis sections
for certain such financial statements, which were incorporated in official statements for 16
securities offerings by the Town or the RLDC between September 2010 and September 2015.
63.

Between September 2010 and September 2015, official statements or placement

memoranda for 14 securities offerings by the Town of Ramapo overstated the balance of the
General Fund through inclusion of the $3,080,000 receivable. 2
1

The receivable was reduced to $2.5 million in FY 2014.

14

64.

St. Lawrence signed closing certificates for such offerings by the Town of

Ramapo falsely stating that, to the best of his knowledge, the offering documents did not contain
material misstatements or omissions.
65.

In connection with one such offering by the Town, Klein knowingly, or with

reckless disregard, signed an opinion letter dated December 3, 2012 that falsely represented to
the underwriter that ‚Äúnothing ha[d] come to his attention‚Äù to cause him to believe that an official
statement dated November 28, 2012 contained any untrue statement of material fact or any
material omission.
66.

Official statements for two additional securities offerings by the RLDC, in April

2011 and February 2013, also overstated the balance of the Town‚Äôs General Fund through
inclusion of the $3,080,000 receivable.
67.

Troodler knowingly, or with reckless disregard, signed false closing certificates

for such offerings by the RLDC falsely stating that, to the best of his knowledge, the offering
documents did not contain any material misstatements or omissions.
The $3,663,547 Receivable
68.

In August 2010, St. Lawrence knowingly, or with reckless disregard, falsely

represented to a credit rating agency assigning a rating to the Town‚Äôs bonds that the General
Fund was expected to end FY 2010 with a stable balance (i.e., approximately $4 million). In
fact, a contemporaneous internal analysis prepared for St. Lawrence projected a FY 2010
General Fund balance of just $263,883.
69.

In March 2011, the credit rating agency requested unaudited FY 2010 results in

connection with its rating on the Stadium Bonds.
2

Reduced to $2.5 million in official statements for the Town‚Äôs March 2015 and September 2015 offerings.

15

70.

St. Lawrence then knowingly, or with reckless disregard, fabricated a new

receivable in the General Fund for FY 2010 in the amount of $3,663,547, which was included, in
addition to the $3,080,000 receivable, in unaudited fund balance results provided to the credit
rating agency.
71.

The preliminary official statement and final official statement for the Stadium

Bonds also falsely stated that the ‚ÄúAdjusted Fund Balance‚Äù of the General Fund for FY 2010 was
$3,011,117, which included the fraudulent $3,663,547 receivable in addition to the fraudulent
$3,080,000 receivable. Furthermore, the preliminary official statement and final official
statement falsely stated that the $3,663,547 receivable ‚Äústemm[ed] from the transfer of land to
the [RLDC] by the Town.‚Äù
72.

In fact, the only land transferred from the Town of Ramapo to the RLDC since the

end of FY 2009 was a property donated for the baseball stadium.
73.

St. Lawrence and Troodler had arranged for this donation in November 2010 and

therefore knew, or recklessly disregarded, that the transaction did not impose any payment
obligation on the RLDC.
74.

Nevertheless, Troodler knowingly, or with reckless disregard, signed a false

closing certificate for the Stadium Bonds indicating that, to the best of his knowledge, the final
official statement did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or any material omission.
75.

St. Lawrence and Troodler also signed a bond purchase agreement for the

Stadium Bonds dated April 15, 2011, knowingly, or with reckless disregard, representing to the
underwriter that the preliminary official statement and final official statement did not contain any
untrue statement of material fact or any material omission.

16

76.

The $3,663,547 receivable was never actually recorded in the Town‚Äôs books and

records and was not reflected in the Town‚Äôs audited FY 2010 financial statements, which were
issued just several weeks after issuance of the Stadium Bonds.
The $314,000 Receivable
77.

Although the Town‚Äôs audited financial statements for FY 2010 did not include the

$3,663,547 receivable, St. Lawrence manufactured other ways to artificially inflate the FY 2010
General Fund balance.
78.

For example, the Town‚Äôs FY 2010 financial statements prematurely recognized a

$314,000 receivable in the General Fund for a contemplated ‚Äì but unconsummated ‚Äì sale of
property to the Rockland County Sewer District, of which St. Lawrence was also chairman.
79.

Recording this sale transaction before it took place improperly boosted the FY

2010 balance of the Town‚Äôs General Fund by $314,000.
80.

Preliminary official statements and final official statements for four securities

offerings by the Town between June 2011 and May 2012 overstated the FY 2010 balance of the
Town‚Äôs General Fund through, among other things, inclusion of the $314,000 receivable.
81.

St. Lawrence knowingly, or with reckless disregard, signed false closing

certificates for each such offering representing that, to the best of his knowledge, the official
statements were free of material misstatements or omissions.
The $12 million Interfund Transfers
82.

Without a $3,663,547 receivable, the Town plugged much of the deficit in the FY

2010 General Fund with improper transfers from the Ambulance Fund.
83.

Between FY 2009 and FY 2014, the Town used improper transfers from the

Ambulance Fund to inflate General Fund reserves. Directed by St. Lawrence and Oberman,

17

these transfers were in amounts ranging between $1,280,000 and $2,410,960 each year. The
cumulative impact of these transfers on the balance of the General Fund ranged from $1,280,000
in FY 2009 to more than $12 million in FY 2014.
84.

During the relevant period, the tax base from which General Fund monies were

raised did not include clergy residences owned by religious corporations, whereas the tax base
from which Ambulance Fund monies were raised did include such properties. Therefore, the
Ambulance Fund had a different tax base from the General Fund.
85.

St. Lawrence and Oberman approved transfers from the Ambulance Fund to the

General Fund even though they knew or were reckless in not knowing that the Ambulance Fund
and the General Fund had different tax bases and therefore that the transfers were not permitted
by law.
86.

St. Lawrence was aware that the Ambulance Fund and General Fund had different

tax bases because he signed an annual ‚ÄúSupervisor‚Äôs Statement‚Äù showing the assessed values of
the funds.
87.

Nevertheless, on multiple occasions, St. Lawrence knowingly, or recklessly,

falsely claimed to the Town‚Äôs auditors that the General Fund and the Ambulance Fund shared the
same tax base.
88.

Employees in the Town‚Äôs Finance Department also voiced concerns to Oberman

and Klein that the transfers from the Ambulance Fund to the General Fund were improper.
89.

In 2014, St. Lawrence acknowledged to other members of the Town Board and

Klein that he used the Ambulance Fund as a slush fund for the General Fund.
90.

Between September 2010 and September 2015, preliminary and final official

statements or placement memoranda for 16 securities offerings by the Town of Ramapo and the

18

RLDC overstated the balance of the General Fund by including improper interfund transfers. St.
Lawrence, Troodler, and Klein each knowingly or recklessly made false representations in
connection with certain of these bond issues that, to the best of their knowledge, the offering
documents were free of material misstatements or omissions.
91.

Between FY 2010 and FY 2014, a significant portion of the transfers from the

Ambulance Fund, ranging between $450,000 and $1,424,609 each year, was also prematurely
recorded, before the Ambulance Fund was able to provide those cash amounts.
92.

In order to record the transfers in the fiscal year preceding the actual receipt of

cash by the General Fund, St. Lawrence and Oberman knowingly, or with reckless disregard,
improperly directed that these anticipated future cash receipts be included on the General Fund‚Äôs
balance sheet as interfund balances ‚Äúdue from‚Äù the Ambulance Fund to the General Fund. This
was a false statement because no obligation, in fact, existed between the two funds.
93.

Interfund balances are appropriate to record when moneys are owed between

funds, such as for services provided or loans. However, in this case, the Ambulance Fund had no
obligation to the General Fund nor did the General Fund have a claim to the cash in the
Ambulance Fund as of the end of each applicable fiscal year. As a result, the Town disguised an
anticipated improper flow of assets from the Ambulance Fund to the General Fund as a
legitimate entitlement to such assets by the General Fund.
94.

Between September 2010 and September 2015, preliminary and final official

statements or placement memoranda for 16 securities offerings by the Town of Ramapo and the
RLDC overstated the balance of the General Fund by including these improper interfund
balances. St. Lawrence, Troodler, and Klein each knowingly or recklessly made false

19

representations in connection with certain of these bond issues that, to the best of their
knowledge, the offering documents were free of material misstatements or omissions.
Unrecorded Liabilities
95.

From FY 2011 through FY 2014, the financial statements for the Town‚Äôs General

Fund improperly omitted an accounts payable owed to the engineer for the Baseball Stadium
Project of at least $767,224.
96.

During this period, Klein was in possession of the unpaid invoices but did not

forward them to the Town‚Äôs bookkeeping personnel.
97.

When an accountant in the Town‚Äôs Finance Department raised the issue of the

unpaid invoices with Oberman, Oberman also did nothing to correct the Town‚Äôs accounting
records.
98.

St. Lawrence knew how much was owed to the stadium engineer and knew or was

reckless in not knowing that the liability was not recorded on the Town‚Äôs financial statements.
99.

Between September 2012 and May 2013, offering documents for four bond issues

by the Town and one bond issue by the RLDC inflated the balance of the General Fund through
omission of the liability owed to the stadium engineer.
100.

In FY 2010, RLDC financial statements, which were also incorporated into the

Town‚Äôs financial statements in summary form, omitted a separate liability in excess of $700,000
relating to legal fees for the Baseball Stadium Project.
101.

The RLDC continued to omit liabilities for certain legal fees from its financial

statements in at least FY 2011 and FY 2012.
102.

According the RLDC‚Äôs bookkeeper, the RLDC had a practice of ‚Äúnever put[ting]

[legal counsel‚Äôs] outstanding bills on [the] books.‚Äù

20

103.

Upon learning of this practice, Troodler remarked to the bookkeeper, ‚ÄúApparently

you have a touch of [St. Lawrence] in you, who knew?‚Äù
104.

Between June 2011 and May 2014, offering documents for eight bond issues by

the Town and two bond issues by the RLDC inflated the net assets of the RLDC through the
omission of liabilities owed to legal counsel.
The $3,145,503 Receivable
105.

In connection with bond offerings by the Town and RLDC in late 2012 and early

2013, St. Lawrence repeatedly represented to the credit rating agency and the underwriter for
certain bond offerings that the General Fund was estimated to end FY 2012 with ‚Äúno change‚Äù
from the prior year‚Äôs $2,004,151 balance. St. Lawrence knew, or recklessly disregarded, that
these representations to the credit rating agency and the underwriter were false.
106.

These representations contradicted contemporaneous internal analyses prepared

for St. Lawrence estimating a substantially negative fund balance.
107.

In January 2013, an employee in the Town‚Äôs Finance Department reminded St.

Lawrence and Oberman that her records for FY 2012 were inconsistent with the estimates that
had been given to the credit rating agency.
108.

Nevertheless, on January 25, 2013, St. Lawrence told the credit rating agency on a

phone call that for FY 2012 the Town experienced ‚Äúincreased fund balances across the board,
and a stable balance in the general fund.‚Äù Oberman was also present for the call.
109.

Immediately after the call with the rating agency, St. Lawrence directed Town of

Ramapo officials including Oberman, ‚ÄúListen I‚Äôm going to tell you this right now. We need to
do this [upcoming] refinancing of the short term debt as fast as possible, because . . . we‚Äôre going
to have to all be magicians to get to some of those numbers.‚Äù

21

110.

By early May 2013, the preliminary work of the Town‚Äôs auditors reflected an FY

2012 General Fund balance of negative $2,550,469, not the $2,004,151 positive fund balance St.
Lawrence had claimed to the credit rating agency.
111.

St. Lawrence then sought to delay release of the Town‚Äôs financial statements until

after June 30, by which time certain anticipated securities issuances were expected to be
completed.
112.

St. Lawrence‚Äôs plans to conceal the FY 2012 fund balance from investors grew

more complicated after execution of a search warrant at Ramapo Town Hall by the FBI on May
15, 2013. That development caused the placement agent and special disclosure counsel for an
issuance of bond anticipation notes (‚ÄúBANs‚Äù) by the Town to request unaudited FY 2012
General Fund results to include in the offering document.
113.

The request for unaudited FY 2012 results prompted St. Lawrence to create a

new, inflated receivable of $3,145,503 in the General Fund (without reporting any of the
$3,145,503 as deferred revenue) so that the unaudited fund balance appeared to be more
consistent with the previous representation made to the credit rating agency.
114.

St. Lawrence, knowingly or with reckless disregard, falsely represented to the

placement agent for the BAN offering that the $3,145,503 amount constituted reimbursements
‚Äúto be received‚Äù from FEMA for expenses incurred as a result of Hurricanes Sandy and Irene.
Klein arranged for unaudited results reflecting the $3,145,503 receivable to be sent to the
placement agent, along with St. Lawrence‚Äôs representation that the $3,145,503 was for
reimbursements ‚Äúto be received‚Äù from FEMA.
115.

However, other Town personnel had previously informed St. Lawrence, as well as

Klein, that the $3,145,503 amount was in substantial part for claims that had not yet been

22

submitted and/or might never be approved by FEMA. As of May 13, 2013, an internal tracking
sheet routinely shared with St. Lawrence and Klein reflected that the Town ‚Äúanticipated‚Äù
reimbursement from FEMA of less than $800,000 for expenses relating to Hurricanes Sandy and
Irene. Therefore, the representation that $3,145,503 was ‚Äúto be received‚Äù from FEMA was false.
116.

Among other requirements, properly recording a receivable for FEMA

reimbursement in the General Fund for FY 2012 would have required that the General Fund
actually incur the expenses in FY 2012 for which the reimbursement was being sought. St.
Lawrence and Klein knew, or recklessly disregarded, that the $3,145,503 amount consisted
primarily of expenses that either had not been incurred in FY 2012 or that had been incurred by a
different fund.
117.

Even if the $3,145,503 amount had been incurred by the General Fund in FY

2012 (which it was not), it would have been improper to record the receivable without deferring
the revenue (and therefore creating an offsetting liability). That is because, according to the
Town‚Äôs financial statements, revenue is not recognized unless, among other things, it is collected
within 90 days following the end of the applicable fiscal year.
118.

St. Lawrence and Klein knew, or recklessly disregarded, the applicability of this

90-day availability criterion, which was discussed in the Town‚Äôs annual financial statements. St.
Lawrence and Klein also knew, or recklessly disregarded, that none of the $3,145,503 had been
collected as of the date of the May 2013 placement memorandum, which was more than 90 days
after the end of FY 2012.
119.

On May 21, 2013, St. Lawrence participated in a call with the Town‚Äôs auditors

regarding the unaudited FY 2012 results, which included the $3,145,503 receivable (without

23

corresponding deferred revenue). The auditors were unable to provide any comfort concerning
the validity of these numbers, which they had just received from St. Lawrence that day.
120.

Nevertheless, the placement memorandum for the BAN offering stated that the

FY 2012 general fund balance was $1,495,034, including the $3,145,503 receivable. The
placement memorandum also stated that the $3,145,503 was ‚Äúto be received‚Äù from FEMA. St.
Lawrence, knowingly or with reckless disregard, signed a false closing certificate representing
that the placement memorandum did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or any
material omission.
121.

In June 2013, the Office of the New York State Comptroller released a report

identifying the Town as one of the state‚Äôs most fiscally distressed municipalities based in part on
information concerning the FY 2012 General Fund balance provided by an employee in the
Town‚Äôs Finance Department.
122.

After release of that report, Klein publicly announced that the employee‚Äôs

numbers were flawed because they omitted $3.5 million in revenue, a figure that included the
fraudulent $3,145,503 receivable.
123.

When the Town of Ramapo released its audited financial statements for FY 2012,

the $3,145,503 receivable was reduced to only about $743,338.
124.

Including the $743,338 as an asset in the Town‚Äôs General Fund without deferring

the revenue was still improper because, although that amount was for expenses incurred in FY
2012, none of it had been collected within 90-days following the conclusion of FY 2012.
Therefore, it fell outside the applicable availability window.
125.

In May 2014, a placement memorandum for a BAN offering by the Town

overstated the balance of its FY 2012 General Fund by, among other things, including the

24

$743,338 receivable. St. Lawrence, knowingly or with reckless disregard, signed a false
certificate that that the placement memorandum did not contain any untrue statement of material
fact or any material omission.
Concealment of the Baseball Project‚Äôs Costs
126.

In addition to fraudulently overstating the General Fund, St. Lawrence and

Troodler engaged in a scheme to understate the anticipated impact of the Baseball Stadium
Project on future General Fund reserves.
127.

In August 2010, Town voters overwhelmingly defeated a proposed guarantee of

long-term bonds that were to be issued by the RLDC to finance construction of the baseball
stadium.
128.

The Town Board subsequently approved a guarantee of the Stadium Bonds, which

originally had a five-year maturity schedule that avoided the referendum requirement applicable
to longer-term financing.
129.

In the wake of political opposition to the Town‚Äôs guarantee of financing for the

Baseball Stadium Project, St. Lawrence repeatedly claimed in public statements and in
communications with the credit rating agency and underwriter that the RLDC would be able to
meet its financial commitments and that the RLDC‚Äôs debt would be self-supporting.
130.

In April 2011, the preliminary official statement and final official statement for

the Stadium Bonds issued by the RLDC represented that, while the Town had financed the
baseball stadium property‚Äôs $8 million acquisition cost and spent $6 million in ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù site
and field work, the $25 million Stadium Bonds would ‚Äúfulfill the balance of financing needs‚Äù for
the Baseball Stadium Project.

25

131.

This implied that the ‚Äúvertical‚Äù construction costs ‚Äì for which Stadium Bond

proceeds were being used ‚Äì would not exceed $25 million and that the total cost of the Baseball
Stadium Project ‚Äì including the land and horizontal improvements previously financed by the
Town ‚Äì would not exceed $39 million.
132.

In actuality, the RLDC, including St. Lawrence, had been informed that ‚Äúvertical‚Äù

construction costs alone would range between at least $35 million and $40 million.
133.

Troodler also knew or recklessly disregarded that the Baseball Stadium Project‚Äôs

costs were expected to exceed the amounts represented in the preliminary official statement and
final official statement for the Stadium Bonds.
134.

Nevertheless, St. Lawrence and Troodler signed a bond purchase agreement

representing to the underwriter of the Stadium Bonds that the preliminary official statement and
final official statement did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or any material
omission. Troodler also signed a closing certificate representing the same, to the best of his
knowledge.
135.

As it turned out, the Baseball Stadium Project‚Äôs land, site, and construction costs

totaled at least approximately $60 million, more than a 50% increase from the $39 million
implied in the official statement.
136.

Most of that additional cost was financed through Town-issued general obligation

bond proceeds, whose repayment portends significant strain on General Fund reserves for years
to come.
137.

The foreseeability of this result as of April 2011 was concealed from investors

through the false representation that the Stadium Bonds would ‚Äúfulfill the balance of financing
needs‚Äù for the Baseball Stadium Project.

26

Concealment of the RLDC‚Äôs Operating Revenue Shortfall
138.

The Stadium Bonds had a ‚Äúdirect pay‚Äù guarantee structure so that the Town of

Ramapo, as guarantor, would make the payments of interest and principal to bondholders and
receive reimbursement for those payments from the RLDC, which issued the bonds. In April
2011, the official statement for the Stadium Bonds stated that the RLDC was expected to
reimburse the Town in full for the interest and principal payments out of the RLDC‚Äôs Baseball
Stadium Project and Ramapo Commons housing project revenues.
139.

That purported expectation was premised on the stale and knowingly false

assumptions regarding construction costs and on projected Baseball Stadium Project revenues of
$1.8 million annually, which without any evident basis substantially exceeded the revenues
projected in a feasibility study.
140.

In May 2012, a credit rating agency rating the Town‚Äôs debt requested that the

RLDC update its stadium revenue projections. Draft projections prepared for St. Lawrence by
the RLDC‚Äôs financial advisor reflected an expectation that the RLDC would generate insufficient
revenues to reimburse the Town for annual debt service on the Stadium Bonds. These
projections were not disclosed to the rating agency. Instead, St. Lawrence claimed that, going
forward, the stadium was expected to generate an average of $3.4 million in revenue annually
(i.e., nearly twice the projected amount in the financial advisor‚Äôs draft), including $1.9 million
for concerts and events (i.e., more than three-times the financial advisor‚Äôs draft projections).
141.

In fact, the stadium generated just about $768,107 of gross revenue in its first year

of operation (FY 2011), including $734,102 of baseball revenue and $34,005 of event revenue,
and has never generated more than $1.3 million in gross revenue in any year.

27

142.

With a $1,937,500 payment of principal and interest due on March 15, 2012, the

RLDC‚Äôs revenue shortfall resulted in a scramble by St. Lawrence and Troodler to find funds to
reimburse the Town for the debt service payment. Ultimately, the RLDC was only able to satisfy
its obligation by drawing down on a line of credit at St. Lawrence‚Äôs direction.
143.

In September 2012, St. Lawrence and Troodler had to scramble again for the

RLDC to find funds to cover reimbursement of the interest payment. Accordingly, St. Lawrence
and Troodler arranged for a round-trip transfer of funds between the RLDC and the Town.
Specifically, the Town of Ramapo transferred more than $500,000 to the RLDC and the RLDC
used such funds to reimburse the Town for the $411,250 interest payment due on the Stadium
Bonds.
144.

Without the Town‚Äôs subsidy, the RLDC would not have been able to reimburse

the Town for its interest payment.
145.

In November 2012, an analysis performed for St. Lawrence and Klein by the

financial advisor to the Town and RLDC concluded that the RLDC‚Äôs revenue shortfall warranted
restructuring the Stadium Bonds to extend their maturity date from 2016 to 2041 so that more of
the annual debt service could be covered ‚Äúby the operation of the RLDC.‚Äù
146.

St. Lawrence and Troodler were directly familiar with the revenue shortfall,

having resorted to borrowed funds and Town subsidies for the RLDC to satisfy its debt service
reimbursements on the Stadium Bonds.
147.

Nevertheless, at St. Lawrence‚Äôs direction, an official statement dated November

28, 2012 for an issue of Town bonds falsely stated that the Town had ‚Äúbeen fully reimbursed by
the [RLDC] for . . . interest and principal amounts [due in 2012 on the Stadium Bonds] for a total

28

of $2,348,750 utilizing the operating revenues of the [LDC].‚Äù In fact, much of the money used
by the RLDC to make principal and interest payments had not come from operating revenues.
148.

St. Lawrence knowingly, or with reckless disregard, signed a closing certificate

dated December 3, 2012 falsely representing that, to the best of his knowledge, the November
28, 2012 official statement did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or any material
omission.
149.

Klein also knowingly, or with reckless disregard, signed an opinion letter for the

November 2012 issue falsely representing that nothing had come to his attention to cause him to
believe that the official statement contained any untrue statement of material fact or any material
omission.
150.

In February 2013, the preliminary official statement and final official statement

for an issue of bonds by the RLDC to refund the original Stadium Bonds and extend their
maturity schedule (the ‚ÄúRefinanced Stadium Bonds‚Äù) repeated the false statement that the Town
had ‚Äúbeen fully reimbursed by the [RLDC] for . . . interest and principal amounts [due in 2012
on the Stadium Bonds] for a total of $2,348,750 utilizing the operating revenues of the [RLDC].‚Äù
151.

St. Lawrence and Troodler signed a bond purchase agreement for the Refinanced

Stadium Bonds dated February 7, 2013, knowingly, or with reckless disregard, representing to
the underwriter that the preliminary official statement and final official statement did not contain
any untrue statement of material fact or any material omission. Troodler, knowingly, or with
reckless disregard, signed a false closing certificate for the Refinanced Stadium Bonds indicating
that, to the best of his knowledge, the final official statement was free of material misstatements
and omissions.

29

152.

St. Lawrence also knowingly, or with reckless disregard, falsely represented to the

underwriter of the Refinanced Stadium Bonds that the Baseball Stadium Project had generated
$1.75 million of revenue in 2012, which was more than twice the actual (but undisclosed) results.
153.

The Refinanced Stadium Bonds had a guarantee structure akin to the original

Stadium Bonds, whereby the Town agreed to make payments of principal and interest directly to
bondholders and the RLDC agreed to advance or reimburse the Town the funds to make those
payments.
154.

The preliminary official statement and final official statement for the Refinanced

Stadium Bonds misleadingly stated that these reimbursements were expected to come primarily
from the RLDC‚Äôs Baseball Stadium Project revenues. St. Lawrence and Troodler, knowingly, or
with reckless disregard, signed false representations to the underwriter that the official statement
did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or any material omission, and Troodler,
knowingly, or with reckless disregard, signed a false closing certificate stating that, to the best of
his knowledge, the final official statement did not contain any untrue statement of material fact
or any material omission. Klein also represented to the news media that Baseball Stadium
Project revenues would ‚Äúbe adequate to pay the debt service‚Äù on the Refinanced Stadium Bonds.
155.

Those representations, knowingly or recklessly made by St. Lawrence, Troodler,

and Klein, were misleading because they omitted the fact known to St. Lawrence and Troodler
that the RLDC had actually lost $538,060 on non-baseball concerts and events in FY 2012, a
component of Baseball Stadium Project Revenue that the RLDC previously trumpeted as a
significant source of funds for debt service.
156.

Troodler, at St. Lawrence‚Äôs direction, knowingly or recklessly compounded the

omission in April 2013 by falsely telling a reporter that the RLDC had refinanced the Stadium

30

Bonds in February 2013 only to save on interest expenses and not because the RLDC‚Äôs revenue
stream was inadequate to make the bond payments. The story was eventually published in
Newsday and included Troodler‚Äôs misrepresentation.
157.

St. Lawrence and Troodler knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that

inadequate revenues were the primary reason to refinance the Stadium Bonds, but he and St.
Lawrence determined to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the information about the refinancing differently.
158.

By no later than about March 2013, St. Lawrence knew, or recklessly disregarded,

that 2012 Baseball Stadium Project revenues were not even enough to cover stadium-related
expenses. Disclosure of that fact would have called into question the RLDC‚Äôs ability to
reimburse the Town for debt service payments on the Refinanced Stadium Bonds. Accordingly,
St. Lawrence omitted information about the RLDC‚Äôs FY 2012 revenue shortfall from a May 24,
2013 placement memorandum, which stated that the RLDC was required to reimburse the Town
for future debt service payments on the Refinanced Stadium Bonds. The omission made the
placement memorandum misleading. Nevertheless, St. Lawrence, knowingly or with reckless
disregard, signed a false ‚ÄúCertificate of the Town Supervisor‚Äù dated May 28, 2013 stating that
the placement memorandum did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or any material
omission.
159.

In October 2013, St. Lawrence and Klein prepared a response to an inquiry from a

Bloomberg News reporter falsely stating that RLDC ‚Äúrevenues have been sufficient to cover its
debt service.‚Äù
160.

In three official statements and placement memoranda between May 2014 and

September 2015, the Town made additional false statements regarding the source of the RLDC‚Äôs
debt service reimbursements, leaving investors with a misimpression that the RLDC was

31

generating recurring revenues sufficient to cover the debt service on the Refinanced Stadium
Bonds.
161.

In March 2014, the RLDC‚Äôs first reimbursement payment was due to the Town on

the Refinanced Stadium Bonds, but once more the RLDC lacked sufficient funds until three days
before a payment to bondholders was due, when the RLDC sold a parcel of land, resulting in a
one-time cash infusion. The Town falsely claimed in a May 2014 placement memorandum that
the source of the reimbursement payment was Ramapo Commons housing project revenues,
which were recurring. St. Lawrence, knowingly or with reckless disregard, signed a false
‚ÄúCertificate of the Supervisor‚Äù dated May 27, 2014 stating that the placement memorandum did
not contain any untrue statement of material or any material omission.
162.

In September 2014, the RLDC was only able to reimburse the Town for its debt

service because St. Lawrence, Troodler, and Klein arranged in August 2014 for the Town Board
to approve a resolution authorizing the transfer of $695,000 from the Town to the RLDC to
subsidize legal fees incurred by the RLDC.
163.

On around August 2014, the Town transferred $495,000 to the RLDC pursuant to

this resolution, thus transforming the RLDC‚Äôs bank balance from negative to positive. At St.
Lawrence‚Äôs direction, Troodler did not use the funds to pay the legal fees but instead used them
to pay the Town $557,000 for its debt service payment on the Refinanced Stadium Bonds due
