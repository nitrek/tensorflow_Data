UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
October 28, 2016

In the Matter of
Q Lotus Holdings, Inc., and
Spare Backup, Inc.,
ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING
File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Q Lotus Holdings, Inc.
(CIK No. 1391142), a defaulted Nevada corporation with its principal place of business
listed as Chicago, Illinois with stock quoted on OTC Link (previously, “Pink Sheets”)
operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the ticker symbol QLTS,
because it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended December 31, 2013.
On April 7, 2016, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to
Q Lotus Holdings, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and Q
Lotus Holdings, Inc. received the delinquency letter on April 11, 2016, but failed to cure
its delinquencies.
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Spare Backup, Inc. (CIK

No. 1103577), a void Delaware corporation with its principal place of business listed as
Minden, Nevada with stock quoted on OTC Link under the ticker symbol SPBU, because
it has not filed any periodic reports since the period ended March 31, 2013. On February
26, 2013, a delinquency letter was sent by the Division of Corporation Finance to Spare
Backup, Inc. requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations, and Spare
Backup, Inc. did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid
address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule 301 of
Regulation S-T, 17 CFR 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual).
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of
investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed companies.
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed companies is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on October 28, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EST on November
10, 2016.
By the Commission.
