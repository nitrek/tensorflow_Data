FOREWORD
This is the fourteenth annual report to the Congress about the work
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Of necessity it is only
a summary and a selection of the more significant Commission activities. The day-to-day work load is presented primarily through statistical tables and other condensed compilations. The Commission is
always ready to give any additional information that may be requested.
This report should be of particular help to members of the Congress
who have had no experience with the work of the Commission. An
attempt has been made to outline the regulatory provisions of the
statutes administered by the Commission and to relate each segment
of Commission activity to the specific authority under which it is
performed.

PART I
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933is designed to prevent fraud in the sale
of securities. It affords to investors the protection of full and fair
disclosure of information about the security offered for sale and, at
the same time, prohibits the employment of certain practices in connection with the sale of securities as fraudulent. The act provides
for the registration of securities and for the use of a prospectus in
their sale, both designed to provide the investor with sufficient facts
about the security to enable him to make an informed judgment of
the merits of the investment before he buys the security offered to
him. In addition, the act defines and prohibits certain practices to
prevent active fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit in the sale of
securities. The Commission IS charged with the enforcement of these
provisions as to the adequate disclosure of information and the prevention of active fraud, but it does not pass upon the merits of securities registered with it under the act. The fact that a registration
statement has been filed under the act, or that it has been examined by
the Commission's staff, or that the registration statement is in effect
does not imply any approval or disapproval by the Commission of
the security as an investment. The act does not aim at the elimination
of risk in investment, but only at the disclosure of sufficient information to enable the investor to measure the risk involved.
THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
The Registration Statement and Prospectus

A security may be registered with the Commission by filing a registration statement with the Commission, and it is one of the Commission's most important functions under the act to examine these
statements to insure their compliance with the statutory requirements
as to the contents of a registration statement. An integral part of
each statement is the prospectus, consisting of pertinent information
about the security to be sold. Unless a registration statement is in
effect as to a security, the act makes it unlawful to sell or offer to buy
the security through the mails or in interstate commerce, and it is
also made unlawful thereby to sell or deliver any security unless accompanied or preceded by a prospectus meeting the requirements of
the act.
The prospectus brings the pertinent information about the security
directly to the attention of the investor, but it should be pointed out
that the filing of any registration statement, which is immediately
made public by the Commission pursuant to the statute, instantly
gives rise to widespread publicity released by financial news services,
financial writers, and newspapers generally.
Effective Date of Registration Statement

In order to permit widespread publicity among investors of the
information contained in a registration statement, the act provides
1

2

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

for a 20-day waiting period after the filing of the registration statement before the registration statement becomes effective and the
security may be offered for sale. If the registration statement is
amended after it is filed but before it has become effective, the 20-day
waiting period starts anew from the time of the amendment, unless
the amendment is filed with the consent of or by order of the
Commission.
The Commission is empowered at its discretion to accelerate the
effective date of a registration statement, in cases where the facts
justify such acceleration, so that a fu1l20-day period need not expire
before the securities may be offered for sale. The act directs that,
in the exercise of this power, the Commission must give due regard
to the adequacy of the information about the security already available to the public, to the complexity of the particular financing, and
to the public interest and the protection of investors.
Examination oC Registration Statements

An important step in the registration process is examination of
registration statements to insure their compliance with the requirements of the act. In view of the fact that a registration statement
may become effective on the twentieth day after filing, this examination
must be completed with a maximum speed consistent with thoroughness and a full consideration of all the facts. Neither the Commission,
the issuer, nor the underwriter desires a statement to become effective
unless it complies with the act. It is often the case that the staff will
ascertain that deficiencies exist in the registration statement, or the
issuer or underwriter may wish to amend the statement or delay its
effectiveness for business reasons. In such cases, if there is a danger
that the registration statement may become effective in defective form
or prematurely for the purposes of the issuer or underwriter, it is
customary for the issuer to file a minor amendment to the registration
statement, thereby starting the 20-day period running anew.
In order to speed the registration process, and at the same time to
make available to the registrant the assistance of the Commission's
staff of experts, the Commission has continued to make widespread
use of the procedures of its prefiling conference and "letter of comment." The prefiling conference enables the registrant to discuss with
the staff, prior to the filing of the registration statement, any special
or novel problems involved in the particular registration statement.
The letter of comment is an informal device by which the registrant
is informed of any deficiencies found upon examination to exist in
the registration statement as filed. The registrant can thereupon
make the necessary amendments and thereby prevent the registration
statement from becoming effective in deficient form.
Time Required Cor Registration

The Commission seeks to accomplish completion of the registration
process, from the time the registration statement is filed to the time
when it becomes effective, within the 20-day waiting period provided
by the act. With the cooperation of persons in the securities industry
it constantly studies ways to shorten the process, and a great deal has
been accomplished in this direction during the 1948 fiscal year. During the 1947 fiscal year the average median elapsed time was 30lh
days. In the 1948fiscal year it was 24% days.

FOURTEENTH

ANNUAL

3

REPORT

More significant than the average for the year are the averages for
each month during the 1948fiscal year. In 1 month the elapsed median
time was only 21 days. In 4 months it was only 22 days, in 1 m0I?-th
23 days and in 2 months 24 days. In the other 4 months the median
time was 25, 27, 30, and 32, respectively. It is to be noted that in
no month did the median time from the date of filing to the date
when the Commission provided the registrant with a letter of comment
exceed 12 days, which was the case in only 1 month. In the other
months, this median time was only 9 days in 2 months, 10 days in
7 months, and 11 days in 2 months. It may be pointed out that in
the 2 months when the total median elapsed time was 30 and 32 days,
respectively, the letter of comment was provided in the median time
of 11 and 12 days, respectively. In the same months, the median
elapsed time from the date of the letter of comment to receipt of
the first amendment to the registration statement was 12 and 10 days,
.respectively, substantially above the average for the whole year,
which was 8.4 days.
In evaluating this data, and in comparing it with the goal of 20
days total elapsed time, it must be borne in mind that a single registration statement may substantially affect the figures for the whole
month. Thus, as has been indicated, the issuer or underwriter may
seek to delay effectiveness for business reasons, perhaps to await a
better market. It is also the case that some registration statements
require more amendment than others, or amendment of a more complex
nature, so that the total elapsed time is increased. These are the two
major reasons for a total elapsed time of more than 20 days, and inasmuch as these situations occur invariably in one or more cases in each
month, the median figures must be interpreted accordingly. In the
1948 fiscal year 1,778 amendments were filed prior to the time when
the registration statements became effective. Of these 980 were filed
intentionally to delay effectiveness and 798 were filed in order to make
material changes in the registration statement.
The Commission will continue to study its processes with the aim
of further reductions in the total elapsed time for registration, and
it has every indication that this may be accomplished. The figures as
to the time required for registration in the 1948 fiscal year are presented in the following- table:

The volume of securities registered for cash sale for the accounts of
the issuers in the 1948 fiscal year was greater than that for the prior
year. A small decrease in the volume of bonds was more than compensated for by an increase in the volume of stocks which brought the
volume of stocks to within 5 percent of the highest volume of stocks
'Tins ficut I' dllfe", from the 440 shown in the table on \l R due to difference in the

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the 1948 fiscal year, investment bankers were used for the sale
of 75 percent of the total securities registered for cash sale for the
accounts of issuers as compared with 83 percent in the 1947fiscal year.
Commitments by investment bankers to purchase for resale involved
60 percent of the total registered for cash sale for the accounts of
issuers, as compared with 68 percent in the 1947 fiscal year,"
E. COST OF FLOTATION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED FOR CASH SALE FOR THE
ACCOUNTS OF ISSUERS

The cost of flotation of securities registered for primary cash distribution, as reported in the registration statements for such securities,
amounted to 6.1 percent of the aggregate dollar volume of such securities. A further break-down of this 6.1 percent indicates that 5.5
percent represented commissions and discounts and 0.6 percent all
other expenses incidental to the flotation of the securities, including
all costs relative to registration. A study of the portion of aggregate
gross proceeds paid as compensation to investment bankers on securities registered for sale to the general public through such bankers
reveals a downward trend for bonds but a sharp interruption of the
downward trend for preferred stock in the 1948 fiscal year and a
slightly higher rate for common stock in 1948than in the five previous
years.

year being due chiefly to the larger amount of securities placed privately. Offerings in the noncorporate category declined moderately,
reflecting a substantial decline in sales of United States savings bonds
more than offsetting an increase in State and municipal offerings.

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE A(.'T

The Commission is empowered under section 3 (b) of the act to
exempt from registration, subject to such terms and conditions as it
might prescribe by rule and regulation, issues of securities not exceeding an aggregate offering price to the public of $300,000. Five
regulations have been adopted pursuant to this authority: Regulation
A, a general exemption for small issues; regulation A-R, a special
exemption for notes and bonds secured by first liens on family dwellings; 9 regulation A-M, a special exemption for assessable shares of
stock of mining companies; regulation B, an exemption for fractional
undivided interests in oil or gas rights: and regulation B-'1', an exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types of trusts or unincorporated associations.
The availability of an exemption under any of these regulations
does not include any exemption from civil liabilities under section 1:2
or from criminal liabilities for fraud under section 17. In order to
insure the proper enforcement of these sections, the conditions for
the availability of the exemptions provided by these regulations, with
the exception of regulation A-R, include the requirements that certain
minimum information be filed with the Commission and that disclosure of certain information be made in sales literature.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulalion A

The trend of business to make greater use of public offerings under
regulation A continued during the fiscal year. In the 1948 fiscal year
1,610 letters of notification were filed and examined under the regulation, compared to 1,513in the 1947fiscal year. At the same time the
aggregate offering price of the securities covered by these letters of
notification remained about the same, decreasing slightly from
$210,791,114in the 1947 fiscal year to $209,485,794in the 1948 fiscal
year. A major increase is noted in connection with companies engaged
in the oil and mining industries. Companies engaged in various
phases of the oil and gas business filed 101 letters of notification in
the IV48fiscal year for a total of $12,797,478in securities and oil and
gas leases. In"the 1947 fiscal year they filed 68 letters of notification
for $8,660,261. Mining companies filed 181 letters of notification in
the 1948 fiscal year for a total of $18,594,453in securities.
The relative size of proposed offerings last year under regulation A
is reflected in the following distribution of 1,594letters of notification
• Inasmuch as no reports or filings are required under this regulat lon, no stn t lst lca l data
as to its application and use are uvatlabte.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(omitting data as to 16 which were incomplete and subsequently withdrawn) : First group, 851 of $100,000 or less; second group, 324 of
more than $100,000 but less than $200,000; and third group, 419 of
more than $200,000 but not more than the statutory maximum of
$300,000. Of these 1,594 offerings, 1,392 were made by issuers, distributed generally through all size groups; 186 by stockholders, all
occurring in the first group; and the remaining 16 jointly by the issuer
and a stockholder.
In 930 cases the offerings were to be made without use of an underwriter. .An underwriter was to be used in the remaining 664 cases.
Of these, a commercial underwriter was to be employed in 486 cases,
distributed by size as follows: First group, 262; second group, 84;
and third group, 140. In 178 cases officers and directors of the issuer
or other persons not regularly engaged in the underwriting business
were to be used as underwriters.
The regulation makes provision for the filing of the requisite letter
of notification at the appropriate regional officeof the Commission for
the greater convenience of small businesses making use of this regulation. The letters of notification and the related sales literature are
examined in the regional office where filed and then reviewed by a
staff of experts at the Commission's central office. This review involves a search for pertinent information in the Commission's extensive files and an examination to determine whether the exemption of
the regulation is applicable in the particular case and whether the
information filed discloses any violations of any of the acts administered by the Commission. The results of this review are made available promptly to the regional officeinvolved; 1,916letters were written
in this connection during the fiscal year!. in addition to the numerous
letters written by the various regional otnces, which have the primary
responsibility as to offerings under regulation A. Further, the Commission cooperates with the proper authorities in the States in which
the securities are proposed to be offered by informing them of the fact
that the offering is to be made and giving them a summary of pertinent
data concerning the proposed offer.
It should be emphasized that the exemption from registration provided by regulation A, as well as by the other exemptions granted
under section 3 (b), does not constitute complete exemption from all
provisions of the act. Thus, these exemptions are subject to the express
provisions of section 12 imposing civil liability on persons who sell
securities in interstate commerce or through the mails by means of
untrue statements or misleading omissions, and to the provisions of
section 17, which makes it unlawful to sell securities by such means
or by other types of fraud. By their express terms, each of these sections is applicable whether or not the transactions involve securities
which have been exempted under section 3 (b). Accordingly, the
principal effect of a section 3 (b) exemption is to permit the sale of
small issues of securities on the basis of a less complete formal filing
than that required by the act in the case of a registered security.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A-M

Last year the Commission received and examined a total of seven
prospectuses covering an aggregate offering price of $241,34:6for assessable shares of stock of mining corporations conditionally exempted
from registration pursuant to rule 240 of regulation A-M.

FOURTEENTH

REPORT

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

Promotions in oil and gas securities increased considerably during
the past year. This expansion is reflected especially in the sharp
increase in the number of filings under regulation A which cover oil
and gas stock offerings as mentioned above. In addition to the 101
offerings in the 1948 fiscal year under regulation A relating to oil and
gas securities, 87 offering sheets were received and examined under
regulation B. Regulation B provides :for the conditional exemption
from registration of fractional undivided interests in oil and gas rights
where the aggregate offering price does not exceed $100,000. The following actions were taken with respect to these offering sheets:

Oonfidential written reports of sales under regulation B.-Offerors
seeking exemption pursuant to regulation B are required under rules
320 (e) and 322 (c) and (d) to file with the Commission written
reports of sales actually made by broker-dealers or offerors to individual investors and by dealers to other dealers. In the 1948 fiscal
year 3,088 reports were received and examined under these provisions.
Of these, 2,990 reports were on Form 1-G and 98 on Form 2-G, representing aggregate sales of $823,259 and $264,608 respectively. These
reports are to be kept confidential, under the rules, unless the Commission orders otherwise.
Oil and gas investigations.-The
Commission's technical oil and gas
staff made a number of analytical studies in the course of the year
leading to the preparation of valuation estimates and technical memoranda, including the preparation of comprehensive charts relating
estimated oil recoveries to past production of interests sold by royalty
dealers, both for individual tracts and entire fields covering such tracts
in various locations :from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.
Studies of this kind form a significant part of the staff's work in conducting the oil and gas investigations which are made to determine
whether there have been any violations of sections 5 (requiring registration) or 17 (prohibiting :fraudulent sales) of the Securities Act or
section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act (regulating the conduct of
brokers and dealers) in the sale of oil and gas securities.
During the year 13 such oil and gas investigations were instituted by
the Commission, making a total of 143 current during the year; 12
investigations were closed during the year and 131 were pending at
the end of the year. In connection with these investigations, the Commission's staff prepared some 1,175 technical letters, reports, and
memoranda, and conducted nearly 250 personal and telephone conferences during the year, In addition, a special unit which has been

12

SECURITIES AND EXCHA..l'oWECOMMISSION

established within the Tulsa regional officeprepared about 650 such.
letters, reports, and memoranda.
Four of these investigations led to an injunction against the persons
concerned from violating the registration and fraud provisions of the
Securities Act. In a fifth case the facts were referred to the Department of Justice for 'possible criminal prosecution. An indictment has
been returned in a sixth case.
An example of the manner in which the Commission is sometimes
called upon to render technical assistance in litigation arising out of
these oil and gas investigations may be cited in the Grayson case,
which involved the sale of oil royalties. Stanley Grayson had been
convicted in the United States District Court, Southern District, New
York, in early 1947and had entered an appeal. Before the hearing on
the appeal, a petroleum engineer of the Commission's staff was called
upon to advise the assistant United States attorney as to whether, in
view of the sharp increase in the price of oil, the interests sold by Grayson might return the original investment. After the circuit court of
appeals had remanded the case for retrial, this engineer made a 3-week
field trip to reexamine physically certain of the oil properties involved
and to locate witnesses who could furnish primary factual evidence.
The assistant United States attorney accompanied the Commission's
engineer on a part of this trip and was convinced that, notwithstanding
the greatly increased price of crude oil, the properties in which interests had been sold by Grayson would not produce sufficientoil to return
the investment. Grayson pleaded guilty rather than face retrial and
was sentenced on June 8, 1948, to a year and a day in prison, and he
was placed on probation for a period of 3 years after release from
imprisonment during which time he is prohibited from engaging in
any manner in the sale of securities.
FORMAL ACTIONS UNDER SECTION 8

The Commission employs its various informal procedures, such as
conferences and the letter of comment, to insure that a registration
statement shall comply ...
vith the requirements of the act before it
becomes effective. In almost all cases this practice has been found
to be sufficientboth for the needs of the registrant and for the adequate
protection of investors. It is sometimes necessary, however, for the
Commission to exercise its powers under section 8 in order to prevent
a registration statement from becoming effective in deficient or misleading form or to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement which has already become effective.
Under section 8 (b) the Commission may institute proceedings to
determine whether it should issue an order to prevent a registration
statement from becoming effective. Such proceedings are authorized
if the registration statement as filed is on its face inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. Under section 8 (d), proceedings may
be instituted at any time to determine whether the Commission should
issue a stop order to suspend the effectiveness Of a registration statement if it appears to the Commission that the registration statement
includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
any material fact required to be stated or otherwise necessary to make
the statements included not misleading. Un~er section 8 (e) the

FOURTEENTH ~~UAL

REPORT

13

Commission may make an examination to determine whether to issue
a stop order under section 8 (d).
In the 1948 fiscal year the Commission instituted two examinations
under section 8 (e) and one proceeding under section 8 (d). In the
1947 fiscal year seven examinations and five proceedings were instituted.
Examinations Under Section 8 (e)

Where examinations are conducted by the Commission under section 8 (e) it is the practice to direct that the proceedings be held
privately to prevent any injury that might be done to a registrant
through adverse publicity if, after the examination, it is determined
that no violation of law has been committed. The Commission does,
however, have the power to hold such examinations in public and may,
after the close of a private proceeding, order that the record be made
public. Both of the two examinations ordered to be held in the
current year were held in private. One of these was still pending at
the close of the year. In the second case the record of the examination
was made public."
Stop-Order Proceedings Under Seclion 8 (d)

Two stop-order proceedings were pending at the beginning of the
year and one other was instituted during the year.
Globe Aircraft Oorp.-File No. ::?-6i304.-This case was pending
at the beginning of the year and is discussed in full at page Hi of the
Thirteenth Annual Report. As a result of the proceeding the Commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement on the basis of the misleading nature. of its contents.
The formal opinion of the Commission was published in Securities
Act Release No. 3255 (1947). For a fuller discussion of this case see
the section herein on activities of the Commission in accounting and
auditing at page 108.
Kiwago Gold Mines, Ltd.-File No. :2-685:2.-This case also was
pending at the beginning of the year and is described fully at page 18
of the Thirteenth Annual Report. The Commission issued a stop order
during the year suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement. A formal opinion was published in Securities Act Release
No. 3278 (1948).
T'homasoolor,Inc.-File No. :2-7142.-Proceedings in this case were
instituted during the fiscal year. The company filed a registration
statement on July 9, 1947, relating to a proposed public offering of
1,000,000 shares of $5 par value class A common stock at a price of
$10 per share. The underwriter did not contract to purchase the
stock but only to use his best efforts in its sale. Stop-order proceedings were instituted on September 2, 1947, after extensive preliminary investigation, includmg consultation with technical experts,
into the accuracy and adequacy of the information filed in the registration statement, much of which related to complex and technical
aspects of color photography. Hearings in the matter were started
on September 16, 1947, and the record was closed on October 20, 1947.
The order for proceeding alleged that the registration statement
contained material misstatements and omissions of fact and it conre Securities Act Release No. 3277 (1948).

14

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tained a complete statement as to such deficiencies. Generally, they
were of four types: First, the statement of the proposed allocation of
proceeds from the sale of the stock was incomplete and inaccurate;
second, the registrant made false claims as to the technical nature of
the process it was going to exploit; third, there was a failure to make
adequate and accurate disclosure of the history of the registrant and
of the relationship of various individuals to the registrant; and
fourth, the financial statements included in the registration statement
were highly misleading in certain respects.
During the course of these proceedings the registrant admitted
that the proposed allocation of proceeds appearing in the registration
statement was incomplete and inaccurate. The amended registration
statement sets forth a complete revision in the allocation of proceeds
and contains a full discussion of their proposed application. It is
indicated that the initial proceeds of the offering will be used to pay
liabilities of the registrant, consisting primarily of organization and
stock issue expense and legal fees, estimated to exceed $300,000.
Among the claims contained in the original registration statement
thereafter admitted to be false by the registrant and deleted in the
amended registration statement were misrepresentations to the effect
that the Thomascolor process is a new system of color photography
offering many advantages over existing processes; that Thomascolor
can be employed under substantially the same conditions as ordinary
black and white photography; that the registrant proposed to exploit
first the motion-picture field; that its devices could be readily and
widely used in connection with motion picture cameras and projectors;
that its process offered great possibilities in the field of color television; and that its process had a ready market in the field of amateur
photography.
In striking contrast to these claims the record reveals and the
registration statement, as amended, discloses that the principle of
the Thomascolor process is old in the art of color photography and
has been wholly or in part abandoned or supplanted by other processes
and techniques; that the Thomascolor process requires the use of
special devices which cannot be attached to standard motion picture
cameras and projectors without substantial modifications and reengineering; that registrant's entry into the motion picture field is
conjectural because of the grave problems arising from the technical
limitations of some of its devices and the very serious economic problem arising from the necessary conversion of existing equipment; that
the registrant will devote itself principally to color printing and
publishing and still color projection; that registrant does not now
represent that its process will have any application in the field of
amateur or ordinary portrait photography; and that for the present
the registrant intends only to conduct research in the field of television and that there is no assurance that a technically or commercially feasible process will result.
The facts developed during the proceedings show that the original
registration statement did not disclose adequately and accurately the
character of the various enterprises preceding the organization of the
registrant. The record shows that the various predecessor organizations, which were controlled by Richard Thomas, who was instrumental in organizing the registrant and who controlled it, were primarily

FOURTEENTH ~AL

15

REPORT

promotional and development organizations; that they had not produced on a commercial basis; and that at most they had constructed
only prototypes of a few of the devices that the registrant proposed
to market. In describing the transactions leading to the acquisition
of the assets of the predecessor interests, the registration statement
failed to make adequate disclosure of the nature of the relationships
or identity of the individuals involved or of the method of determining the amount of consideration paid for the assets and, by references to formal agreements and offers and acceptances, implied that
there had been arm's-length bargaining in the various transactions
between the three predecessor organizations and the registrant.
The financial statements contained in the registration statement,
as originally filed, were highly misleading in the disclosures and
accounting treatment of registrant's stock issued for intangibles. The
significance of this matter is evident from the fact that these intangibles amounted to $2,014,941.03 out of total assets shown in the
balance sheet aggregating $2,551,583.40. The balance sheet was
amended to carry patents and patent applications at the nominal
amount of $1, and all of the remainder of the $2,014,941.03 was then
displayed under the caption: "Other intangibles-Excess
of par or
stated value of stock issued over net tangible assets acquired on May
20, 1947 (Note 2)." In brief, the financial statements included in the
original registration statement overstated the registrant's assets and
minimized, if it did not deliberately conceal, information that would
have fairly disclosed the true nature of the assets which the registrant
represented would be used to conduct its business.
During the course of and after the close of the hearings in the section
8 (d) proceedings, the registrant filed substantial amendments which
appeared to correct satisfactorily the material misrepresentations and
omissions. The Commission thereafter dismissed the proceedings and
issued an opinion commenting, in the public interest and for the protection of investors, upon certain facts developed in the proceedings
and discussing the Commission's action in this case and the limitation
of its jurisdiction."
In this opinion the Commission also warned
the prospective investor of the danger of relying on past judgment
based on magazine articles or other earlier publicity, in view of the
admission in the proceedings that certain of such publicity contained
materially false and misleading information, and pointed out the need
for careful study of the amended registration statement and prospectus. The registration statement was permitted to become effective
after adequate dissemination of the corrected prospectus had been
made and sufficient time had elapsed since the release of the Commission's opinion. Subsequently, the registrant filed an amendment to
its registration statement for the purpose of withdrawing registration
for all but 100 shares of the stock origmally registered.

In its examination of registration statements the staff of the Commission seeks not only to insure that the registration statement contain the information required by the act but also that the information

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

be clearly stated in a simple and not misleading manner and, to the
extent possible, that the information be accurate. Due to the experience of the staff and to the availability of information about many
companies in the Commission's extensive files, it is often possible
for the staff to detect omissions of material facts, misstatements of
material facts, and statements of minor facts made in such form as to
give exaggerated and unwarranted importance to the facts out of
proportion to their materiality. In addition, the staff may request
a more simple statement of complex information so that it might be
most readily understood by the prospective investor. In most cases
a registrant makes the necessary amendments to its registration statement. The following brief case histories are examples of the failure
of registrants to make adequate and accurate disclosure discovered by
the staff after examination of the registration statements involved.
Failure To Disclose Price Differential

A. foreign gold mining exploration and development company filed
a registration statement for 666,667shares of common stock of $1 par
value. The stock was to be offered at 42.84 cents a share. However,
the stock was listed on a foreign stock exchange, where it was then
currently quoted at approximately half of the price at which the stock
was to he offered to investors in the United States. In letters and
conferences the Commission's staff pointed out to counsel for the registrant that this wide price discrepancy raised some doubt as to whether
the registrant intended to make a bona fide offering accompanied by
full disclosure of all relevant facts. The registrant subsequently made
other arrangements for its financing and, shortly after the close of the
fiscal year, filed an application for the withdrawal of its registration
statement. This company had, in addition, failed to make adequate
disclosure of its underwriting arrangements.
Exclusion of Exaggerated Claims

A. company which intended to exploit an industrial process made
many claims in its registration statement as to the nature of the process,
its use, its application in various fields, and the availability of a
market. The registration statement was thereafter amended to show
that the process was not new, that it had been wholly or partly abandoned in favor of other processes and techniques, that the registrant
does not represent that the process would have any application in
certain fields, and that the registrant would devote itself for the
present only to research and that there is no assurance that a technically or commercially feasible process would result. This case is
described in greater detail in this report under the section discussing
stop-order proceedings under section 8, above.
Sale of Stock at Different Prices

A. foreign mining company filed a registration statement for 700,000
shares of common stock at $1 per share. The company amended its
statement to disclose, in connection with the statement of the offering
price on the cover page of the prospectus, that the offering price
had been arbitrarily determined. In addition it filed an amendment
to disclose that during the 2-year period prior to the filing of the
registration statement the company had sold the stock at from 3.4 cents
to 30 cents per share, and that during such period the price in the

FOURTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

17

foreign over-the-counter market had ranged from 27% cents to 45
cents per share. In addition, the registrant indicated that it also knew
of subsequent sales at prices from 35 cents to 60 cents per share.
Disclosure of Speculative Hazards

A foreign mining company filed a registration statement for 333,333
shares of capital stock of $1 nominal value at an offering price of 30
cents a share. After examination of the statement by the staff the
registrant inserted under the heading "Introductory statement" a summary of the speculative and unusual aspects of the offering, so that
the registration statement now includes the disclosures mentioned
below.
The registrant has no operating history and the offering price of
30 cents a share was predicated solely upon future possibilities, as to
which no representations are made.
The proposed financing will serve only to conduct preliminary exploration which, at best, will enable the registrant to decide whether
additional exploratory work would be warranted, and, if such additional work becomes warranted, further financing will be required,
possibly to be followed by still further financing.
No underwriter has contracted to purchase the stock and if only
a portion of the offering is sold, the registrant has no further plans
for financing. In such event the registrant might not have sufficient
funds to carry through an adequate exploration program.
The registrant had offered 335,000 shares of stock for sale at only
15 cents a share after November 21, 1946, and only 131,000 shares were
sold. No new developments in the registrant's business outlook justify
an increase of 100 percent in the offering price over the last previous
offering price.
The underwriting commission and advertising expenses will consume 32% percent of the offering price and, after estimated total distribution expenses of approximately 36% percent, only approximately
63lf2 percent of the gross proceeds from the proposed offering based
upon the offering price will be invested in the registrant's business.
The three original promoters paid an average price of 4.59 cents
per share for the 960,000 common shares acquired by them and still retain 361,750 of such shares costing them 2.53 cents per share, and
another promoter owns 158,075 shares which cost him nothing in
money. These promoters as a group will, after the proposed financing,
retain 32.6 percent of the voting control through the ownership of
shares costing them an average of 1.76 cents a share. These four promoters, on the basis of the proposed public offering price, would have a
book profit of $146,794.75 or 28.24 cents a share.
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS,

AND FORMS

Rules, regulations, and forms adopted by the Commission must be
flexible to meet changing business conditions. Further, experience
has shown that any procedure for compliance with a regulatory statute
is made most simple, economical, and expedient for those who must
comply if each type of situation is recognized and specific provision
made for its particular need. To assure these results the Commission
has long made it a practice to maintain a continuous review of its
procedures in the light of current conditions. Changes often result,

18

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

either by reason of recommendations made by the staff or, as is frequently the case, at the suggestion of persons who must comply with
the statute. No material change is made without a series of conferences with all persons interested in or who might be affected by the
contemplated change. Changes made or planned during the 1948
fiscal year in the rules, regulations, and forms under the Securities
Act are described below. The accounting aspects of some of these
changes are discussed in Part IX of this report in the section concerning the Commission's activities in accounting and auditing.
Proposed Rule 431-Definition

of Prospectus

Information about a proposed issue of securities may be given the
most widespread publicity through use of the preeffective prospectus
under the provisions of rule 131. This prospectus, necessarily, does
not contain certain information about the security, such as the finally
determined selling price, information about underwriting agreements,
and such other data not normally available before the time when the
securities are actually offered for sale. In present practice complete
data about the security are included in the final prospectus and this
prospectus, if accurate, is the one actually used in the course of the
sale. In order to avoid the necessity of printing both the preeffective
and final prospectuses, as well as the duplications involved in two
deliveries and the delay in time attendant upon such a procedure, the
Commission took under consideration a rule intended to prevent these
results.
The proposed rule applies only to offerings by an issuer to its stockholders. Under it the information normally omitted from the preeffective prospectus could be added to that prospectus by the issuer in
the form of a short document containing the missing data. This
document and the preeffective prospectus could then together constitute the final prospectus. The proposed rule contains certain safeguards to prevent abuse of the procedure, to assure the full protection
of the act to investors, and to permit adequate inspection by the Commission of the preeffective prospectus and the supplemental document.
These safeguards provide: (1) That the preeffecti ve prospectus be
incorporated by reference into and be made part of the document;
(2) that a copy of such prospectus was sent or given, in compliance
with rule 131, to the person to whom the document is sent or given;
and, (3) that the document is sent or given to the stockholder within
20 days of the time when he was sent or given a copy of the proposed
form of prospectus. Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the Commission formulated these provisions in proposed rule 431 and issued
the rule for public comment in Securities Act Release No. 3300.
Rule 409-Disclaimer

of Responsibility

Under rule 409 a registrant may omit information from a registration statement if the information is unknown or not reasonably
available to the registrant. In such cases, the present rule provides,
in essence, that the registrant shall furnish the best information
available to it under the circumstances. In addition, the rule permits
the registrant to include in the registration statement a disclaimer
of responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of such information. The proposed amendment would strike from the rule the provision permitting this disclaimer of responsibility. The purpose of

FOURTEE~

~AL

REPORT

19

this amendment is to protect the prospective investor against inaccurate or incomplete information. The proposal was widely circulated by the Commission in Securities Act Release No. 3296 (1948).
Rule 424-Preeffective

Prospectus

Rule 131 provides for the use of a preeffective prospectus in order
to give information about a prospective issue of seeurrties the widest
possible circulation. The preeffective prospectus must comply substantially with requirements applicable to the proposed final prospectus as filed with the Commission, but there is no provision for filing
the pre effective prospectus actually used. In order to provide the
Commission with copies of such prospectus for its administrative
functions and to make them available for inspection by the general
public, the Commission proposes to amend rule 424 (which pertains to the filing of prospectuses with the Commission) in order to
require the filing of preeffective prospectuses with the Commission.
Proposed Amenlhnents to Regulation S-X

Regulation S-X contains the Commission's rules respecting the form
and content of financial statements filed with the Commission under
various of the statutes which it administers. The purpose of the proposed amendments, set out in Securities Act Release No. 3294 (1948),
is to provide rules as to the financial statements of commercial, industrial, and mining companies in the promotional, exploratory, or development stage. A full discussion of these proposals appears in
Part IX of this report under the section on the Commission's activities
in accounting and auditing.
Changes in Forms for Registration

Form 8-2 had been used for the registration of securities of certain
corporations having simple corporate structures. This form was revised to provide a simple registration form for commercial and industrial companies still in the development stage. The change permits use of Form S-2 by companies previously limited to Form S-12
and certain established companies previously using Form S-2 may
now use Form S-l, the form most generally used to register securities.
The revision of Form 8-2 made it possible for the Commission to
rescind Form S-12. See Securities Act Release No. 3247 (1947).
Form C-1 had been used for some time as a registration form for
securities of unincorporated investment trusts of the fixed or restricted management type. The subsequent adoption of other forms
for the securities of such trusts made Form C-1 obsolete and it was
rescinded during the year. See Securities Act Release No'.3247 (1947).
Form 8-3 is used to register securities-of mining corporations in the
promotional stage. Originally, the form required the inclusion of
certified financial statements as of a date within 90 days prior to the
date of filing the registration statement. The purpose of the amendment is to permit the filing of uncertified financial st.atements as of
such date if there are also filed certified financial statements as of a
date within 1 year prior to the date of filing. See Securities Act
Release No. 3269 (1947).
Rule 131, which provides for the use of the preeffective prospectus,
had been adopted originally, in December 1946, for a 6-month trial
period. In Securities Act Release No. 3240 (1947) the Commission

20

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

announced the continuance of the rule in its original form. Study
of the operation of the rule during the 6 months indicated that the
rule does facilitate the dissemination of information contained in
Securities Act registration statements.
In Securities Act Release No. 3238 (1947) the Commission announced adoption of Form 8-7. This form is designed specifically for
the registration of securities issued by the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
LITIGATION UNDER THE ACT
Part of the Commission's enforcement activity under the Securities
Act is injunctive action to prevent violations of section 5, which (with
certain exemptions) requires registration of securities offered to the
public, and section 17, which makes it unlawful to sell securities by
fraudulent means. While the Commission's investigation may result
in subsequent criminal prosecution, the injunction is used to stop activity immediately and prevent the continuance of violations. Some of
the injunction actions instituted last year are pending, but most of
them have been successfully concluded.
As a result of a story appearing in a popular magazine a number of
financing plans were offered to the public involving the use of Government bonds to guarantee repayment of the investment. This practice
has been denounced by the Secretary of the Treasury and this Commission. It involves the sale of securities under an arrangement
through which $75 of each $100 advanced by the investor is used to buy
series E bonds in the name of the investor. This investment will be
worth $100 at maturity in 10 years. The other $25 is invested in the
business enterprise sought to be financed. The Commission filed an
action to enjoin this practice, S. E. O. v, lV. Geoffrey Haynes, 12 alleging that, while the, defendant unconditionally guaranteed the return
of the original investment, he omitted to inform investors that only
one-fourth of the amount would be used in the business enterprise and
that three-fourths would be invested in Government bonds. The
complaint charged violations of both the fraud and registration provisions of the Securities Act. A similar action, ",,'.E. O. v. J ohr:
Der'J'yberry,I3 was instituted to enjoin violations of the registration
provisions of the Securities Act and the broker-dealer registration
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Derryberryengaged in the purchase and sale of oil royalties, giving to each investor
a $100 Government bond to guarantee repayment of the investment
at the end of 10 years. Again only $25 of the investor's money went
into the oil royalty. The Commission's enforcement staff has been
able to deter several promotions of this type without court action and
was able to secure full disclosure of the features of the plan in still
other cases through filings made with the Commission.
The Commission filed a complaint charging Louis A. Montague 14
with violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act in
connection with the leasing of apartments in a building under construction. Under the terms of the agreement for lease each applicant
was to loan a sum of money to Montague to be repaid within 1 year with

interest at 5 percent. Upon service of the complaint the defendant
immediately discontinued all attempts to offer securities and the action
was dismissed pursuant to stipulation.
S. E. O. v. Petroleum Royalty OorpY and S. E. O. v, Petroleum.
Southwest Oorp.» were companion cases involving the activities of
one John R. Moroney, who was president of both companies. Judgments were entered enjoining Moroney and the companies from selling
unregistered stock. Petroleum Royalty Corp. had been organized to
buy and sell oil royalties and Petroleum Southwest Corp. to produce
and sell petroleum products.
Other actions filed by the Commission to enjoin the sale of securities
in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act included S. E. O. v. Fyre-Mi.~t Inc.,17 involving a company organized for
the purported purpose of manufacturing and selling a device for the
burning of oil and water to produce enormous heat; S. E. O. v. Amos J.
DO'l1J'n8,lS involving the president of Homestake Le Roi Mining Co.
who was selling its common stock without registration; S. E. O. v.
Dixieland Petroleum. Oorp.» in which the Commission enjoined the
sale of stock which had been issued to the company's president in exchange for oil leases and the sale of additional shares for the company
without making the necessary filing; and S. E. O. v. American Silver
Oorp.,20in which an injunction was requested to prevent the defendant
from selling stock in a new company to be organized for the purpose
of taking over the assets of American Silver Co., which was at that
time in the bankruptcy court pursuant to a chapter XI proceeding.
In S. E. O. v. Edmond Michel/ the Commission charged violations
of both the registration and fraud provisions of the Securities Act in
the sale of stock of Larmloc Sales Corp. The complaint charged that
the defendants failed to register the stock and that in effecting sales
had made numerous false representations, including statements that
the Bureau of Narcotics of the Treasury Department had approved
the Larmloc device and had recommended its use bv dealers in narcotics; that it had been approved by Underwriters Laboratory, Inc.;
that use of the lock would reduce burglary insurance rates; and that
the device was in use by banks, hotels, and stores in the Chicago area.
In the case of S. E. O. v. Nye A. lVimer 22 the Commission charged
in its complaint for injunction that Wimer was selling unregistered
stock of Great 'Vestern Exploration Co. and Tennessee-Schuylkill
Corp. by means of false representations concerning the stock. The
court upheld the right of the Commission to bring the action in Pennsylvania even though the defendant resided in California and had
never personally been present in the State of Pennsylvania or the
district in which the action was instituted. The court stated that
sections 20 and 22 of the Securities Act gave it jurisdiction to hear
the case since the sale took place within that district and the defendant
had participated in the sale. Other cases in which the Commission
charged violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act include

The complaint inS. E. O. v. Metropolitan Mines Corporation; Ltd.,25
was instituted during the 1947 fiscal year but resulted in the entry of
a decree during the 1948 fiscal year requiring Metropolitan Mines
Corp. to file with the Commission annual reports as required by section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and reports of change of
ownership of equity securities by officers and directors as required by
section 16 (a) of that act, and enjoining the further sale of securities
without compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
.
In connection with its investigative function it was necessary for the
Commission during the year to institute several actions to enforce
Commission subpenas. These subpenas, issued by officers of the
Commission in connection with investigative activities, required witnesses to appear and give testimony and in some cases to produce documentary evidence for examination. In each case the Commission was
successful in obtaining the desired evidence. These cases were S. E. O.
v. Uontinental-Iliinoie Bank d':: Trust 00. of Ohicagoj26 S, E. O. v.
Edward J. O'(Ionnor]" S. E. O. v. M. E. Harrison and Allen Hull;28
S. E. O. v. Tucker 00rp.29
Tucker Oorp.-During the past year the Commission instituted a
routine investigation relating to certain activities of the Tucker Corp.
Incident to the investigation it became necessary to examine certain
books and records of the corporation and a request was made to the
officers to permit such examination. When the corporation refused
to produce the records a Commission subpena was issued and upon
the failure of the corporation to respond to the subpena the Commission authorized the filing of an action in the United States District
Court in Chicago to obtain an order requiring compliance with the
subpena. Subsequent to the filing of answers and argument on the
issues involved, the court entered an order directing the Tucker Corp.
to produce the books and records in compliance with the subpena to
be examined by an officer of the Commission at the plant of the
corporation.
Kaiser-Frazer Oorp.-One of the major investigations by the Commission during the fiscal year concerned the collapse of the third offeringof common stock of the Kaiser-Frazer Corp." On January 6,1948,
the Kaiser-Frazer Corp. filed with the Commission a registration
statement covering a proposed offering of 1,500,000shares of common
stock. Otis & Co., First California Co., and Allen & Co. were named
as underwriters. Delaying amendments were filed by the issuer to prevent the statement from becoming effective 20 days after the filing.
On February 2, 1948, the registration statement still not being effective, counsel for the corporation inquired of the Commission's staff
concerning the propriety of the issuer stabilizing the market in its
securities prior to the time of the offering. They were advised that
this could be done within certain prescribed limits and it was indi23

cated to the staff that the issuer proposed to stabilize in this manner
on the following day. On February 3, 1948, total trading for the
day amounted to 180,200 shares compared with approximately 7,000
shares on the New York Curb on the previous day. All of the shares
were purchased by Kaiser-Frazer at $13.50 per share in its stabilization effort. It was decided to conduct a private investigation for the
purpose of determining the circumstances surrounding this large
volume of trading. The private investigation disclosed facts which,
in the judgment of the Commission, warranted a public investigation
in the matter and such investigation was ordered by the Commission
on March 23, 1948.
Public hearings began on April 12, 1948, in 'Washington and were
subsequently held in seven other cities throughout the United States."
These hearings disclosed that after the registration statement had
become effective at 5 :30 p. m. on February 3, 1948, the offering which
was made at $13 per share had gone poorly and that at about 12:30
p. m. (e. s. t.) on February 4 the underwriters, Otis & Co., First California Co., and Allen & Co., who were then stabilizing for their own
account, had terminated the selling group and withdrawn the offering.
The investigation disclosed that on February 9, 1948, which was
the day for settlement between the issuer and the underwriters, Otis
& Co. and First California Co. stated that they were not bound by the
underwriting agreement. This statement was based on a provision in
the contract which provided that no material litigation not disclosed
in the prospectus should be pending against the issuer at 10: 00 a. m. on
the date of settlement. A derivative action had been filed against the
issuer in the county court for Wayne County, Mich., on that date, by
one James F. Masterson, a Philadelphia attorney, as plaintiff. He
was represented by David V. Martin, a Detroit attorney.
A number of circumstances raised serious questions in connection
with this lawsuit. Among them was the fact that Marvin C. Harrison
and Allen Hull, two Cleveland attorneys, testified under order of Judge
Lederle in the United States District Court at Detroit that they had
been retained by Cyrus Eaton, the principal stockholder of Otis & Co.,
to go to the Wayne County Court in Detroit on February 9 to determine
whether a suit similar to the Masterson suit had been tiled against the
Kaiser-Frazer Corp. Harrison and Hull refused to supply any information other than the identity of their client and based such refusal on
the attorney-client privilege. The investigation remains open."

3> In the course of thrs investrgut ion it has on tln ee occasrous been necessary for the
Commission to invoke the aid of Fodera! distrtct courts to effect compliance WIth its subpenas, In addition to the action referred to above, the Commission has instituted a SImilar
action against the same defendants in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia asking that the court order them to disclose the contents of communications WhICh
would normally fall under the attorney-client privilege, upon the ground that the Commission had made a prima facie showing that they were retamed by Eaton for a fraudulent
purpose. Judge MorrIS of that COUI t has refused to enforce the subpena. The Comrmsslon
also intervened in an action III the Federa l dtstr-lct court in Cincinnati wherein the Portsmouth Steel Co. sought to enjoin the telephone company from producing, in compliance with
a Commission subpena, certain telephone toll tickets covering calls made by certain officers
of Portsmouth Steel Co. These papers were subsequently obtamed These matters are more
fUlly covered in the section of this report relating to litigation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
33 On August 12, 1948. the Commission announced the institution
of broker-dealer revocation proceedings against Otis & Co. based on alleged VIOlationsof sections 5 and 17 of the
Securities Act of 1933 and sections 10, 15 (c) and 9 (a) (4) of the Securities Exchanl;e Act
of 1934. At the same time It was announced that similar proceedings had been instituted
against First California Co. based solely on alleged violation of section 5 of the Securi ties
Act Of 1933. The institution of both of these actions was based on facts disclosed by the
investigation.

PART II
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934:is designed to eliminate fraud,
manipulation, and other abuses in the trading of securities both on the
organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, which together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in securities; to
make available to the public information regarding the condition of
corporations whose securities are listed on any national securities
exchange; and to regulate the use of the Nation's credit in securities
trading. The authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities
transactions is lodged in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but the administration of these rules and of the other
provisions of the act is vested in the Commission.
The act provides for the registration of national securities exchanges,
brokers, and dealers in securities, and associations of brokers and
dealers.
REGULATION
Registration

OF EXCHANGES

AND EXCHANGE

TRADING

of Exchanges

Each securities exchange in the United States is required by section
5 of the act to register with the Commission as a national securities
exchange or to apply for exemption from such registration. Under this
section, exemption from registration is available to exchanges which
have such a limited volume of transactions effected thereon that, in the
opinion of the Commission, it is unnecessary and impracticable to require their registration. During the fiscal year the number of exchanges registered as national securities exchanges remained at 19 and
the number of exchanges granted exemption from such registration remained at 5.
The registration or exemption statement of each exchange contains
information pertinent to its organization, rules of procedure, membership, and related matters. To keep this information up to date
the 24 exchanges filed a total of 10~ amendments to their statements
during the 1948 fiscal year. Each of these amendments was reviewed
to ascertain that the change involved was not adverse to the public
interest and that it was in compliance with the relevant provisions of
the act. The nature of the changes effected by the exchanges in their
constitutions, rules, and trading practices varied considerably. Some
of the more sig-nificantof these changes are briefly outlined below.
Baltimore Stock Exchange reinstated a rule, which had been rescinded in 1939, prescribing requirements for companies desiring to
I emove their securities from listing on that exchange.
Chicago Stock Exchange, following several years of study and trial
operation, adopted a plan enabling its out-of-town members to clear
their own exchange transactions by mail. The primary objective of
24

FOURTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

25

the plan was to extend equal opportunities to all members and to
develop a better exchange market by providing present and prospective out-of-town members with an added profit incentive to develop
exchange business and to act as specialists in issues which are of public
interest in their respective localitiei,
Cincinnati Stock Exchange and Philadelphia Stock Exchange each
increased their rates of listing fees. In addition to the revised schedule
of listing fees, Cincinnati also adopted an annual service charge payable by all companies having securities listed on that exchange.
San Francisco Stock Exchange adopted amendments to its constitution permitting corporations to become regular members of that
exchange. Previously, corporations were eligible only for associate
membership in the exchange.
New York Stock Exchange adopted. effective November 3, 1947, a
schedule of increased commission rates on stock" selling at 50 cents
or more per share. Under the new schedule. commission rates are
computed on the basis of the amount of money involved in a transaction
aggregating not more than 100 shares rather than on a rate-per-share
basis as in the past. Following this action by the N" ew York Stock
Exchange, 12 of the 17 regional exchanges abo adopted revised schedules of commission rates which are. in many instances, identical with
the new rates of the New York Stock Exchange. The New York
Curb Exchange, however, did not effect any changes in its schedule
of commission rates.
In the latter half of 1947,the Board of Governors of the New York
Stock Exchange placed greater restrictions on members' trading for
their own account on the floor of the exchange. The modified floor
trading rules. adopted in February 1947, prohibit any purchase of
a stock by a floor trader at a price above the last sale price. Under
the policy adopted by the exchange several months later, purchases
cannot be made at a price above the last preceding different price
if that price is lower than the last sale price. Purchases at such a
price by floor traders, individually or as a group, are limited to 300
shares or 30 percent of the amount offered at that price, whichever
is greater. In April 1948the 30 percent limit was raised to 50 percent.
An exception to this policy may occur if there is an interval of 15
minutes during which no purchases by floor traders have been made.
After such an interval, floor traders may again purchase stock subject
to the limitations in the ruling. In addition, a floor trader who
acquires stock off the floor mnst sell that stock off the floor.
'Vashington Stalk Exchange, in an attempt to improve its service
to the public and to provide facilities for the execution of transactions
on the exchange which theretofore had been executed either over the
counter .01' on another exchange, extended its hours of trading to
coincide with those of the major exchanges. Only securities which are
traded on the 'Vashington Stock Exchange a;. well as on another exchange are eligible for trading during the new extended hours. Members continue to meet from 11: 15 a. m. to noon each day as in the
past to execute transactions in securities traded solely on the Washington Stock Exchange as well as in dually traded securities. The new
trading hours went into effect on July 15, 1948.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Disciplinary Actions by Exchanges Against Members

Pursuant to a request of the Commission, each national securities
exchange reports to the Commission any action of a disciplinary nature taken by the exchange against one of its members or an employee
of a member for violation of the Securities Exchange Act, any rule
or regulation thereunder, or of any exchange rule. During the year
5 exchanges reported such actions against a total of 34 members,
member firms, and partners or employees of member firms.
In nine of these cases the individual or firm involved was censured
for an infraction of the rules and warned against further violations.
The remaining actions taken included fines ranging from $50 to $2,500
in 12 cases with total fines aggregating $6,450; the expulsion of an
individual from exchange membership; the suspension of an individual and his firm from exchange membership for a period of 90 days;
the suspension of five individuals from exchange membership for
periods ranging from 3 months to 1 year; the suspension of two registered representatives of a member firm for a period of 2 months;
and the cancellation of registration of three specialists in certain of
their stocks. The disciplinary actions resulted from violations of
various exchange rules, principally those pertaining to partnership
agreements, capital requirements, handling of accounts, floor trading,
registered employees, and specialists.
Market Value and Volume of Exchange Trading

The market value of total sales effected on national securities exchanges for the 1948 fiscal year, as shown in appendix table 7,
amounted to $13,932,441,000,a decrease of 5.9 percent from the market value of total sales for the 1947 fiscal year. Of the total, stock
sales (excluding value of right and warrant sales) had a market
value of $12,899,694,000,a decrease of 6.2 percent from 1947,and bond
sales that of $996,747,000,an increase of 2.4 percent over 1947. The
market value of right and warrant sales totaled $36,000,000,involving
35,323,000units.
The share volume of stock sales (excluding unit volume of right
and warrant sales) for the 1948 fiscal year totaled 536,749,000shares,
a decrease of 3 percent from the preceding; fiscal year. Total principal amount of bond sales was $1,356,372,000,an increase of 0.5
percent over 1947.
The market value of total sales effected on exempted exchanges
for the 1948 fiscal year amounted to $9,899,000,a decrease of 13.5
percent from 1947.
Special Offerings on Exchanges

Under rule X-10B-2, special offerings of blocks of securjties are
permitted on national securities exchanges pursuant to plans filed
with and declared effective by the Commission. Briefly stated, these
plans provide that a special offering may be made when it has been
determined that the auction market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb a particular block of a security within a reasonable period
of time without undue disturbance to the current price of the security. A special offering of a security is made at a fixed price

FOURTEE~

REPORT

consistent with the existing auction market price of the security
and members acting as brokers for public buyers are paid a special
commission by the seller. Buyers are not charged a commission on
their purchases and obtain the securities at the net price of the offering. During the year the Los Angeles Stock Exchange became the
eighth national securities exchange to file and have declared effective
by the Commission a plan for special offerings. The plan of the
Los Angeles Stock Exchange is generally similar to the plans of the
other exchanges previously declared effective and which remained in
effect throughout the year.'
Three of the eight exchanges having plans in effect reported that
a total of 25 special offerings were effected during the year. These
offerings involved the sale of 332,999 shares of stock having an aggregate market value of $8,503,000. The size of these offerings ranged
from one with a market value of $1,768,000to one valued at $52,000.
Brokers participating in these offerings were paid a total of $222,000
in special commissions. By comparison, in the preceding fiscal year
a total of eight special offerings involving 104,814 shares of stock
having a market value of $2,852,000were effected on two exchanges,
with special commissions paid to brokers totaling $68,000. Further
details of special offerings during the 12-month period ended June 30,
1948,are given in appendix table 8.
Secondary Distributions Approved by Exchanges

A "secondary distribution," as the term is used in this section, is a
distribution over the counter by a dealer or group of dealers of a comparatively large block of a previously issued and outstanding security
listed or admitted to trading on an exchange. Such offerings take
place when it has been determined that it would not be in the best interest of the various parties involved to sell the shares on the exchange
in the regular way or by special offering. The distributions generally
take place after the close of exchange trading. As in the case of
special offerings, buyers obtain the security from the dealer at the net
price of the offering which usually is at or below the most recent price
registered on the exchange. It is generally the practice of exchanges
to require members to obtain the approval of the exchange before
participating in such secondary distributions. Registration of such
distributions under the Securities Act of 1933may also be necessary.
During the year 5 exchanges reported having approved a total of
83 secondary distributions under which 6,347,361shares of stock having
an aggregate market value of $152,803,000 were sold. Of these, 78
distributions involving the sale of 6,273,290 shares having a market
value of $150,019,000 were completed, while 74,071 shares having
a market value of $2,784,000were sold in the 5 distributions which were

REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Purpose

and Nature of Registration

The statutory purpose of making available currently to investors
reliable and comprehensive information as to the affairs of companies
which have securities listed on a national securities exchange is accomplished by requiring each such company to file with the Commission
and the exchange an application for registration which discloses such
data. Unless a security is so registered pursuant to section 12 of the
act (or has unlisted trading privileges), it is unlawful to trade in the
security on the exchange. In order to keep this information up to
date, section 13 requires the filing by these companies of annual,
quarterly, and other periodical reports.
Examination

of Applications

and Reports

All applications and reports filed pursuant to sections 12 and 13
are examined by the staff to determine whether accurate and adequate
disclosure has been made of the specific types of information required
by the act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The examination under the Securities Exchange Act, like that under
the Securities Act of 1933, does not involve an appraisal and is not
concerned with the merits of the registrant's securities. ",Vhenexamination of an application or a report discloses that material information
has been omitted, or that sound principles have not been followed in
the preparation and presentation of accompanying financial data,
rhe examining staff follows much the same procedure as that developed in its work under the Securities Act in sending to the registrant
11 letter of comment, or in holding a conference with its attorneys or
accountants or other representatives, pointing out any inadequacies
in the information filed in order that necessary correcting amendments may be obtained. Here again, amendments are examined in the
same manner as the original documents. Where a particular inadequacy is not material, the registrant is notified by letter pointing out
the defect and suggesting the proper procedure to be followed in the
preparation nnd filing ot future reports, without insistence upon the
filing of an amendment to the particular document in question.
Statistics of Securities Reglstered

on Exchanges

At the close of the fiscal year, 2,20V issuers had 3,539 security issues
listed and registered on national securities exchanges. These securilies consisted of 2,575 stock issues aggregating 2,837,496,642 shares,
and 964 bond issues aggregating $19,224,375,537principal amount.
This represents increases of 182,432,292shares and $797,621,682principal amount, respectively, over the securities registered on national
secur-ities exchanges at the close of the 1947 fiscal year.
During the fiscal year 19 new issuers registered securities under the
act on national securities exchanges, while the registration of all
securities of 55 issuers was terminated, principally by reason of retirement and redemption and through mergers and consolidations. No
proceedings were instituted during the year under section 19 (a) (2)
of the act to deny, suspend, or withdraw the registration of a
security.

Rule X-12A-5 provides a temporary exemption from the registration requirements of section 12 (a) of the act to securities issued
in substitution for, or in addition to, securities previously listed or
admitted to unlisted trading; privileges on a national securities exchange. The purpose of this exemption is to enable transactions to
be Iawfully effected on an exchange in such substituted or additional
securities pending their registration or admission to unlisted trading
privileges on an exchange.
The exchanges filed notifications of admission to trading under
this rule with respect to 101 issues during the year. The same issue
was admitted to trading on IIIore than one exchange in some instances,
so that the total admissions to such trading, including duplications,

UNLISTED

TRADING

PRIVILEGES

ON EXCH.4.NGES

Unlisted trading on exchanges is of two principal varieties. The
one variety is in issues listed and registered on some other registered
exchange, in which case the public enjoys the protections afforded by
the listing and registration under the Securities Exchange Act. A
great majority of these issues are listed on New York Exchange and
admitted to unlisted trading on various exchanges in other cities. The
other variety is in issues not listed nor registered on some other registered exchange. Most of such issues are admitted to unlisted trading
on New York Curb Exchange alone. In their case the public is not
protected by any listing agreement with the issuer nor by the financial
reporting requirements of section 13, the proxy rules under section
1~, and the "trading.by insider" reporting and penalty clauses of section 16 of the Secui'ities Exchange Act, except to the extent that the
issuers or issues are registered under other acts administered by the

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Ten years ago, on June 30, 1937, the status of unlisted issues on the
registered exchanges was as follows:
Stocks listed on some other registered exchange________________________
Stocks not listed on any registered
exchange_________________________
Bonds listed on some other registered exchange________________________
Bonds not listed on any registered exchange__________________________

554
737
42
550

1,883

These issues were practically all in the section 12 (f) (1) category of
securities admitted to unlisted trading prior to March 1, 1934.
Since the first grant in April 1937 of an application by an exchange
under section 12 (f) (2) for unlisted trading in stocks listed on some
other registered exchange, there have been 524 admissions of such
stocks to the various exchanges. The number of issues involved is
less than this figure because many issues have been admitted to unlisted trading on two, three, or more exchanges. These admissions of
stocks under section 12 (f) (2) have, however, barely maintained
the number of listed stocks traded unlisted on other exchanges, which
has fallen from 554 in 1937 to 542 in 1948. The grants have tended
to make the same stocks available on numerous exchanges and to
substitute currently active stocks in offset to the many retirements of
issues originally admitted to unlisted trading under section 12
(f) (1).
Only seven stock issues have been admitted to unlisted trading on an
exchange (one of them on two exchanges) under section 12 (f) (3).
Only two of these were common stocks, and one of these has been removed from unlisted trading on New York Curb Exchange by reason
of listing on N ew York Stock Exchange.
In addition, one of the preferred stocks has become listed also on Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
Thus only five stocks, including four preferred and one common, admitted to trading under section 12 (f) (3) retain that status and are
not listed on any registered exchange.
Admissions of bonds under sections 12 (f) (2) and 12 (f) (3) have
totaled 49, but retirements have exceeded admissions, and only 20 of

bond admissions under these sections, except in case of very large, and
particularly convertible, issues.
The status of unlisted issues on the registered exchanges as of June

There has been a great disappearance of issues, in all except the first
category, from the figures of 1937. The principal shrinkage has been
in stocks and bonds not listed on any registered exchange, and this,
as has been frequently stated in these reports, was the expectation of
Congress when it authorized continuance of such privileges in 1936.
The 353 stocks admitted to unlisted trading without being listed on
.any registered exchange aggregated 354,477,579 shares, warrants, and
receipts as of June 30,1948. The reported volume of trading in these
stocks for the calendar year 1947 was 21,056,358 units, including
14,889,271 domestic shares, 3,046,387 Canadian shares, 2,312,700 war-

rants, and 808,000 American depositary receipts. The 354,477,579
unlisted shares were about 11 percent of the total 3,196,160,946shares
admitted to trading on the registered exchanges, and the 21,056,358
reported volume was a little over 4 percent of the total 512,475,639
share and warrant volume on the registered exchanges for the calendar
year 1947. Comprehensive figures with respect to issues and volumes
on exchanges will be found in appendix tables 7 to 16, inclusive.
Applications Cor Unlisted Trading Privileges

Section 12 (f) (2) of the act provides that, upon application to and
approval by the Commission, a national securities exchange may extend unlisted trading privileges to a security which is listed and registered on another national securities exchange. Pursuant to this section, and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by rule X-12F -1,
applications were granted during the year extending unlisted trading
privileges to Boston Stock Exchange in 12 stock issues; Chicago Stock
Exchange, 2 stock issues; Cleveland Stock Exchange, 1 stock issue;
Detroit Stock Exchange, 1 stock issue; Los Angeles Stock Exchange,
23 stock issues and 1 bond issue ; New York Curb Exchange, 1 stock
issue; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, 4 stock issues; St. Louis Stock
Exchange, one stock issue; San Francisco Stock Exchange, 1 stock
issue and 1 bond issue. An application of Boston Stock Exchange
involving one stock issue and an application of San Francisco Stock
Exchange involving one bond issue were withdrawn by these exchanges
after they had been advised that they did not meet the requirements
prescribed by the rule.
Section 12 (f) (3) of the act permits the Commission to grant
an exchange's application for the extension of unlisted trading privileges to a security which is not listed and registered on another national securities exchange if investors have, respecting such a security, protections equivalent to those provided for in the act regarding listed securities. An application of New York Curb Exchange
under this section was granted with respect to Cities Service Co.
3-percent sinking fund debentures, due January 1, 1977,on the ground
that equivalent protection was afforded to the public from the fact
that the common stock of the same company was listed and registered
on other national securities exchanges.
Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

During the year the exchanges filed numerous notifications pursuant to rule X-12F-2 (a) of changes in title, maturity, interest rate,
par value, dividend rate, or amount authorized or outstanding of
securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Where changes of
this nature only are effected in an unlisted security the altered security is deemed for the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act to
be the security previously admitted to unlisted trading privileges
and such privileges are automatically extended to the altered security.
However, when changes more comprehensive than these are effected
in an unlisted security, the exchange is required to file an application
with the Commission, pursuant to rule X-12F-2 (b), seeking a determination that the altered security is substantially equivalent to
the security previously admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Applications filed pursuant to this rule were granted by the Commission
with respect to one stock issue on Boston Stock Exchange; one stock
issue on Detroit Stock Exchange; four stock issues on New York
Curb Exchange; three stock issues on Philadelphia Stock Exchange:

32

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

one stock issue on Pittsburgh Stock Exchange; and one stock issue
on San Francisco Stock Exchange. The Commission denied applications of the Boston, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh Stock
Exchanges and New York Curb Exchange with respect to a total
of three stock issues.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES
Securities Delisted by Application

Section 12 (d) of the act provides that upon application by the
issuer or the exchange to the Commission, a security may be removed
from listing and registration on a national securities exchange in accordance with the rules of the exchange and subject to such terms as
the Commission deems necessary for the protection of investors.
In accordance with the procedure prescribed by rule X-12D2-1 (b),
10 issues were removed from listing and registration on exchanges
during the year. Of these, 3 issues were removed upon application
of their issuers and the remaining 7 upon application of exchanges.
In each of these instances the application was granted without the
imposition of any terms by the Commission.
Of the three issues removed upon application of their issuers, one
had not been traded on the exchange involved for a period of 6
months; the mining properties of the issuer of one had not been in operation for the past 20 years, there was no immediate prospect for
resumption of such operations, and there was an insufficient number
of shares outstanding in the hands of a very few public stockholders
to justify continuance of listing and registi ation of the issue which had
been suspended from trading on the exchange involved for the past
2 years; the remaining issue was removed from one of the two
exchanges on which it was listed and registered for the reason that the
small number of transactions effected on one of the exchanges did not
justify the expenses resulting from the maintenance of a coregistrar
and cotransfer agent and additional legal services in the State in which
the exchange was located.
The removal of the seven issues upon application of exchanges
was occasioned by various events which had the effect of practically
terminating public interest in the issues involved. These included
situations where the issuer was no longer operating; where the issuer
was in process of liquidation; where the financial condition and future
prospects of the issuer did not warrant continuation of listing and
registration of the issue; and where the number of shares of the issue
outstanding in public hands had been greatly reduced.
Securities Delisted by Certification

Securities which have been paid at maturity, redeemed, or retired in
full, or which have become exchangeable for other securities in substitution therefor, may be removed from listing and registration on a
national securities exchange uRon the exchange's filing with the Commission a certification to the effect that such retirement has occurred.
The removal of the security becomes,effective automatically after the
interval of time prescribed by rule X-12D2-2 (a). The exchanges
filed certifications under this rule effecting the removal of 227 separate
issues. In some instances the same issue was removed from more
than one exchange, so that the total number of removals, including
duplications, was 284. Successor issues to those removed became
listed and registered on exchanges in many instances.

FOURTEENTH ~~UAL

REPORT

33

In accordance with the provisions of rule X-12D2-1 (d), New
York Curb Exchange removed 15 issues from listing and registration
when they became listed and registered on New York Stock Exchange.
This rule permits a national securities exchange to remove a security
from listing and registration in the event trading therein has been
terminated pursuant to a rule of the exchange which requires such termination due to the security's becoming listed and registered and
admitted to trading on another exchange. Removal under this rule is
automatic, the exchange being required merely to notify the Commission of the removal.
Securities Removed From Listing on Exempted Exchanges

A security may be removed from listing on an exempted exchange
upon the filing by such exchange of an appropriate amendment to its
exemption statement setting forth a brief statement of the reasons
for the removal.
'
Three exempted exchanges removed 11 issues from listing thereon
during the year. The removal of these issues was occasioned by such
events as calling of the issue for redemption, dissolution of the issuer,
or substitution of a new security under a plan of reorganization.
Exempted Securities Removed From Exchange Trading

During the year Chicago Stock Exchange and New York Stock
Exchange removed from trading a total of 19 separate issues which
had been temporarily exempted from the registration requirements 0 f
section 12 (a) of the act pursuant to either rule X-12A-2 or rule
X-12A-3. One of these issues had been paid at maturity while the
remaining issues were retired in various manners under plans of
reorganization of their issuers.
MANIPULATION

AND STABILIZATION

Sections 9, 10, and 15 of the Securities Exchange Act empower the
Commission to prohibit manipulation and to regulate manipulative
devices. Section 9 of this act forbids certain specifically described
forms of manipulative activity. Transactions which create actual or
apparent trading activity or which raise or lower prices. if they are
effected for the purpose of inducing others to buy or sell. are declared
to be unlawful, Certain practices designated as "wash sales" awl
"matched orders" effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for a security are declared to be illega 1.
Persons selling or offering securities for sale are prohibited from
disseminating false information to the effect that the price of the
security will, or is likely to, rise or fall because of market operations
conducted for the purpose of raising or depressing the price
of a security. Persons selling or purchasing securities are forbidden to make false or misleading statements of material facts, wit 11
knowledge of their falsity, regarding securities for the purpose of
inducing the purchase or sale of such securities. Sections 10 and lfj
empower the Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and
prohibit the use of new forms of manipulation which the Commission
might encounter from time to time.
Pursuant to statutory authority, the Commission has adopted rules
and regulations to aid it in carrying out the expressed will of Congress.
The three above-mentioned sections, as augmented by rules and regulations, are aimed at freeing the security markets from artificial influ-

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ence, thus insuring the maintenance of fair and honest markets and
allowing prices to be established by supply and demand.
Manipulation

The Commission's purpose in its administration of the provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act against stock-market manipulation is to
provide policing of the stock exchange markets and the over-thecounter markets sufficient to accomplish the elimination of manipulative practices without interfering with the legitimate functioning of
these markets. In order to accomplish this, the Commission has continuously modified and sought to improve its procedure for the systematic surveillance of trading in securities. The methods used to detect manipulation have, of necessity, been elastic in character since
techniques employed by manipulators have changed constantly, increasing in subtlety and complexity.
The staff scrutinizes price movements in approximately 7,500 securities, including 3,500 traded on exchanges and 4,000 in the over-thecounter markets. The information maintained with respect to these
securities includes not only data reflecting the market action of such
securities but also includes news items, earnings figures, dividends,
options, and other data which might explain price and volume changes.
When no plausible explanation can be found for an unusual movement
in any security, the matter may be referred to the appropriate regional
office of the Commission for a field investigation. For reasons of
policy, the Commission keeps confidential the fact that trading in a
given security is under investigation, lest knowledge of the existence
of such investigation unduly affect the market or reflect unfairly upon
individuals whose activities are being investigated. As a result, the
Commission occasionally receives criticism for failing to investigate
situations when in fact it is actually engaged in an intensive investigation of those very matters.
The Commission's investigations in respect to matters involving
unusual market activity take two forms. The "flying quiz," or preliminary investigation, is designed to detect and discourage incipient
manipulation by a prompt determination of the reason for unusual
market behavior. Often the results of a flying quiz point to a legitimate reason for the activity under review and the case is closed. Frequently facts are uncovered which require more extended investigation, and in these cases formal orders of investigation are issued by
the Commission. In a formal investigation, members of the Commission's staff are empowered to subpena pertinent material and to
take testimony under oath. In the course of such investigations, data
on purchases and sales are often compiled covering substantial periods
of time and trading operations involving considerable quantities of
shares are scrutinized.
The Commission operates on the premise that manipulation should
be suppressed at its inception. Many of the cases investigated never
come to the attention of the public because the promptness of the
Commission's investigation, through the flying quiz technique, stops
the manipulation before it is fully developed. Since public losses are
seldom recoverable even though the perpetrator of a fraud is brought
to justice it is believed that the investigatory methods adopted afford
important protection to the public.

Stabilization

During the 1948 fiscal year the Commission continued the administration of rules X-17A-2 and X-9A6-1. Rule X-17A-2 requires the
filing of detailed reports of all transactions incident to offerings in
respect of which a registration statement has been filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 where any stabilizing operation is undertaken
to facilitate the offering. Rule X-9A6-1 governs stabilizing transactions effected to facilitate offerings of securities registered on national securities exchanges, in which the offering prices are represented
to be "at the market" or at prices related to market prices.
Of the 449 registration statements filed during the fiscal year, 199
contained a statement of intention to stabilize to facilitate the offerings covered by such registration statements. Because a registration
statement sometimes covers more than one class of security, there
were 222 offerings of securities in respect of which a statement was
made, as required by rule 426 under the Securities Act, to the effect that
a stabilizing operation was contemplated. Stabilizing operations were
actually conducted to facilitate 71 of these offerings, principally the
stock offerings. In the case of bonds, public offerings of three issues
aggregating $26,084,000in principal amount were stabilized. Offerings of stock issues aggregating 23,370,892shares and having an estimated aggregate public offering price of $335,147,302were also stabilized. In connection with these stabilizing operations, 8,579 reports
were filed with the Commission during the fiscal year. Each of these
reports has been analyzed to determine whether the stabilizing activities were lawful.
To facilitate compliance with the Commission's rules on stabilizing
and to assist issuers and underwriters to avoid violation of the statutory provisions dealing with manipulation and fraud, many conferences were held with representatives of such issuers and underwriters,
and many written and telephone requests were answered. A total
of 1,002 letters, memoranda relating to such conferences and telephone requests, and memoranda to the regional offices of the Commission wer written in connection with the administration and enforcement of the stabilization and manipulation statutory provisions
and regulations.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS OF CORPORATION INSIDERS

Under section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, section 17 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and
section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, during the
past 14 years 43,243 corporate "insiders" of more than 3,000 issuers
have filed 290,241 reports covering their transactions in and holdings
of securities of their companies. Such reports must be filed by beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of any class of an equity security
which is listed and registered on a national securities exchange; officers and directors of the issuers of any security so listed; officers and
directors of registered public utility holding companies; and officers,
directors, beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of any security
(other than short-term paper), members of advisory boards, investment advisers, and affiliated persons of investment advisers of registered closed-end investment companies. An initial report is required
of these persons showing their beneficial ownership of securities of
their companies at the time any of these relationships is assumed, and
a report setting forth purchases, sales, or other changes is required
for each calendar month thereafter in which any change in beneficial
ownership of these securities occurs.
Examination and Dissemination of Information

While, in general, the Nation's principal organized security markets
are located in the larger financial centers of the country, security
ownership, particularly of the larger issues, is divided among thousands of large and small investors scattered throughout the country. The primary purpose of security ownership reports is to make
available to investors, wherever located, information as to the transactions of insiders in their companies' securities. Members of the staff
examine all reports filed to determine their compliance with the statutory requirements, and request amended reports where inaccuracies
or omissions appear. Documents and reports filed under other sections of the various acts administered by the Commission and data
published by various financial news services must also be examined
for current information as to corporate actions involving situations
or transactions in which ownership reports must be filed. Where
any report is not received within the prescribed time, necessary steps
are taken to secure its prompt filing.
All ownership reports are available for public inspection as soon
as they are filed at the Commission's office in Washington, and in
the case of reports under section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange
Act also at the exchanges where additional copies of such reports
must be filed. Recognizing the limited opportunity of many individual investors to inspect the reports in person at 'Washington or at
the exchanges, the Commission in addition condenses the information
contained in the actual reports and publishes a monthly Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings which is mailed to any
interested person 'who requests it. This publication has a wide distribution among individual investors, security brokers and dealers,
libraries, newspapers, press associations, and others. Complete files
of this summary are available for public inspection at each of the
Commission's regional officesand at each national securities exchange.

REPORT

Preventing Unfair Use of Inside Information

Section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 aims at the
prevention of unfair use of information which may have been obtained by a corporate insider by reason of his relationship to the company. To this end, the section provides that any profit realized by
an insider from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of
any equity security of his company within a period of less than 6
months shall be recoverable by the issuer. Suit for the recovery of
such profits may be instituted by the issuer, or by any security owner
acting in its behalf if the issuer fails or refuses to bring suit within 60
days after request or if it fails diligently to prosecute the suit after
it is instituted. Similar provisions are contained in section 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and section 30 (f) of
the Investment Company Act.
Substantial amounts, ranging up to several hundred thousand dollars, have been recovered under these provisions by or on behalf of
issuers. In a number of cases voluntary payments of such profits
have been made to the company by the officer or director. Such
voluntary payments were often brought about by the necessity to
report short-term transactions. Inasmuch as the section provides for
the recovery of profits through private civil suits, the Commission
does not have the power to administer or enforce the provisions of
the section. It has, however, filed briefs as amicus curiae in many of
the suits brought in the courts, particularly where novel questions of
law have been raised for judicial determination.
As has been noted, information as to changes in ownership of securities held by persons subject to liability under section 16 (b) is required
to be furnished in reports under section 16 (a). These reports make
available to stockholders data which may indicate the existence of
liability under section 16 (b).

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES,

CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

Under three of the acts it administers-sections
14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 12 (a) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of
1940-the Commission is authorized to prescribe rules and regulations
concerning the solicitation of proxies, consents, and authorizations in
connection with securities of the companies subject to those acts. Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has adopted regulation X-14,
which is designed to protect investors by requiring the disclosure of
certain information to them and by affording them an opportunity
for active participation in the affairs of their company. Essentially,
this regulation makes unlawful any solicitation of any proxy, consent,
or authorization which is false or misleading as to any material fact
or which omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements already made not false or misleading. Under the regulation
it is necessary, in general, that each person solicited be furnished
such information as will enable him to act intelligently upon each
separate matter in respect of which his vote or consent is sought.
The proxy rules set forth in this regulation also contain provisions
which enable security holders who are not allied with the management
to communicate with other security holders when the management is
soliciting proxies.
Statistics of Proxy Statements

During the 1948 fiscal year the Commission received and examined
both the preliminary and definitive material required with respect to
1,677 solicitations under regulation X-14 as well as "follow up" material employed in 229 instances. The number of proxy statements filed
by management and nonmanagement, and the principal items of business for which stockholders action was sought in these SOlicitations,
is shown below for each of the past five calendar years.

Examination of Proxies

An example of disclosure resulting from the Commission's examination of preliminary proxy soliciting material before it is mailed in
definitive form to stockholders may be noted in the following particular case from among the hundreds processed last year. It involved solicitations by a registrant of proxies for the election of directors proposed by both the management and a minority stockholders
group. The management slate was headed by the registrant's chairman of the board of directors, who had acquired a dominating position
in the registrant's affairs as a result of the transactions described
below.
In September 1945 the chairman acquired all the common stock
and other property of company B for $200,625,of which he allocated
$150,000 as the cost of the stock. In July 1947, he transferred this
common stock to company A and received in exchange all the common
stock of company A and a promissory note of the company for $650,000 at 4 percent interest. The common stock of company B was then
the sole asset of company A. The chairman of the registrant then
sold the common stock of company A to the registrant in the same
month, July 1947. The registrant agreed to issue to the chairman,
in payment for the stock, 47,000 shares of its own common stock
having a market value of approximately $246,750. Subsequently, the
registrant assumed payment of the $650,000note of company A held
by the chairman. By reason of these transactions the chairman had
converted his original $150,000investment into stock of the registrant
worth $246.750and a promissory note for $650,000,a total of $896,750.
A former chairman of the registrant was in control of manufacturing, insurance, and investment companies which together owned
19,990 shares of the registrant's common stock (which shares were
subsequently acquired by the chairman or his associates). One of
these controlled companies, company C, had previously purchased

40

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

one of the registrant's former subsidiaries, company D, and had given
the registrant a note for $250,000 in payment. Thereafter, company
C had refused to make payments of principal or interest on this note,
asserting offsets and counterclaims against the registrant in the
amount of $500,000in connection with this transaction. Accordingly,
as a condition precedent to the exchange of the 47,000 shares of stock
of the registrant for stock of company A, general releases were exchanged between the registrant, company C and company D, with
respect to all claims arising out of the sale of company D to company
C, and the $250,000 note was canceled.
As a result of disclosures required by the Commission's staff in this
situation, the registrant's definitive proxy statement contained the
following information:
( a) Details of the arrangements entered into for the acquisition of
the shares of the registrant by its chairman or his associates from the
corporate interests of its former chairman.
(b) Details with respect to the exchange of general releases between the registrant, company C and company D related to claims
arising out of the sale by the registrant to company C of the capital
stock and accounts receivable of company D, and the relationship of
the former chairman to these companies.
( c) An indication with regard to company B that (1) its fixed
assets were reappraised after acquisition by the chairman, resulting
in a net increase of $26,038.59 over the previous depreciated carrying
value of land and buildings; (2) it has outstanding a mortgage upon
its land and buildings, in the unpaid principal amount of $105,500,
bearing interest of 4 percent a year; (3) it also has outstanding 30,000
shares of 60-cent cumulative preferred stock requiring annual dividend payments of $18,000, of which shares 5,595 were owned by the
chairman, 420 by his son, and the balance by friends and/or employees;
and (4) these interest and dividend requirements represent prior
charges on the earnings of company B before dividends may be paid
on its common stock which was acquired by the registrant. The net
income of company B for each of the past 3 years was also set forth.
The definitive proxy also disclosed, with respect to the $650,000
promissory note: (1) That if such note is not paid at maturity the
ownership of company B will revert to the chairman, since all the
common stock of company B is pledged as collateral for the note;
(2) that in connection with the issuance of such note an intangible
item of $650,000arose which now appears on the books of company B
and that the disposition thereof has not yet been determined; and
(3) that such note has resulted in an annual fixed charge of $26,000,
representing interest payments, which must be paid out of the earnings
of the registrant and its subsidiaries before any dividends may be
paid to stockholders of the registrant.
. Th~ proxy req?irements of the Securities Exchange Act operated
III this case to give stockholders of the registrant full information
about the manner in which the chairman acquired control of the
registrant, about his dealings with the registrant, and of the results
of these transactions as they affected the interests of the stockholders.

Changes in Proxy Rules

In Securities Exchange Act release No. 4037 (1947) the Commission announced the adoption of a number of changes in its proxy rules
after wide circulation of the proposals and numerous conferences with
interested persons. The fundamental purpose of the proposals was to
revise the rules to clarify their application and to write into them
more explicitly the exact situations they covel'. The response to the
Commission's invitation for comments on the revision was very generous and the comments and suggestions received were most constructive and helpful to the Commission. ~\.number of the more important
changes made are noted below.
The new rules require disclosure of the individual remuneration
paid only to the three highest-paid officersof the issner.
Follow-up material must now be filed in advance of its transmission to security holders, but this does not apply to replies to inquiries
from stockholders requesting further information or to communications requesting only that proxies previously solicited be signed and
returned. 'Vhere a proxy solicitation is made in person and written
material discussing the merits of any matter as to which the proxy is
being solicited is used, copies of such material must also be filed with
the Commission prior to its use.
The rule requiring the mailing of communications for security
holders has been clarified, particularly as to the circumstances under
which the management of the issuer is required to mail solicitation
material. The new rule also gives the management the option of
furnishing the security holder who wishes to make such a communication with a reasonably current list of security holders in lieu of mailing
his material for him. Another rule which requires the management
to include a security holder's proposal in its proxy material has been
revised to require such security holder to furnish the management with
a copy of his proposal and statement at the time he gives notice to
the management ot his intention to make the proposal at the meeting.
The revised rules became effective December 18, 1947, immediately
upon announcement of the changes, in order to permit those who wished
to do so to comply with the new rules rather than the old. However,
it was provided that any person commencing a solicitation prior to
February 15, 1948, could make the solicitation under either the old or
revised rules at his option.
During the year the Commission also had under consideration proposals to adopt amendments to the proxy rules other than those described above. These proposals were circulated by the Commission
shortly after the close of the fiscal year in Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 4114 (1948). These proposals are not as extensive as the
amendments adopted on December 1947, but they involve certain important problems. The proposed changes are noted below.
The proposals contemplate a number of changes as to the form of
proxy and the rules governing its use. To simplify the pro~y, the
changes would eliminate certain statements heretofore required to
be in the proxy. Other changes would provide that no proxy may
confer authority to vote at any annual meeting other than .the one
following the solicitation and that the proxy statement provide that
the shares covered by a proxy will be represented at the meeting and

42

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

will be voted according to the choice made by the security holder.
The purpose of these changes is to prevent the premature solicitation
of proxies on the basis of out-of-date information and to insure that
a proxy be given its full effect.
Rule X-14A-8 would be amended so that the management of an
issuer need not include the proposal of a security holder in its proxy
solicitation material where such proposal is submitted for the purpose
of enforcing a personal claim or of redressing a personal grievance
against the issuer or its management. In addition, the management
could omit a proposal if the management had included a proposal of the
same security holder in its proxy statement and the security holder
failed to attend the meeting before which the proposal was to be submitted and did not present the proposal for action. In another situation, the proposal could be omitted if the same proposal had been
submitted for action at the last annual meeting of the security holders,
or at a special meeting subsequent thereto, and received less than 3
percent of the total votes cast in regard to the proposal. Where a
management does omit a proposal, under the proposed rule, it would
have to file the proposal with the Commission together with a statement
of the reasons why the management deems such omission to be proper
in the particular case.
Schedule 14A, which states the information required to be contained in a proxy statement, would be amended with respect to item
7 (a) as to certain matters relating to the disclosure of remuneration
paid by the issuer to its officers,directors, and other persons. It would
also be amended to require information as to the indebtedness to the
issuer or its subsidiaries of associates of directors, officers, and nominees of the issuer as well as the indebtedness of such directors, officers,
and nominees. This would not include any indebtedness arising in
the ordinary course of business or to any person whose indebtedness
did not exceed $1,000 at any time durin~ the last fiscal year of the
issuer.
Item 12 of schedule 14A would be amended to make it clear that the
information required by that item must be supplied as to authorizations for securities to be issued, otherwise than in exchange for outstanding securities of the issuer, even though the securities are not
to be issued immediately. It would also be amended to provide that
a description of the securities to be authorized or issued need not be
given in cases involving only additional shares of common stock of a
class already outstanding.
REGULATION OF BROKERS AND DEALERS IN OVER-THE-COUNTER
MARKETS
Registration

Brokers and dealers using the mails or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce to effect transactions in securities on over-thecounter markets are required to be registered with the Commission
pursuant to section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, except
those brokers and dealers whose business is exclusively intrastate or
exclusively m exempt securities, The following tabulation reflects
certain data with respect to the registration of brokers and dealers
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948.

Broker-Dealer Inspections

Inspections of brokers and dealers are undertaken pursuant to section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act for the purpose of determining
whether registrants are in compliance with the requirements of law.
To a considerable extent, the inspection work is correlated with the
examination of the financial reports filed by brokers and dealers, for
when these financial reports reflect weak financial condition it is
necessary to make prompt inquiry to determine whether customers'
funds and securities are in jeopardy and whether remedial action may
be necessary or appropriate. Inspections are also frequently made as
a result of complaints made to the Commission by customers, but the
facts presented by complainants are carefully considered before any
decision is made to make an inspection as a result of their complaints.
During the 1948 fiscal year a total of 841 inspection reports were
received from the Commission's regional offices. In 24 of these inspections the question of financial condition required consideration and
continued surveillance. In 217 inspections the reports disclosed transactions at prices sufficiently different from prevailing market prices
to raise some question as to the fair treatment of customers. For the
most part, however, transactions of this type by the firms involved
were isolated and did not represent the characteristic pattern of their
business; 177 inspections disclosed information indicating noncompliance with regulation T relating to the extension of credit. In 55
inspections, questions were raised concerning noncompliance with the
rules adopted by the Commission with respect to hypothecation and
commingling of customers' securities. In only 3 inspections were
secret profits reported-transactions
in which a firm misrepresents to
customers the prices at which the customers' orders are executed.
The Commission has continued its established policy of giving
informal notice of infractions to a firm when there is no indication of
willful disregard of the law, and generally as a result of such notice

44

SECURITIES AND EXCHA~GE COMMISSION

the infractions are promptly discontinued and measures taken to prevent their recurrence. There are, of course, inspections in which acts
and practices are discovered which represent such disregard of the
interests of customers that investigations looking to appropriate action
by the Commission are undertaken. During the 19"18 fiscal year 13
such investigations were undertaken,
Administrative Proceedings

Among the sanctions which the Conunission is authorized to apply
against brokers and dealers who violate the law are revocation of
registration or denial of registration to a new applicant. The Commission may also take action to suspend or expel brokers and dealers
from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers
and from membership on national securities exchanges.

During the past 10 years a substantial number of administrative
proceedings and several criminal prosecutions against brokers and
dealers have involved the fraudulent practice OI dealing in securities
at prices not reasonably related to the prevailing market prices without
disclosure of the current market, and of confirming transactions "as
principal" when by its representations and conduct the firm in fact
acted as the customer's agent. Such practices, in part, resulted during
the 19:1:8fiscal year in the revocation of the registration of MayPhinney Co. and in the denial of registration to vVashington National
Co., Inc., controlled by Herbert R. May who had been a general partner in the May-Phinney firm and before that had operated as a sole
proprietorship under the name of Herbert R. May & CO.4 By various
artifices May sought and gained the trust and confidence of many
customers who were uninformed in securities matters and relied on his
• Securities Exchange Act release Xo. 4061 (I!H8).

FOURTEENTH ~AL

REPORT

45

representations and recommendations in the belief that he was acting
in their behalf and for their best interests. Having thus insulated
himself against any suspicion on the part of the customer, it was May's
practice to recommend that the customer purchase a particular security
at a price which he knew, but did not disclose to the customer, was far
in excess of the market price of that security and to confirm the transaction as a sale by him "as principal." Similarly, he would recommend
the sale by the customers of particular securities at prices far below
the current market prices and again would confirm the transaction as
a purchase by him "as principal."
The Commission held that, by virtue of the trust relationship cultivated by him and the understanding reached by customers from his
representations that he would act in their behalf and lor them, he was
under a duty not to deal with them for his own account (as principal)
without their express consent. Furthermore, under these circumstances, he was obligated to obtain for them the best possible prices
and to divulge all the profits he made. In violation of this duty May
took large secret profits and without disclosing; the facts charged customers prices greatly in excess of the current market prices, thereby
violating the antifraud provisions of the statutes. But even assuming
he had no duty to act as agent and assuming that he was in fact a
principal, the Commission held that these transactions would also be
fraudulent because the prices customers paid and received were not
reasonably related to the prevailing market prices. The Commission
also found that May violated the law in the sale of preferred stock of
"Washington Chemical & Salt Corp. which he organized and promoted.
This stock was sold without registration under the Securities Act in
violation of section G (a), and in the sale May made false and misleading representations with respect to the company's financial condition
and the value of its properties. This violation was all the more reprehensible because about tiO percent of the stock was sold to six widows,
uninformed customers whose trust and confidence he had cultivated
and who, from the very beginning of their dealings in securities with
May, had indicated to him their need for nonspeculative investments
which would produce a reasonable income.
In proceedings on the question of revocation of the broker-dealer
registration of Arleen ",V.Hughes, doing business as E. ",V.Hughes
& Co., the primary legal issue related to disclosures required of a
fiduciary," Mrs. Hughes, registered as both a broker and dealer and
as an investment adviser, transacted business in securities with about
175 investment advisory clients with whom she had entered into a
written contract which purported to declare the respective rights and
obligations of the parties. Under the contract Mrs. Hughes would
act as a broker or dealer and investment adviser, and it provided that
when actina as investment adviser, she should act as a principal "in
every suclt""transaction, except as otherwise agreed." The contract
-Contained a schedule of "maximum rates and charges," expressed in
points on a base-price formula, to be paid by the client on all purchases of securities. In the actual operation of her business, it was
Mrs. Huzhes' practice to handle the client's entire account, advising
the client with reference to an investment program, furnishing information and making recommendations as to particular securities,
• Securities Exchange Act releases Nos 4c048.4073, and 4080 (1948).

46

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and in connection with such recommendations she would give an approximate price that the securities would cost the client. If the client
agreed to the purchase she would either supply it from inventory or
purchase it to cover the sale and then, as principal, confirm the transaction as a sale of the security by her to the client at net price plus
insurance and postage. The Commission's staff took the position that,
because of the fiduciary relationship established by the contract, Mrs.
Hughes was under a duty in each transaction to disclose the cost of
the security to her and the best current market price. Mrs. Hughes,
on the other hand, although admitting her fiduciary relationship to
clients, contended that the disclosures made in the contract satisfied
all of her fiduciary duties and obligations. The Commission, in its
opinion and findings, held that her failure to disclose fully to her
clients the nature and extent of her adverse interest in transactions
with clients, including her cost of the security and the best price
available on a purchase in the open market, constituted a violation of
the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mrs. Hughes filed a petition with the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for review of
the Commission's order revoking her broker-dealer registration and
obtained a stay of the order pending such review.
In revoking the registration of Light, Wofsey & Benesch, Inc., and
denying registration to Light Bros., the Commission considered certain activities of Abraham Light, who was the dominant figure in both
firms and also treasurer and a director of Seco Signal Corp. which
he and his associates organized and promoted," Securities of Seco had
been sold to the public by a predecessor of Light, Wofsey & Benesch,
Inc. The evidence disclosed certain instances in which Light made or
was responsible for making express misrepresentations in offering Seco
securities. In addition, it appeared that, before various contracts for
the sale of the securities had been completed by delivery, Light and
certain of his associates in at least two transactions obtained secret
profits at the expense of Seco, At about the time of its formation Seco,
acting through Light as treasurer and director, purchased a building
and Light secretly received $500 of the commission from Herbert I.
Benesch, the agent representing the seller of the building. Later,
Light participated in the sale of electric storage batteries on behalf of
Seco which resulted in a diversion from the company treasury of
$25,000. This sum was divided among four persons, including Abraham Light, all of whom then made contributions to organize Light,
Wofsey & Benesch, Inc. and became its officers. No disclosure was
made of any of the facts relating to the diversions.
The Commission concurred in the finding of the hearing officer that
the express misrepresentations and the diversion of funds from Seco
without disclosure of the facts operated as a fraud on the public
purchasers of the company's securities by Light and his associates,
and constituted willful violations of the antifraud provisions of the"
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The specter of the bucket shop appeared in three proceedings during the year in which the Commission ordered revocation of regis• Securities Exchange Act release No. 4052 (1948).

tration," The general pattern of conduct was substantially the same
in all three instances. Customers were solicited to purchase particular
securities which the firm highly recommended, and were induced by
varying degrees of pressure and by various false representations to
enter their orders. At the time a customer agreed to effect a purchase
the firm would request payment of the purchase price, which would
be made by the customer with the understanding, of course, that the
transaction would be promptly executed. The firm, on the other hand,
would not deliver the purchased securities nor would it return the cash
it had received, but instead converted the cash paid by the customer
to its own use. Similarly, customers who delivered securities to the
firm for sale with the understanding that the proceeds of the sale
would be promptly turned over to them received neither the proceeds
nor the securities they had surrendered. Moreover, in the Bauer
proceeding the evidence showed that, contrary to the representations
in the application for registration, one D. W. Dawes, not K. L. Bauer,
was the real owner and manager of the business. Bauer, in street
jargon, was merely a front for Dawes who, as his own convenience
or necessity dictated, used various other names.
SUPERVISION OF NASD ACTIVITY
Membership

In the 1948 fiscal year membership in the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), the only national securities association registered with the Commission, increased to a year-end total of
2,677, a gain of 63 during the year. At the same date 26,228 individuals, including generally all partners, officers, traders, salesmen, and
all other persons employed by member firms in capacities which involved doing business directly with the public, were registered with
the NASD as registered representatives, an increase of 655 during the
year.
Disciplinary Actions

The Commission received reports from the NASD during the
1948 fiscal year on the dispositions of 10 disciplinary actions in which
formal complaints had been filed against members. In three of these
cases the complaints were dismissed. In the other seven cases the
appropriate district business conduct committee found that the NASD
rules of fair practice had been violated by the accused members and
imposed various penalties. The membership of one firm was suspended for 30 days; one member was fined $1,000 and censured and
another was fined $250 and censured; in two cases members were
censured and assessed costs of the proceedings; and in one case the
member was censured. The seventh case involved a complaint filed
jointly against a firm and one of its registered representatives, an
officer and employee of the firm, charging the misappropriation of
customers' funds and securities and the falsification of the books and
records of the firm to conceal the misappropriations.
The district
business conduct committee having jurisdiction found that the reg• Jamea E. Scott I! 00., Securities Exchange Act release No. 4088 (1948) ; Louia J. Burn8,
Securities Exchange Act release No. 4087 (1948) ; Kenneth Lee Bauer, Securities Exchange
Act release No. 4006 (1948).

48

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIOK

istered representatives had violated the rules as alleged in the complaint and revoked his registration as registered representative.
The
committee found no fault with the employing firm and dismissed the
complaint as to it on a finding- that the firm had brouzht to light the
alleged violations, had promptly instituted a compfete audit, had
called the matter to the attention of the appropriate authorities, and
had brought about full restitution to all customers injured by the
misappropriations.
As is its custom the Commission referred to the NASD for
appropriate action facts concerning the business practices of members
where there were indications of possible violations of the NASD rules
of fair practice. Seven such references were made in the 1948 fiscal
year and one had been in process before the NASD at the start of
that year. Reports on six of these matters were received from the
NASD during the year. Two of these involved formal complaint
procedures in which violations were found, as reported above, and in
which some penalty was imposed on the offending member. The other
four cases had been disposed of by informal means. In these four
cases the NASD undertook its own examination of the members cited
in the reference. In two cases such examination, subsequent to the
date of the facts referred to, showed a marked change in the practices
of the member following the inspection by the Commission. Consideration of such correction and improvement led to the conclusion that
no further action against the members was necessary. Independent
examinations in the remaining two cases revealed other relevant facts
or circumstances such as to convince the committees having jurisdiction
that there was no basis for formal disciplinary action.
Commission

Review of Actions on Membership

.

Under section 15A (g) of the Securities Exchange Act the Commission may review certain types of action by the NASD, including
cases wherein membership is denied to an applicant. Such cases come
hefore the Commission either on its own motion or on application by
an aggrie\'ed party. One such case, involving DeWitt Investment
Co.. camp before and was decided by the Commission during the year.
The petitioner had been denied membership on the grounds that (1)
its principal officer, Paul K. Guthrie, had been suspended from the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 1922 for conduct inconsistent with
just and equitable principles of trade, and (2) the petitioning firm
was not regularly engaged in the business of acting as a broker or
dealer in securities.
After hearing, as well as on the record made before the NASD, the
Commission held that inasmuch as the suspension by the exchange had
occurred prior to the enactment of the Securities Exchange Act it was
not a valid disqualification from membership in the NASD. On the
second point the Commission stressed that, although the petitioner
had theretofore effected only a few securities transactions, its stated
purpose with respect to business proposed to be done if given the
benefits of membership should also have been considered, particularly
in the early stages of a new venture. Consideration of the firm's past
activities and professed intention led the Commission to find that the
petitioner was actually engaged in the business of effecting transac-

00n~ in securiti~s and thus w~s not ineligible for membership under
Section 1 o! article 1 of the NASD bylaws. As required by statute
under the circumstances, the Commission by order set aside the action
of the NASD and required the NAtiD to admit the firm to membership."
Under section 15A (b) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act the Commission may be petitioned to determine whether it is in the public interest to approve or direct the admission to or continuation in membership of a firm if a partner, officer, director, or employee individually
is disqualified from membership.
Such petitions are in the first
instance passed on by the NASD which, if it acts favorably to the
applicant, becomes the petitioner before the Commission on behalf
of the applicant.
Should the NASD reject such un application, the
applicant may directly seek a Commission order direetiug the NASD
to admit or continue the applicant as a member.
The Commission gives public notice of the receipt of applications
under section 15A (b) (4) so that interested parties lllay present their
views or request public hearings. In the absence of such a request the
Commission either sets the matter down for hearing on its own motion
or decides the question on the basis of the record without hearing. In
addition the Commission will, upon request and under appropriate
circumstances, keep confidential the identity of the employing firm.
a procedure developed when it was advised that the publicity attendant
upon a Commission proceeding had discouraged some members from
taking the necessary legal steps to obtain approval of the employment
of persons under some disqualification but who, with due regard to the
public interest, might appropriately be employed under supervision
of an NASD member.
Two "approval" cases were decided by the Commission during the
1948 fiscal year and seven applications were in process or under advisement at the year end. One decision concerned Alois G. Scheidel,
held by NASD to have been a "cause" for the expulsion in 1941 of A. G.
Scheidel & Co., by and from the X ASD under circumstances which
required Commission approval or direction for the admission to or
continuation in membership of any firm with which he later became
associated. A petition was subsequently filed with the Commission by
the NASD on behalf of Minnesota Securities Corp. who then employed
Scheidel.
The NASD found the firm ineligible for membership due
to the employment of Scheidel, a disqualified person, but petitioned
the Commission to approve the admission of the firm to membership.
The Commission granted the application,"
A somewhat similar case involved John J. Bell, formerly n partner
of W. F. Thompson & Co. and a "cause" for the expulsion of that firm
by and from the NASD in 1942 for conduct inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade. Bell subsequently obtained employment
with a member firm which sought by petition to retain membership
while employing a disqualified person. As in the former case the

COMMISSION

CHANGES IN RULES AND FORMS
Rule X-3AI2-2-Exemption

for Municipally Guaranteed Securities

This rule was originally adopted to permit exchange trading without registration under the act in a security the income of which is
substantially guaranteed by a State or political subdivision thereof.
Under an amendment adopted during the fiscal year the exemption is
extended to cover the period while a company previously exempted
under the rule is in process of dissolution,"
Rule X-llD-I-Extension

of Credit by Broker-Dealers

Section 11 (d) (1) generally prohibits a broker-dealer from effecting any transaction in connection with which he extends credit to
a customer on any security which was part of a new issue in whose
distribution he participated during the preceding 6-month period.
In some cases the "new issue" subject to section 11 (d) (1) consists of
additional shares of a class previously outstanding. In such cases
old securities of the same class are not subject to the prohibition
against extending credit. As a result it may be difficult during the 6month period to distinguish between shares of the "new issue," which
are subject to the rule, and the previously outstanding shares, which
are not. A purchaser's ability to obtain credit from his broker in such
a situation would depend therefore on the particular shares which the
seller happened to deliver after the transaction. The problem was
particularly difficult where the majority of the outstanding shares
were "old" shares, not subject to the rule.
Under an amendment to rule X-llD1-1 during the year the problem
was minimized by exempting a security of a mixed class, not predominently "new," provided that the particular security was sold to or
purchased for the customer by the broker-dealer after he ceased to
participate in the distribution of the "new issue." 12 However, the
proposal does not remove the prohibition against extensions of credit
in connection with sales of "new" shares effected by a broker-dealer
during the distribution of the "new issue."
Rules X-12A-4, X-12D3-1
"When-Issued" Dealing

and X-12D3-2-Exemption

From Listing for

Holders of a security dealt in on an exchange are not afforded an
exchange market for short-term warrants or subscription rights
which have been issued to them unless such warrants or rights are
registered on an exchange or each "subject security" (the security
to be acquired by the exercise of the warrant or subscription right) is
admitted to dealing or is "in the process of admission to dealing on a
national securities exchange"; and they are not afforded an exchange
market on a "when-issued" basis for such warrants or rights which are
to be issued to them in the future, unless, among other prerequisites,
each "subject security" is "in the process of admission to dealing on
a national securities exchange."
"
The three rules in question were amended by waiving the "in the
process of admission" requirement to permit exempt trading in issued
warrants and "when-issued" dealing in unissued warrants on national

LITIGATION' UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACf
Injunction and Appellate Proceedings Involving Brokers and Dealers

Most of the court cases under the act during the year were injunction actions against brokers and dealers who either were or should
have been registered with the Commission under section 15 (a)
of the act.
Three actions against registered brokers and dealers involved the
financial responsibility of the defendants. In these three cases, SEO
v, Light, Wolsey ill Benesch, I1UJ.,et al., SEO v. Raymond, Bliss, Inc.,
and SEO v, York, the Commission's complaints charged that the defendants, in violation of the fraud provisions of the act, had accepted
money and securities from customers without advising them that the
defendants were insolvent. In addition, the Light complaint alleged
a violation of rule X-15C3--1 of the act, which prohibits a brokerdealer from permitting his aggregate indebtedness to exceed 2,000
percent of his net capital, and the Raymond, Bliss and York complaints alleged the hypothecation of customers' securities without their
knowledge or consent.
In the Light case the Commission's complaint alleged that, except
for furniture, fixtures, and certain other items which could not be
readily converted into cash, the firm's assets consisted of a total of
approximately $30 in cash and documentary stamps while it had
liabilities in excess of $5,000. After the United States District Court
at Baltimore had entered a preliminary injunction on this count, the
Commission in an administrative proceeding revoked the firm's
broker-dealer registration for violations including the insolvency
count. The revocation of the firm's registration having rendered the
court action moot, the Commission's complaint and the preliminary
injunction were thereafter dismissed without prejudice."
Both the Raymond, Bliss, and York cases were pending from the
preceding fiscal year and are described in the Thirteenth Annual Report, pages 58-59. In the Raymond, Bliss case a consent permanent
injunction was entered on the Commission's complaint during the
past fiscal year after the family of the registrant, who was deceased,
had made an assignment of $30,000for the benefit of creditors. Because of the assignment the Commission's request for the appoint:II

ment of a receiver of the firm's assets was denied. However, the
court reserved jurisdiction on the question to permit a future request
by the Commission for a receiver should developments so require."
The York case was dismissed during the past fiscal year after the
defendant had been shot and killed by his principal creditor."
A
concurrent administrative proceeding instituted by the Commission
to revoke York's registration as a broker-dealer was also thereupon
discontinued.>
Two of the injunction actions involved persons conducting a business
in securities without being registered with the Commission as required
by section 15 (a) of the act. One was SEO v, Atlas Investment 00.,
Inc., Anchor Investment 00., Inc., and John R. Jones, filed in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.
The two corporations had been engaged in the securities business in
St. Joseph, Mo., under the management and control of Jones, who was
a stockholder in both corporations.
The defendants admitted that
they had defrauded their customers by misrepresenting the prices at
which they were effecting securities transactions and by taking secret
profits. In addition it was admitted that the corporations, not having
registered as brokers and dealers, had neglected to keep proper records
and to file reports of financial condition with the Commission, and had
not given proper confirmations to their customers. The defendants
consented to the entry of a final injunction as sought by the
Commission."
The second of these actions was SEO v. Burmeister & 00., Inc.,
J. E. Burmeister; and Mail! Leiber, filed in the United States District
Court at Nashville, Tenn. The Commission in its complaint charged
that the corporation had been executing transactions in securities
without being registered as a broker or dealer with the Commission and
that the individual defendants had aided and abetted the corporation
in this violation of section 15 (a) of the act. The complaint charged
also that the defendants for several years had been selling securities
consisting of fractional undivided interests in oil and gas leases and
royalties in mineral rights in land in Texas without complying with
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. A permanent injunction by consent was entered shortly after the close of the
fiscal year.20
With respect to appellate court proceedings to review Commission
orders, only one new action was instituted during the past fiscal year.
That case is Arleen W. Hughes v, SEO, filed in the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit shortly before the close of the
fiscal year." The action is one to review the Commission's order
revoking the broker-dealer registration of Mrs. Hughes. The basis
of the appeal is that the Commission erred as a matter of law in finding
that it was a willful violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the
registrant, who was registered both as a broker-dealer under the
Securities Exchange Act and as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to sell her own securities to her investment advisory clients without fully disclosing the nature and extent

of her adverse interest. This disclosure, the Commission held, should
have included the capacity in which she acted (i. e., whether as principal or agent), the cost of securities to her, and the current market price
of the securities. The appeal alleged also that it was unlawful discrimination on the part of the Commission to treat the registrant, who
was registered as an investment adviser as well as a broker-dealer,
differently from any other registered broker-dealer in imposing duties
of disclosure.
A second appellate court action involving a broker-dealer was Lann
v. SEO, pending from the preceding year. This appeal, described in
the Thirteenth Annual Report at pages (jO-fit, was the first petition for
judicial review of a Commission finding of manipulation in the overthe-counter market. Lann was a partner of M. S.. Wien & Co., whose
registration as a broker-dealer the Commission had revoked for an
over-the-counter manipulation in violation of sections 10 (b) and
15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act and rules X-10B-5 and
X-15Cl-2 thereunder. While the court review was pending Lann
filed an application with the Commission for registration as a brokerdealer, Wien & Co. having been readmitted to registration after Lann's
separation from the firm. The Commission, in view of Lann's having
been out of business for a year and in consideration of his record both
prior and subsequent to the revocation of the registration of Wien &
Co., permitted Lann's application for registration to become effective.
Lann's petition in the appellate court to review the revocation of Wien
& Co. was thereupon dismissed."
The final appellate court review proceeding during the year was
Norris &: Hirschberq, Inc. v. SEO. an appeal from a Commission order
revoking the petitioner's registration as a broker-dealer for violation
of the antifraud provisions of the Securities and Securities Exchange
Acts. After the Commission had filed a transcript of its record in
the court of appeals the petitioner raised numerous objections to a
consideration of the case by the court upon that transcript. Some of
those objections have been discussed in the Twelfth Annual Report at
pages 35-6 and 41 and in the Thirteenth Annual Report at page 61.
During the past year an effort was again made to compel the Commission to include in the transcript of record a summary of the
evidence which it was alleged the staff had prepared for the use of the
individual Commissioners, and petitioner sought to inquire into the
decisional process of the Commission to determine how various items
in the record to which it objected were treated by the Conunission.
The petitioner filed a motion asking that a master be appointed, interrogatories framed and issued, or detailed statements concerning
these matters certified by the Commission. The court of appeals
denied the motion and denied a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The petitioner then applied to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. This too was denied," and just
before the close of the fiscal year the court of appeals heard argument
on the merits of the case.
Injunction Actions Against Persons Other Than Broker-Dealers

ing the Commission's proxy rules. This case was reported previously
in the Twefth Annual Report at page 106 and in the Thirteenth Annual Report at page 62. The action was brought by the Commission for
the purpose, among others, of compelling the defendant corporation
to resolicit proxies originally obtained as a result of solicitations
which failed to include proposals which a minority stockholder sought
to have brought before the annual meeting. These proposals were:
(1) To permit the stockholders to amend the bylaws at any annual
meeting without the requirement that such proposed amendments be
contained in the corporation's notice of meeting; (2) to hold the annual meetings in San Francisco, Calif., instead of Wilmington,
Del.; (3) to cause auditors to be elected by the stockholders and
to have a representative of the auditors last chosen attend the annual
meeting; and (4) to require that an account of the proceedings at
annual meetings be sent to all stockholders. These proposals had
been submitted to the corporation by the minority stockholder under
rule X-14A-7 (since redesignated rule X-14A-8), which provides
that, if a qualified security holder has given the management reasonable notice that he intends to present a proposal which is a "proper
subject for action" by security holders, the management shall set forth
the proposal in the proxy soliciting material and provide means
by which the security holders can vote on the proposal as required
elsewhere in the proxy rules.
The Commission supported the request of the minority stockholder
on all four proposals. The district court sustained the position of
the Commission on the proposal relating to the election of independent
auditors by the stockholders, but held for the corporation on proposals (1) and (4). Proposal (2) had become moot by the corporation's changing the place of annual meeting to San Francisco. However, the court granted the Commission's request for an order enjoining
the management from violating section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act and rules X-14A-2 and X-14A-7 thereunder."
On appeals by both sides to the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit, the district court's decision was modified to sustain the position of the Commission on the three proposals still in issue." The
court of appeals found for the Commission on the ground that (a)
each of the proposals was "a proper subject for action" by the stockholders under the law of Delaware, where the defendant was incorporated, and (b) the management's attempt to block any stockholder proposal by declining to include it in the notice of meeting
was contrary to the purpose of Congress in the Securities Exchange
Act to prevent the control of corporations by a very few persons. The
corporation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme
Court of the United States, which was denied." Thereafter, without
submitting the matter to a vote of the stockholders, the board of
directors adopted the proposals concerning the selection of the auditors
and the sending of reports to stockholders. The third proposal, designed to amend the by-law provision relied upon by the management
to preclude matters from being taken up at annual meetings, was
abandoned by its stockholder sponsor as unnecessary in the light of
the decision of the court of appeals .

Participation by the Commission in Private Actions

It is the usual practice of the Commission, where private litigation
involves questions of construction of the statutes it administers, to
seek leave of the court to express its views in a memorandum filed as
amicus curiae. One case in which the Commission filed such a memorandum during the year was Phillips v. The United Oorp., in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The Commission took the position that the court had jurisdiction to
entertain an action by a complaining stockholder for an injunction
and other equitable relief founded upon alleged violations of the Commission's proxy rules promulgated under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935,provided that the stockholder had exhausted his
administrative remedy by first bringing his complaint to the Commission for any action it might take in the exercise of its primary
responsibility tor securing enforcement of the statutes it administers.
The Commission conceded that the stockholder had satisfied this condition in the instant case, but expressed the view that the action was
without merit because: (1) To the extent that it sought invalidation
of a stockholder's vote on a management plan for the operation of
The United Corp. as an investment company after it had ceased to
be a holding cumpany, a justiciable controversy was not before the
court since the vote was without legal significance except as it might
affect future discretionary action of the Commission; and (2) to the
extent that the plaintiff sought invalidation of the election of United's
board of directors on the ground of unlawful expenditures by the management in the solicitation of proxies in violation of the Commission's
rule U-65, it did not appear from the circumstances that the rule had
in fact been violated.
The court sustained the Commission's position that such a suit could
be brought by a stockholder and indicated agreement with certain of
the other views expressed by the Commission, but denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff should be afforded an opportunity to prove certain of his charges
at a trial." Shortly before the close of the fiscal year, the issues as
to the election of directors having been made moot by their uncontested reelection at a subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, the
court stayed the cause pending such disposition as the Commission
might make of an application by the corporation for an order declaring it no longer to be a public utility holding company." Following tl1.eclose of the fiscal year an appeal was taken by the plaintiff
to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where it was heard
together with a related appeal 29 taken directly to that court under
section 24 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act with respect
to certain action of the Commission preliminary to the management's
solicitation of proxies.
There were a number of additional actions during the year, involving sections 10 (b), 14, and 16 (b) of the act, in which the Commission either participated as amicus curiae or over which close observation was maintained. In none of these were there any particularly
significant developments during the year .

m

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTiliTY
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

HOLDING

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was adopted
following an extensive investigation by the Federal Trade Commision
and after exhaustive hearings and debates by the Congress. These
inquiries disclosed a variety of abuses in public-utility holding company finance and operations which the act was designed to correct.
The more significant of these are enumerated in section 1 (b) of the
act: (1) Inadequate disclosure to investors of the information necessary to appraise the financial position and earning power of the
companies whose securities they purchase; (2) the issuance of securities against fictitious and unsound values; (3) the overloadmg of the
operating companies with debt and fixed charges thus tending to prevent voluntary rate reductions; (4) the imposition of excessive
charges upon operating companies for various services such as management, supervision of construction and the purchase of supplies
and equipment; (5) the control by holding companies of the accounting practices and rate, dividend and other policies of their operating
subsidiaries so as to complicate or obstruct state regulation; (G) the
control of subsidiary holding companies and operating companies
through disproportionately small investment; (7) the extension of
holding company systems without relation to economy of operations
or to the integration and coordination of related properties.
The act covers all holding company systems which are engaged in
the electric utility business or in the retail distribution of natural or
manufactured gas. It was particularly designed to eliminate holding
companies serving no useful purpose, and thus to afford to the operating companies the advantages of localized management and to
strengthen local regulation. This objective finds its most direct
expression in section 11 of the act. Section 11 (b) (1) requires the
operations of holding company systems to be limited to one or more
integrated systems and to such additional businesses as are reasonably
incidental or economically necessary or appropriate to the operation
uf the integrated systems. Section 11 (b) (2) requires elimination
of undue complexities in corporate structures of holding company
systems and the redistribution of voting power among their security
holders on a fair and equitable basis. The act provides also for the
registration of holding companies (sec. 5); regulation of security
transactions of holding companies and their subsidiaries (sees. 6 and
7) ; regulation of acquisitions of securities and utility assets by holding companies and their subsidiaries (sees. 9 and 10) ; regulation of
sales of public utility securities or assets, payment of dividends,
solicitation of proxies, intercompany loans and other intrasystem
trensactions (sec. 12); control of services, sales, and construction
contracts (sec. 13) ; and the control of accounting practices (sec. 15).

REPORT
UNDER

THE ACT

As of June 30, 1948, there were registered under the act 46 public
utility holding company systems comprising 73 holding and subholding companies, 309 electric and gas subsidiaries, and 323 nonutility
subsidiaries. The assets of these 705 companies aggregated approximately $14,488,000,000. On June 30,1947,52 holding company systems
had been registered, with 89 holding and subholding companies, 336
electric and gas subsidiaries and 409 non utility subsidiaries.
The
assets of those 834 companies aggregated about $15,350,000,000. The
decrease of approximately $870,000,000 in assets subject to the statute
reflects primarily the divestment of companies and properties under
section 11 modified by a substantial expansion of assets of those companies remaining under the act, as indicated below.

INTEGRATION

AND CORPORATE

SIlUPLIFICATION

UNDER SECTION II

Under standards requiring both the disposal of properties not retainable under the physical integration standards of section 11 (b)
(1) and the elimination of undue corporate complexities as required
by section 11 (b) (2), holding companies divested themselves of 39
direct subsidiaries with assets of $3,198,000,000 during the year.
Twenty-nine of these companies with assets of $1,522,000,000 were
released from the jurisdiction of the act and the remainder continued
subject to the statute.
This compares with the divestment of 31 subsidiaries with assets of $1,978,000,000 in the 1947 fiscal year, of which
number 23 companies, with assets of $870,000,000, are no longer under
the jurisdiction of the act. The total of subsidiaries divested since
December 1, 1935 is 470, with total assets of $11,312,000,000, of which
395 companies with assets of $6,972,000,000 are no longer subject to the
statute.
A complete analysis of these divestments appears in the
following tables. *
-These data include direct divestments. but not indirect divestments
'I'hus, if a subholding company and its five small subsidiaries were divested as a group in one operation
from a holding company system, the divestment table would show one company divested
with assets equal to the consolidated assets of that group of six companies.

, In the case of sales to more than 1 buyer, the company was classIfIed for the purposes oC this table in
accordance with the dISpOSitIOnof the major portion of its assets.

Viewed from the standpoint of methods of disposition employed,
the divestments of the past year have followed a pattern very similar
to that of the 1947 fiscal year. Reflecting continuation of the less
favorable markets for equity securities which have prevailed since
the latter part of 1946, only four divestments were accomplished during the 1948 fiscal year by means of public offerings for cash. These
involved common stock of the following companies:
Detroit Edison Co.
Northern Natural Gas Co.
Public Service Co. of New Mexico.
American Water Works Oo., Inc.

Both the Detroit Edison and the Northern Natural Gas common
stocks had previously enjoyed good markets, which facilitated their
distribution. The American Water Works stock was sold subject to
the prior exercise of subscription warrants and exchange rights.
Five divestments were effected by means of sales to cooperatives or
public utility districts, 14 represented sales to other utilities, and 3
were private sales to individuals. The great bulk of the divestments
took the form of outright distributions to security holders of the parent companies or of exchanges.
Stocks of the following companies were distributed directly to the
common stockholders of the parent company:
Central Illinois Public Service Co. by Middle West Corp.
Conowingo Power Co. by Susquehanna Utilities Co.
East Coast Electric Co. by East Coast Public Service Co.
El Paso Electric Co. by Engineers Public Service Co.

These data do not include a number of indirect divestments. In
addition, simplification has resulted also from merger or consolidation
of companies and many companies have been released from the jurisdiction of the act by exemption. Thus, the over-all reduction in the
number of companies subject to the act is much greater than has been
indicated. From June 15, 1938, to June 30,1948, a total of 2,145 companies had become subject to the act, whereas on June 30, 1948, only
714 remained thus subject. Two hundred and forty-nine companies
were absorbed by merger or consolidation, 889 were sold, dissolved, or
otherwise divested, and 149 were released from jurisdiction of the ad
by exemption under section 3 or declarations of status under sections
2 and 5. The following tables present the record for the entire period

The changes in the aggregate assets of holding company systems
subject to the act have not been as pronounced during the past 10
years as the sharp reduction in the number of companies. Comparable data for the smaller companies and for nonutility companies
have not been assembled for the earlier years, but an analysis has
been made of electric and gas subsidiaries with assets of $5,000,000
or over. This group constitutes the bulk of all assets subject to the
act.
From December 31, 1938 to June 30, 1948, a total of 276 companies
in this category had become subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.
On December 31, 1938, these companies had aggregate assets of approximately $14,000,000,000. Ninety-two with assets of $4,100,000,000
on that date have been released from the jurisdiction of the act by
divestment 1 or otherwise," One hundred and eighty-four companies,
with assets of $9,900,000,000on December 31, 1938, remained subject
to the act. The 92 companies released from the jurisdiction of the
act ultimately contracted by merger or consolidation into 62 companies by June 30, 1948, with assets of about $5,000,000,000.3 The
184 companies still subject to the act became 155 companies by June
30, 1948, with assets of approximately $11,000,000,000.3 Overall, the
276 companies originally subject to the act contracted in later years
by merger or consolidation (but not by divestment) into 217 companies on Jtme 3C2t
1948,with assets of approximately $16,000,000,000.3

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

While, in past years, substantlal emphasis has been placed upon the
divestment of nonretainablc assets of holding companies, activlt has
centered also around retainable properties which are being h i t t e l i n t o
integrated systems subject to the Commission's continuing jurlsdlction.
Divested companies remaining subject to the act have been fitted either
into new integrated systems created from suitable portions of the
old systems or into entirely different systems with which integration
of the divested properties is found to he feasible. Thus the reorganization of the former system of American Water w o r k s & Electric
Co., Inc. involved the segregation of the utility and miscellaneous
properties under The West Penn Electric Co., a former subsidiary
whch now is a top registered holding company under the act. The
Commonwealth & Southern Corp. reorganization has produced the
formation of The Southern Co., a registered holding company whose
subsidiaries comprise the former southern utility properties of the
old parent company. The so-called "Central System" of American
Gas 6; Electric Co. system is being developed as an integrated utility
system through various purchases and sales of properties, thus requiring the parent to remain registered as a holding compan
Numerous
other systems such as Central and South West Corp., 6olumbia Gas
Sgistem, Inc., Consolidated Natural Gas Co., and New E n land Electrlc System might also be mentioned in this connection. gome problems of integration remain in many of these systems, hut i t is now
r e a d i l ~apparent that a substantial number of new integrated systems
are in the mak~ng.
STATUS OF INTEGRATION AND SIMPLImCiTION PROGRAMS

There has been activity during the 1948 fiscal year in nearly all of
the public-utility holding company systems suhject to the act. Principal developments, hower-er, occurred in the following 15 systems.
which are described in this section:
American Gas & Electric Co.
Cities Service Co.

New England public service Co.
The North American Co.
Oeden Corn.

American Gas & Electric Co. (American Gas) has proceeded during
t h e p t f i s c a l ~ e a with
r
the divestment of its common stock holdings
in tlantlc Clty Electric Co. (Atlantic City). This constitutes the
only remaining holding which the Commission has held to be not
retainable by t.his company under section 11. I n September 1947

stock holdings in Atlantic City, by a sale to underwriters.' An additional448,232 shares has since been distributed as dividends by American Gas up to June 30, 1948. It is anticipated that similar stock dividend payments will complete the divestment of this holding by the
close of 1948.
In April 1948Indiana Service Corp., a subsidiary of American Gas,
disposed of its transportation properties in Fort Wayne as required
by previous order of the Commission," Indiana Service Co. has since
been merged, with Commission approval, into another subsidiary,
Indiana & Michigan Electric CO.6
On August 19, 1948,approval was given to the acquisition by American Gas of the common stock of Citizens Heat, Light & Power Co.
(Citizens) of Indiana from United Public Utilities Corp.' It was
found that this acquisition tended toward the economical and efficient
development of the so-called Central System. The approval was conditioned, however, so that American Gas was required to dispose of
Citizens' water properties within 1 year from the acquisition date.
Cities Service Co.

Cities Service CO.'s (Cities) plan of corporate simplification filed
pursuant to section 11 (e) was consummated in June 1947. Under
that plan, new debentures were issued by Cities to holders of its outstanding preferred and preference stocks in a principal amount equivalent to their redemption prices plus accumulated dividend arrears,
the latter totaling approximately $50,000,000. Provision was also
made for the immediate retirement of about 40 percent of outstanding
long-term debt and for application of anticipated proceeds from the
disposition of utility subsidiary companies to the retirement of the
remaining long-term debt and to the reduction in the amount of new
dehentures.
Federal Light & Traction Co. (Federal), a subsidiary holding
company of Cities, was liquidated in October 1947 pursuant to a plan
filed under section 11 (e). The plan was approved on September 11.
1947,Sand provided, in part, for the immediate cash payment to preferred stockholders of the stated value ($100) of their stock plus
accrued dividends and for a pro rata distribution to the common stockholders of shares in Public Service Co. of New Mexico (Public Service) and Federal Liquidating Corp., the latter formed as a vehicle
for consummating the plan. The common stockholders of Federal also
received an $11 per share cash distribution. An amount of cash covering the call premium on the outstanding shares of preferred stock
was placed in escrow pending a determination of any additional
amounts to which the preferred holders may be entitled. Reservation of jurisdiction over this matter was expressly ordered. In April
1948, Cities disposed of its interest in the common stock of Public
Service Co. of New Mexico, acquired by reason of the liquidation of
Federal. Disposition was made by sale at competitive bidding,"
An application was filed in May 1948 by Arkansas Natural Gas

involves the creation of two new corporations to which are to be

producing properties, respectively, now owned by Arkansas LOUIsIana
Gas Co. (Ark-Lou), a subsidiary of Arkansas. The capital stocks of
the new corporations are to be acquired by Ark-Lou and distributed to
its parent, Arkansas. This will leave Ark-Lou owning only gas distribution properties. After these transactions are completed all of the
capital stock of Ark-Lou will be sold by Arkansas. Hearings on the
application have not yet been concluded.
The Commonwealth & Southern Corp.

On August 1, 1947,'0the Commission approved a plan, filed as a
part of this company's over-all program under section 11, providing,
in substance, for the transfer by Commonwealth of all of its interest
in four southern operating companies to a new holding company, The
Southern Co. (Southern). On the same date, pursuant to the standards of section 11 (b) (1), the Commission required the divestment
from the Commonwealth holding company system of its northern subsidiaries, South Carolina Power Co., and its interest in the nonelectric
properties of the aforesaid four southern operating subsidiaries. In
connection with this plan Commonwealth had agreed to dispose of all
its interests in subsidiary companies, other than those transferred to
Southern, and to dispose of its interest in Southern after the retirement
of Commonwealth's preferred stock.
In accordance with Commonwealth's agreement, a new plan under
section 11 (e) was filed by Commonwealth on July 30, 1947,11 It provided, briefly, for: (a) The retirement of all of its outstanding preferred stock by the distribution in exchange therefor of its portfolio
common stock holdings in two subsidiaries, Consumers Power Co. and
Central Illinois Light Co.; (b) the distribution of Commonwealth's
remaining assets to the holders of its common stock; (c) the cancellation of Commonwealth's option warrants; and (d) the dissolution of
Commonwealth.
Hearings on the plan were instituted in October 1947 and concluded
in January 1948. Subsequently, representatives of substantial
amounts of Commonwealth's preferred and common shareholders
offered a "compromise proposal" which would alter somewhat the
ratios of stock allocation and the amount of cash payment to the preferred stockholders. On June 11, 1948, the staff of the Division of
Public Utilities filed its proposed findings and opinion in which it
found that the plan as filed was unfair to the preferred stockholders
since it did not adequately compensate them for the surrender of their
rights. It was stated, however, that the plan could be found fair if
it were amended in a manner consistent with suggestions in the "compromise proposal." On July 7, 1948,Commonwealth amended its plan
in a manner deemed by the company to be consistent with the "compromise proposal" and the staff's proposed findings. The hearings
were reopened on the amended plan, further evidence taken, and the
record closed. The case is now before the Commission for its decision.
During the fiscal year there have been various divestments from the
Commonwealth holding company system pursuant to the terms of
the statute. Commonwealth's interest in South Carolina Power Co.

Electric Bond & Share Co.

Electric Bond & Share Co. (Bond & Share) is continuing its program of reducing its holdings of utility stocks. looking toward the
final divestment of all such investments in the United States and its
emergence as an investment company. Bond & Share presently has
four major subholding companies: American & Foreign Power Co.,
Inc. (Foreign Power) ; American Power & Light Corp. (American);
Electric Power & Light Corp. (Electric) and National Power & Light
Co. (National). American Gas & Electric Co., formerly a subholding
company, ceased to be a statutory subsidiary of Bond & Share in March
1947.18
The plan of reorganization of Foreign Power was discussed in
findings issued by this Commission on November 4, 1947/9 and approved on November 19, 1947,20after the filing of certain modifications.
Application was then made to the United States district court for
enforcement. Under the plan, Foreign Power's corporate structure,
presently consisting of two classes of debt securities, three series of
preferred stock, common stock, and option warrants to purchase common, would be recapitalized and simplified bv the issuance and substitution of two debenture issues and common stock. On September
16.1948, the court entered its decision approving the plan as submitted.
During November 1947, American, which is largest of the four
Bond & Share subholding companies, advised the Commission that
market conditions were such that its then pending plan was no longer
feasible and that it proposed to file a new plan for disposition of its
assets and readjustment of the rights of its security holders. The
new plan pursuant to section 11 (e) was filed jointly by American
and Bond & Share on April 8, 1948.21 In general, the plan proposes
the distribution, directly or indirectly, by American to its preferred
and common stockholders of all its assets. Specific allocations of
American's assets to its preferred and common stockholders were not
included in the plan as filed. The joint applicants were not in agreement, at the time of filing, on such allocation. But the two companies expect to reach agreement after the conclusions of hearings
on the application or to file separate amendments containing their
individual allocation proposals at that time. Bond & Share has indicated that within 1 year after the effective date of the plan it will

dispose of any securities received by it from American under the
plan. Hearings before the Commission are presently in progress on
this plan.
Electric, another subholding company of Bond & Share, also withdrew the section 11 (e) plan which it had on file with the Commission
because of changes in market conditions. A new four-part plan
was filed jointly by Electric and Bond & Share on March 25, 1948.22
The plan provides for the transfer to a new company of securities
of four of Electric's subsidiaries which operate in the Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana area. Electric will receive the common stock
of the new company, which will register as an electric utility holding
company. Provision is also made for the settlement of claims against
Bond & Share and its subsidiaries by the payment of $2,200,000to
Electric. The third part of the plan contemplates an allocation of
Electric's common-stock holdings in United Gas Corp. and the new
holding company to the existing classes of preferred stock to effect a
retirement of these shares. Finally, Electric is to be dissolved and its
assets, consisting of the remaining shares of its holdings in United
Gas Corp. and the new holding company, will be distributed among
the common stockholders. Hearings on this program have been
closed, briefs filed, and oral argument held. The matter is now
before the Commission.
National, the fourth subholding company of Bond & Share, has
already disposed of substantially all of its interests in utility subsidiaries. The consolidated book assets of this holding company have
contracted from a figure of $570,000,000at the date of mitial registration with the Commission to approximately $45,000,000at the present
time. In 1947, National filed an amended plan under section 11 (e)
for the reorganization of Lehigh Valley Transit Co. (Lehigh), largest
of its remaining subsidiaries. This is a further step looking toward
the final distribution of National's remaining assets and its complete
liquidation. Under this plan Lehigh would retire its outstanding
bonds with cash or the delivery of Pennsylvania Power & Light Co.
41;2percent preferred stock shares. The preferred stock of Lehigh
would be retired by cash payment to the public holders and the
issuance of new common shares for those preferred shares held by
National. Additional new common would be issued to replace the
old common, publicly held, on a share-for-share basis. This plan was
approved with some modification by the Commission after the close
of this fiscal year 23 and the application for enforcement in the district
court has also been approved.
Engineers Public Service Co., Inc.

. Engineers Public Service Co., Inc. (Engineers) has progressed with
Its program under section 11 to the point where its consolidated assets

court. On May 15, 1947, that court disapproved a par~ of the plan
calling for the payment of the full voluntary redemption prices III
retiring Engineers' preferred stocks. However, it permitted consummation of the plan by the payment of $100 plus accrued dividends to
the preferred holders and the escrowing of an amount sufficient to
cover the difference between the involuntary liquidation price and
the voluntary redemption prices in the event that it should be determined on appeal that the preferred stockholders were entitled to
the larger amounts.
On appeal from the decision of the district court, the circuit court
of appeals on March 19, 1948, expressed agreement with the district
court's conclusion that the plan of reorganization for Engineers was
unfair and inequitable, but vacated that court's order, upon the ground
that the district court should have entered an order disapprovmg the
plan originally submitted to it, instead of modifying the plan as it
had done."
On August 23, 1948, since the close of the fiscal year, this Commission has petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a review of
the final order of the third circuit court. The Supreme Court has
granted certiorari.
International Hydro-Electric System

This company (IRES) is presently under order of the Commission
to liquidate and dissolve. On September 12, 1947, a plan toward this
end was approved. The plan provided for the payment by IHES to its
debenture holders of 30 percent of the principal amount of its outstanding debentures." The plan also received approval of the district
court and has been consummated.
Additional plans providing for the complete liquidation of
IHES have been filed by a number of parties,including the trustee for
the company and various security holders. However, one such holder
contends that due to changing circumstances the Commission's order
for dissolution of the company should be altered to one requiring only
its reorganization. Extended hearings on all such plans have been
conducted since October 1947 and were not yet concluded at the close
of the fiscal period.
The IHES holding company system has already been substantially
contracted. At the time of initial registration there were 66 direct
and indirect subsidiaries as against 10 at the close of the fiscal year.
Consolidated assets likewise show a reduction of approximately
$400,000,000.
The Middle West Corp.

In May 1947 the management of the Middle West Corp. (Middle
West) deemed it advisable for the benefit of stockholders to dissolve
the corporation. It presented an appropriate resolution to its stockholders who, in August 1947, voted in favor of this decision. Middle
West has filed no overall plan of dissolution but has taken a number of
steps tending toward that result. Its common stock holdings in

(North West), approved by the Commission on December 31, 1947,29
was also carried to completion after receipt of the district court order
of enforcement in March 1948. This plan, filed under section 1~ (e),
provided for the distribution of cash and common shares of WIsconsin Power & Lisrht Co. in exchange for the publicly held shares of
North West preferred stocks. The remaining assets of North West
consisting of additional common shares of .Wisconsin Power & Light
Co. plus cash were distributed to Middle West. Dissolution of North
West is anticipated as soon as practicable.
New England Public Service Co.

In connection with the plan of reorganization described in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the Commission instituted enforcement proceedings in the district court and, on August 6, 1947, the court approved
the plan and ordered it carried out." Thereafter, New England
Public Service Co. elected to go forward with one of the alternative
procedures permitted by the plan and gave notice of its adoption of
the so-called "alternative 1," which gave to the prior lien preferred
stockholders of New England Public Service Co. the option to take
common stock of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire in lieu of cash.
On September 15, 1947, the Commission approved the adoption of
alternative 131and the plan has been carried out to the extent of the
retirement of all of the prior lien preferred stock of New England
Public Service Co. by the payment of $100 per share plus accrued dividends and the issuance of certificates of contingent interest. Accrued
dividends included substantial amounts of arrearages on both classes
of prior lien preferred. The certificates of contingent interest represent the holders' claims, as yet of undetermined value, to call premiums on the retired preferred shares.
A parent of New England Public Service Co., Northern New
England Co., which owns 32.5 percent of the former company's common stock and is also a respondent in the section 11 (b) (2) proceedings instituted by the Commission, filed on January 30, 1948, a voluntary plan for its partial liquidation, which plan was still pending at
the close of the fiscal year.
The North American Co.

The section 11 (e) dissolution plan of Washington Railway & Electric Co. (Washington Railway), a subsidiary of the North American
Co. (North American), was consummated in the fall of 1947. North
American, by reason of its holdings of common stock of 'Washington
Railway, acquired directly 2,073,113 shares of common stock of Potomac Electric Power Co. (Potomacj
and 106,456 shares of capital
stock of Capital Transit CO.33 By the end of the fiscal year, North
American had disposed of all of its holdings of the common stocks of
Potomac and of \Visconsin Electric Power Co. (Wisconsin Electric),
constituting about 60 percent and 84 percent, respectively of the outstanding common stock of these companies."

After approval by the Commission of the amended section 11 (e)
dissolution plan for North American Light & Power Co. (Light &
Power}," the District Court of the United States for the District of
Delaware entered its order enforcing the plan." The plan has been
consummated as to the public preferred stockholders of Light & Power
but certain common stockholders have appealed from the decree of the
court, and this appeal is now pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit." In December 1947, Light & Power sold its
entire holdings of common stock of Northern Natural Gas Co. by
competitive bidding."
North American remains with Light & Power, Union Electric Co.
of Missouri, and several minor nonutility subsidiaries. Under the
plan for the dissolution of Light & Power, North American will
acquire directly all the common stock of the Kansas Power & Light
Co. and Missouri Power & Light Co., and up to approximately 35
percent of the common stock of Illinois Power Co. These holdings
are required to be divested under the Commission's order of April
14, 1942, which requires that North American sever its connections
with all subsidiaries except Union Electric and 60 Broadway Building
Corp.
Ogden Corp.

Since the initial registration of Utilities Power & Light Corp.,
predecessor of Ogden Corp. (Ogden), consolidated assets of this system have been reduced from approximately $314,000,000to less than
$10,000,000at the close of the fiscal year.
On July 29, 1947,39an amended plan pursuant to section 11 (e) was
approved which provided for the liquidation and dissolution of
Ogden's subsidiary, Central States Utilities Corp. (Central Utilities),
and the latter's subsidiary Central States Power & Light Corp. (Central States). Under the plan cash payments were made to the debt
holders and the preferred stockholders of Central States other than
Ogden and to the bondholders of Central Utilities other than Ogden.
The residual net assets of both companies were transferred to Ogden
Corp. Court approval of the plan was obtained on October 28, 1D47,
and liquidation of the two subsidiaries was commenced in April 1948.
Another subsidiary of Ogden completed an urgently needed financial reorganization during the past year. This action was taken after
the Commission approved the sale of new bonds, debentures, and common shares by Interstate Power Co. to retire its outstanding mortgage
debt.40 An amount of unsold common shares was placed in escrow in
favor of the holders of Interstate's securities junior to the first mortgage bonds. This reorganization of Interstate constitutes a necessary
step prior to the disposition by Ogden of its interest in the company.
On August 3, 1948, an order was entered by the Commission pursuant to section 5 (d) stating that Ogden has ceased to be a holding
company. The order was made subject to certain conditions, however, which were necessary for investor protection in connection with

Standard Power & Light Corp.-Standard

Gas & Electric Co.

On October 3, 1947, Standard Gas & Electric Co. (Standard Gas)
HIeda plan to dispose of its holding of stock in a subsidiary company
and to accomplish other corporate changes. The plan was not approved unanimously by all directors and two dissenting members of
the board submitted a separate plan.
Shortly thereafter, on October 8, the Commission permitted a
declaration to become effective allowing a protective committee for
$7 and $6 cumulative prior preference stock of Standard Gas to
solicit all such holders in connection with the reorganization of
Standard Gas.42 This protective committee, on October 23, filed a
petition which, among other things, requested that the Commission
act to prohibit the holding of the annual meeting of stockholders of
the company, the solicitation of proxies by Standard Gas for this
meeting, and the election of directors for Standard Gas. The committee further requested the Commission to apply, under section 11
(d), to a court and to petition the court to appoint the Commission
as trustee to hold and administer the assets of Standard Gas. It was
also requested that the plan of the company, filed October 3, be dismissed.
A memorandum opinion and order of the Commission dated October
30,1947, pointed out that the company plan was vague and indefinite
and Standard Gas was required to show cause why the plan should
not be dismissed." In addition, Standard Gas was prohibited from
soliciting proxies for the annual meeting unless prior approval of
the Commission was received; Standard Gas, its parent Standard
Power & Light Corp. (Standard Power), and their respective affiliates were prohibited from entering into new contracts without
giving the Commission 10 days' notice of such intention; and pending
the conclusion of hearings, Standard Power was prohibited from voting its stock holdings in Standard Gas. Standard Gas was directed
also to show cause why it should not be ordered to liquidate or recapitalize on a one-stock basis.
Standard Gas subsequently filed a declaration regarding its proposal to solicit proxies for the annual meeting and a consolidated
hearing was held to consider the matter specified in the Commission's
memorandum opinion and order of October 30, 1947. While the hearings were in progress the Commission postponed the annual meeting 44and subsequently, in its findings and opinion of February 17,
1948, permitted Standard to solicit proxies in connection with this
deferred annual meeting. Permission was conditioned so as to require Standard Gas to send a copy of the Commission's opinion to
each stockholder. at. the time of solicitation." In permitting this
action the Commission took note of a program of action, approved
by the board of Standard Gas on February 4, 1948, which included
the following steps: (1) Selection of a new chief executive to serve

amendment of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws to provide
for an increase in the board of directors from eight to nine members
of whom three would be elected by holders of prior preference stock;
(3) immediate consideration by the new board of steps to be taken
to comply with section 11 of the act; (4) selection of new counsel
for purposes of the section 11 proceedings; and (5) consent by the
company to the entry of an order by the Commission pursuant to
section 11 (b) (2) of the act requiring the dissolution and liquidation
of Standard Gas or its recapitalization on a one-stock basis. On
March 1, 1948, the Commission ordered the hearing reconvened to
consider what action should be taken by Standard Gas to effect compliance with section 11 (b) (2) of the act," A hearing has been
held on this issue and the Commission has the matter under advisement.
The Philadelphia Co., a registered holding company and a subsidiary of Standard Gas, was ordered by the Commission on June 1,
1948, to dispose of its gas and transportation properties and, after
completion of such dispositions, to liquidate and dissolve." At present the system of the Philadelphia Co., aggregating $370,000,000in
assets, supplies electric, gas, and transportation services in the city of
Pittsburgh, Pa., and its surrounding area. Petitions for rehearing,
filed by Philadelphia Co., certain of its subsidiaries, and Standard
Gas were denied by the Commission on June 30, 1948.48 An appeal to
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has been taken
by Philadelphia Co. and Standard Gas since the close of the fiscal year.
Philadelphia Co. has also presented a plan of reorganization of its
gas properties in Pennsylvania, and this plan was approved by the
Commission on June 30, 1948.49 Under the plan, all the gas properties
of the Philadelphia Co. and its subsidiaries located in Pennsylvania
will be brought under the ownership of Philadelphia Co.'s present
subsidiary, Equitable Gas Co. Equitable Gas Co. is being recapitalized so that its outstanding securities will consist only of first mortgage bonds and common stock, the latter to be owned by Philadelphia
Co. To this end, Equitable Gas Co. recently completed the sale of
$14,000,000of mortgage bonds and transferred the proceeds to Philadelphia Co. in payment for the gas properties received from that company. The Commission's order approving these transactions required
that the proceeds received by Philadelphia Co. be applied solely to
the reduction of its own outstanding debt.
On October 28, 1947,the Commission approved a section 11 (e) plan
of Louisville Gas & Electric Co. (Delaware), another subsidiary of
Standard Gas.50 The plan provides for the distribution by that company of its common-stock holdings in Louisville Gas & Electric Co.
(Kentucky) and subsequent dissolution of the Delaware company.
The distribution of these holdings, which constitute the Delaware company's principal asset, is to be made in the ratios of 1Y1.4 shares of the

shares of Kentucky are to be disposed of as soon as the dissolution of
the Delaware company is accomplished.
. .
.
Following its approval of the plan, the Commission applied to a
Federal district court for enforcement of the plan. On May 13, 1948,
the court remanded the case to the Commision in view of the court's
opinion, contrary to that of the Commission, that the class A stock
of the Delaware company has the right to cumulative dividends."
Despite the court's different view on this point it nevertheless found
rhe plan to be fair and equitable. Since the close of the fiscal year
the Commission held oral argument on the cumulative feature and in
supplemental findings reaffirmed its previous order, finding that the
proposed allocations were still within the range of fairness." Upon
subsequent application for enforcement by the Commission the court
issued its order providing that the plan be made effective on September 3,1948.
Hearings were ordered and, since the close of the fiscal year, have
been held on the section 11 (e) plan of Market Street Railway Co.
(Market Street), a nonutility subsidiary company of Standard Gas.
Included in the plan is an agreement among Standard Gas, Market
Street, and a committee of prior preference stockholders designed to
settle the open account indebtedness owed to Standard Gas by Market
Street and pending litigation with respect thereto. It also provides
for the settlement of other claims, distribution of remaining assets to
the holders of its prior preference stock, and the dissolution of Market
Street.
The United Corp.

The United Corp. (United) owned substantial amounts of the common stock of four major subholding companies: Public Service Corp.
of New Jersey (Public Service), Columbia Gas System, Inc. (Columbia), the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. (Cincinnati), and Niagara
Hudson Power Corp. (Niagara Hudson).
On August 14, 1943, the Commission issued an order under section
11 (b) (2) directing that United change its existing capitalization to
a single class of common stock and cease to be a holding company."
The Commission having subsequently approved two voluntary exchange plans for United's preference stock 54 under the terms of which
approximately 54 percent of that stock was eliminated, United filed, in
July 1947, a plan under section 11 (e) for the mandatory retirement
of the remaining shares in exchange for a package of $6 in cash, one
share of common stock of Public Service Electric & Gas Co. (PEG)as reorganized according to the plan described in the following paragraph-one share of common stock of Columbia, one-fourth of a share
of common stock of Cincinnati, and one-tenth of a share of common
stock of South Jersey Gas Co. (South Jersey). On April 9, 1948,
after appropriate hearings, the Division of Public Utilities filed its
recommended findings and opinion recommending approval of the
plan if modified in certain minor aspects, which include the elimination

and small size of that company and the fractional mterest to be dIStributed. On August 9, 1948, the plan was approved after being
amended by the company in accordance with modifications indicated by
the Commission in its previously issued findings and opinion. Application has been made to the appropriate court for enforcement of the
Commission's order, arguments have been heard, and the matter has
been taken under advisement.
PEG was one of three public-utility subsidiaries of Public Service
Corp. of New Jersey which, together with a transportation holding
company subsidiary, made up the Public Service subholding company
system. Pursuant to a plan approved by the Commission 55 and enforced by the district court on December 30, 1947, and March 19, 1948,
respectively, the ownership of the transportation holding company
was transferred to PEG, the holders of perpetual certificates of Public Service received debentures of PEG in exchange, the public holders of Public Service noncallable preferred received PEG preference
stock in exchange, and the common stock of PEG and another subsidiary of Public Service, South Jersey Gas Co., was distributed to the
common-stock holders of Public Service. The third utility subsidiary
of Public Service was sold to nonaffiliated interests. 56
The Columbia Gas System, Tnc., formerly Columbia Gas & Electric
Corp., has divested itself of its electric utility subsidiaries 57 and now
comprises, except for a minor part of the system, only gas utility and
related properties which the Commission had declared to be retainable.
Niagara Hudson, another of United's subholding companies, owns
all the common stock of Buffalo Niagara Electric Corp., Central New
York Power Corp., and New York Power & Light Corp., and, directly
or indirectly, of seven smaller companies. Niagara Hudson has on
file with the Commission two plans under section 11 (e) looking
toward its elimination as a holding company. The first plan, filed
May 19, 1948, provides for the consolidation of Niagara Hudson's
three major subsidiaries. Under the provisions of the plan the debt
of the three companies will be assumed by the consolidated company
and the holders of preferred stocks of the three companies will receive
in exchange therefor preferred stock of the consolidated company.
Niagara Hudson, which owns all the outstanding shares of common
stock of the three companies, will receive the common stock of the
consolidated company. A hearing on this plan was held on June 29,
1948. Proceedings are also pending concerning the merger of two of
the seven smaller subsidiaries of Niagara Hudson, Northern Development Corp., and Union Bag & Paper Power Corp., into two of the
companies which are to be consolidated, either before or after
consolidation.
On June 23 1948, Niagara Hudson filed the second plan, which
provides that Niagara Hudson will substitute 3 percent debentures,
maturing 10 years from the date of issue, for its outstanding preferred stock and will distribute to its common stockholders for each
share of its common stock tendered together with a cash payment of
$7.50 one share of common stock of the consolidated company. Under
the plan, net income of Niagara Hudson and cash received by it in

the exchange will be applied to the payment of the bank loans of
Niagara Hudson presently outstanding in the amount of $21,370,000.
Niagara Hudson will accept for exchange its new debentures at face
value in amounts up to $4: per share toward payment of the $7.50.
The offer will remain open until all bank loans and debentures are
retired through application of the funds received from stockholders
and from corporate net income. Upon the retirement of the debentures, Niagara Hudson will distribute the remaining shares of common stock of the consolidated company to the remaming holders of
common stock of Niagara Hudson on a share-for-share basis, transfer
all its remaining assets to the consolidated company, and thereafter
Niagara Hudson will dissolve. While the plan is still formally on
file, discussions are being held with respect to revisions therein.
The United Light & Railways Co.

On December 31, 1947, the Commission approved a plan filed by
the United Light & Railways Co. (Railways) and its subsidiary
American Light & Traction Co. (American) which proposes that
Railways will dispose of its interest in American and in any stocks
transferred by American to it. American will continue to operate a
separate integrated gas production, transmission, distribution, and
storage system."
Details of the plan include, in part, the following procedures.
_ American will continue as parent company of a gas utility system
including a group of pipe line and gas distribution subsidiaries, but
will dispose of its holdings in Detroit Edison Co. and Madison Gas and
Electric Co. by public sale or distribution to its stockholders. In this
connection it is noted that, up to June 30,1948, American had already
disposed of 969,160shares of common stock of Detroit Edison by sales
at competitive bidding or as dividends on its common stock. Proceeds
from the sale of the Detroit Edison stock by American are to be
invested primarily in the equity of Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line
Co., a new long-distance line designed to bring gas from the Texas
area to the distributing subsidiaries of American. Under the plan,
American will also purchase all shares of its outstanding preferred
stock tendered to it during a specific period. The offer to purchase
has been fixed at $33 per share plus accrued dividends. As holder
of a substantial block of these shares, Railways will make disposition
of its holdings tlirough this offer.
Railways also proposes to dispose of its interests in Madison Gas &
Detroit Edison (shares received from American) and will also divest
itself of its holdings in American through the payment to its own
stockholders of dividends of stock of this company or by sale through
a rights offering. Proceeds of stock sales made by Railways will then
be applied against its outstanding bank loan. The proceeds of new
serial note borrowing .by Railways will be used to retire the prior
preference stock of Railways and to make an additional cash investment in its subsidiarJ:, Continental Gas & Electric Corp., enabling the
latter comp~ny to retire ~
sImIIl;tramount of Its oWIl;outstanding bank
loans. Review proceedmgs WIth respect to certam aspects of this
approved plan are still pending.

The West Penn Electric Co."

American Water Works & Electric Co., Inc. (American) was dissolved during the past fiscal year. This was in accordance with the
two-plan program filed by the company under section 11 (e) and
approved after some modification by the Commission in its findings
and opinions of December 23,1946, and February 17, 1947.60
Plan I, designed to establish an exempt holding company to acquire
and hold the water properties of American, was brought to completion with the sale of 2,687,069 shares of common stock of the American Water Works Co., Inc. (Water Works), a nonutility holding
company, at competitive bidding on September 25, 1947. The sale
was subject to a 10-day stand-by arrangement permitting the exercise of subscription warrants by common stockholders of American
and acceptance of an exchange arrangement by certain public stockholders of Community Water Service Co. and Ohio Cities Water Corp.,
two intermediate holding companies which were to be dissolved.
Under these purchase and exchange rights 784,593 shares were taken
up ; the balance of the common went to underwriters.
Transfer of the water properties by American to the other holding
company and receipt of proceeds from the stock sale permitted American to go forward thereafter with plan II looking toward its own
liquidation and dissolution. To this end, the outstanding debt and
preferred stock of American were retired, but an escrow fund of
$2,200,000 was established to provide for such additional payments to
the preferred holders, over and above par plus accrued dividends, as
the Commission and the courts may finally determine to be fair and
equitable. The common-stockholders of American received shares of
the reclassified common stock of The West Penn Electric Co. (West
Penn) which has now become the senior company of the utility system
remaining under the jurisdiction of this Commission. American contributed all its remaining assets to West Penn, which also assumed
whatever liabilities were not otherwise provided for. Final dissolution
of American occurred in January 1948. It is noted that when American originally registered under the act it had a total of 142 utility
and nonutility subsidiaries. West Penn which now succeeds it as the
registered parent holding company had 25 subsidiaries on June 30,
1948.
FINANCING UNDER SECTIONS 6 AND 7

The postwar expansion program of the electric and gas industry,
which experts estimate will require an average expenditure of more
than $2,000,000,000a year for the next 5 years, went into full swing
during the 1948 fiscal year. Reports indicate that about $2,200,000,000
was spent during that period WIth indications that expenditures in the
1949 fiscal year will exceed that amount. In 1941 they amounted to
only $700,000,000and in the peak years of the twenties never exceeded
$1,000,000,000. That the scale of expansion of the utility industry is
fully in step with that in other sectors of the economy is indicated by
the fact that capital expenditures for the country as a whole are
running at a dollar rate twice that of the peak years of the 1920's.
Furthermore, this increase in expenditures is not wholly due to price
eoFormerly a subsidiary of American Water Works & Electric Co., Inc .
.. Holding Company Act releases Nos. 7091 and 7208.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

advances but represents an increase in the rate of expansion in physical
facilities as is shown by the fact that private electric utilities plan to
install 17,000,000kilowatts of. capacity. during the 4 years 194~51,
as against 9,000,000kilowatts installed 111 the prevIOus 4-year period
of peak installation, 1925-28.
To finance this huge volume of capital expenditures the gas and
electric industry drew on the capital markets for about $2,000,000,000
of new money, the largest amount ever raised for new construction by
the electric and gas utilities in anyone year. The remainder of the
funds required, about $200,000,000,came from internal sources. To
obtain the funds raised from outside sources they sold approximately
$1,400,000,000of bonds and debentures, placed about $300,000,000of
short-term notes with banks and other financial institutions, and sold
approximately $100,000,000of preferred and $200,000,000of common
stocks. Since more than $600,000,000of securities were sold for refunding and other purposes, total issues for all purposes during the
year totaled over $2,700,000,000.
This trend was reflected fully in the financing operations of the
holding company systems subject to the act as evidenced by the fact
that applications and declarations for security issues approved under
sections 6 (b) and 7 rose from $1,200,000,000in the fiscal year ending
June 30,1947, to $1,900,000,000in the 1948fiscal year. This level was
only $400,000,000below the figure for 1946, which represents the alltime peak for financing under the act. Fifty percent of the dollar
amount of financing approved in 1948 took the form of bonds and
debentures, 24 percent was in short-term notes sold primarily to banks,
and 26 percent in stock, of which 22 percent was represented by common and 4 percent by preferred.
The dollar volume of refundin~ issues was slightly higher,
$573,000,000as against $557,000,000 III 1947. But the percentage to
the total declined from 49 percent to 31 percent. In 1946 refunding
accounted for 85 percent of the total, amounting to over $2,000,000,000.
The factors accounting for the continued decline in the importance
of refunding issues since 1946 are the same as were pointed out in last
year's report, namely, that most companies had already completed
their refundings. Furthermore, money rates have continued to harden
and other costs of refunding have remained on a more expensive
plane. All of the increase in financing during the past year can be
accounted for by issues for new money. The dollar volume of new
money issues rose from $287,000,000in 1947 to almost $1,000,000,000
in 1948. In 1946 new money issues accounted for only $2,000,000of
the total and in the previous peak year, 1942, it totaled only
$90,000,000. Issues for new money accounted for over 50 percent of
the total dollar value of applications and declarations approved in
1948, as against 25 percent in the previous year and less than onetenth of 1 percent in the 1946 fiscal year. Two hundred and twentysix of the 285 issues approved during the year were for this purpose
in whole or in part. The significance of these data is enhanced when
considered in the light of the fact that, during the period in question, a
substantial number of companies have been released from jurisdiction
of the act by divestment under section 11.
Bonds and notes were the principal vehicle employed to raise this
new rooney, accounting for 40 percent and 27 percent, respectively,

FOURTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

77

of the total applications and declarations authorized in 1948. In the
previous year notes and common stock predominated.
Of the 56
bond issues approved, 42 were sold at competitive bidding in an aggregate amount of $338,000,000; 13 issues totaling $47,000,000 were
placed directly with banks and insurance companies; and 1 issue of
$14,000,000 was taken by the parent company. With respect to the 106
note issues authorized 98, amounting to $222,000,000, were placed with
banks and insurance companies and 8 issues totaling $46,000,000 were
taken by parent companies. Of nine debenture issues approved in the
1948 fiscal year eight, with a dollar volume of $118,000,000, were offered
to the public through underwriters, and one, amounting to less than
$500,000, was taken by an insurance company.
The most striking change in the pattern of financing from the
previous year was in the increase in the percentage of notes and common stock and the decline in preferred stock. However, the proportion
of new money financing reflected in authorizations of preferred and
common stocks was relatively low. The 44 common-stock issues representing approximately $117,000,000 of new money financing accounted
for only 12 percent of the total dollar volume of new money offerings.
This relatively minor proportion of common financing is considered due
to the combined effect of several factors. In part, it reflects the less
favorable market conditions prevailing since 1946 and the relatively
high-yield rates necessary to generate public buying interest. The
influence of these two elements is, of course, heightened by the continued existence of a strong market appetite for bonds, debentures,
and notes at very attractive rates of interest. It is recognized, however, that common capital is being increased in many instances by
retention of a portion of earnings, which thus assists in preserving a
balanced capital structure.
Of the common stock financing authorized during the year, over
90 percent represented sales of stock by subsidiaries to their parent
companies. Thus, utility holding companies have purchased over
$100,000,000 of such common stock offerings, to this extent facilitating
the growth of equity capitalization.
Of the total amount, $32,000,000
was taken by American Light & Traction Co., $25,000,000 by American
Gas & Electric Co., $13,000,000 by Electric Power & Light Corp.,
$11,000,000 by the North American Co. ; $8,000,000 by The Middle West
Corp., and the remainder in lesser amounts by other registered holding
companies. In a number of instances funds used to make such stock
purchases have been derived from the sales of the stock of other subsidiaries by the holding company parent pursuant to divestment
programs approved by this Commission under section 11 (e). In
other cases the holding companies have resorted to public financing
. in order to provide the funds required by their subsidiaries,
There has been little marked change in the lack of public appetite for
preferred stocks. This trend has accentuated the reliance upon debt securities and is sufficiently important to merit some discussion at this
point. Yields on preferred stocks were driven to record lows (3.25 percent to 3.35 percent for electric utilities) early in 19-:1:6as a result of
heavy buying by institutions, induced by the pressure of idle funds.
With the postwar development of broad outlets for funds such as mortgages and privately placed industrial construction loans, the institutional market for preferred stocks narrowed. Since yields on preferred

78

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

stocks had for some years been too low to interest individual investors,
the contraction in the institutional demand was immediately felt in
the form of increased yields. A large portion of medium grade stocks
was forced into the individual investor market at yields sometimes in
excess of 5 percent. The sale of preferred stocks, particularly the
medium grade issues, may also have suffered from the less favorable
trend of earnings displayed by many companies in recent months.
Since institutions were no longer under any particular pressure to
buy preferred issues, they were in a position to demand certain concessions in the terms of security. In this way the sinking fund came
into use in connection with utility preferred stocks. These provisions
were initially set up on a 2 percent basis, although some later issues
have carried requirements of 2:lh percent or 3 percent. Thus preferred stock ceases to be permanent capital. A variation of this
arrangement is the purchase fund, which typically operates only when
the security is selling at less than a specified price, usually par or the
offering price. While a sinking fund or purchase fund appeals to
institutional investors, it places an additional cash requirement upon
the issuer and has undoubtedly led some companies to seek other means
of financing.
The declining interest in preferred stock has rendered more difficult
the problem of maintaining an adequate proportion of equity security
in the capital structure.
This is particularly true in view of the
large sums still to be raised for construction purposes. However, we
are continuing our attempts to encourage equity financing as a means
of preserving that strength of the operating companies which has been
achieved through several years' work of overhauling their financial
structures and property accounts."
OTHER

ACTIVITIES

UNDER THE ACT

The remainder of the Commission's work load under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act relates principally to the administration of sections 2, 3, 11 (g), 12 (b), 12 (e), 12 (f), and -13. The cases
arising under these sections are numerous, but few are of an involved
nature. A number, particularly exemptions, received little attention
during the war due to shortages of personnel but with the return of
experienced veterans this backlog has been substantially reduced and
reattainment of a current status is in view.

PART IV
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REOR.
GANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY
ACT

Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1938, in setting
up appropriate machinery for the reorganization of corporations
(other than railroads) in the Federal courts provides for participation
by the Commission in proceedings thereunder at the request of or with
the approval of the court for the purpose of providing independent
expert assistance to the court and to investors and for the preparation
by the Commission of formal advisory reports on plans of reorganization submitted to it by the courts in such proceedings. The Commission's functions in chapter X proceedings are of a purely advisory
character. The Commission has no authority to veto or to require
adoption of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision on any
other issue in the proceedings. It has no right to appeal in such proceedings, although it may participate in appeals taken by others and
has, as a matter of fact, participated in many appeals as a party or as
amicus curiae.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission actively participated during the year in 84 reorganization proceedings involving the reorganization of 105 companies
(84 principal debtor corporations and 21 subsidiary debtors)." The
aggregate stated assets of these 105 companies amounted to $1,744,674,000 and their aggregate indebtedness was $1,130,548,000.2 During the
year the Commission filed its notice of appearance in 10 new proceedings under chapter X, two of which were filed at the request of the
court and the remaining eight upon approval by the court of the
Commission's motion to participate. These 10 new proceedings involved 11 companies (10 principal and 1 subsidiary debtor) with aggregate stated assets of $28,487,000and aggregate stated indebtedness
of $32,620,000. Proceedings involving 13 principal debtors and 4 subsidiary debtors were closed during the year.
At the close of the year, the Commission was actively participating in
71 reorganization proceedings involving 88 companies (71 principal
debtors and 17 subsidiary debtors), with aggregate stated assets of
$1,562,053,000and aggregate stated indebtedness of $1,063,632,000.
COMMISSION'S FUNCTIONS UNDER CHAPTER X

A.detai~ed discussion of the Commission's duties and policies in connection WIth Its functions under chapter X appeared in the Tenth and
Twel~th Annual Reports of the Commission. To carry out its advisory
functions under chapter X, the Commission maintains expert staffs
of lawyers, accountant~, and financial analysts in various regional
officeswhere they ~eep III close touch with all matters arising in the
proceedings and WIth the parties in the case, and are readily available

FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

to the courts.

As a statutory party in interest in a chapter X proceeding, the Commission is concerned not only with proposed plans
of reorganization but also with the many diverse and complex legal
and financial problems that usually arise in the proceeding. Frequently these problems are met through informal conferences and
discussions, in which the Commission's staff participates, in an endeavor to work out solutions in advance of litigation in order to avoid
needless delay and expense. Some of the legal and financial questions
encountered in typical reorganization proceedings are described in the
following paragraphs.
Problems in the Administration of the Estate

The Commission has continued as always to scrutinize the qualifications of trustees in the light of the standards prescribed by the
statute. Since the independent trustee has the duties of examming
into the history and affairs of the debtor, ascertaining its financial
and managerial problems, and formulating the plan of reorganization, it is obvious that the success of the reorganization depends
largely upon his thoroughness and skill and freedom from adverse
or conflicting interests. During the past fiscal year, in an important
case the Commission concluded that certain conduct and affiliations
of the so-called disinterested trustee required that he be removed
from office." In its petition seeking such removal the Commission
alleged, among other matters, that the trustee had permitted a director
and officer of the debtor, who had been connected with the parent
company for many years, to assume a leading role in the preparation
of a report by the trustee as to whether claims existed against the
parent company or whether grounds existed for equitable limitation
or subordination of claims filed by the parent company in the proceeding. The report involved was favorable to the parent company. The
matter is pending before the district court.
The responsibilities of an additional, or operating, trustee, who may
be an officer, director, or employee of the debtor, do not, of course,
assume the proportions of those of the disinterested trustee. Nevertheless, where the additional trustee's interests are adverse to those
of the estate or any class of security holder, his key position together
with the independent trustee in exercising responsibility for operations makes it essential that he be removed from office. In several
cases during the 1948fiscal year, the Commission had occasion to take
steps to have the additional trustee resign or to bring about his removal
because of conflicting or adverse interests or because of the existence
of causes of action against him by the debtor. In all of these cases,
the trustee tendered his resignation after informal conferences.
In connection with the independent trustee's investigation of the
debtor's operations and the reasons for its financial ills, the Commission has frequently found it necessary to advocate the retention bl
the trustee of an independent expert, qualified to appraise the debtor s
property, make valuations, or report upon the efficiencyof the debtor's
operations. In one case, during the fiscal year, the Commission objected to reliance for purposes of valu-ation upon an appraisal of the
debtor's assets made by an officer of the majority stockholder of the
debtor .• In a memorandum filed with the special master, the Com31n re Pittsburgh Railways 00., W. D. Pa.

COMMISSION

mission pointed out the conflicting interests of the appraiser, among
other matters, and urged that a qualified and independent appraiser
be retained. As a result steps have been taken toward the selection
and appointment of such an appraiser.
In another case, involving a large transit system, the Commission
petitioned the court to direct the trustee to employ engineermg experts
to advise whether, and the extent to which, bus routes should be substituted for trolley routes which by far predominated in the system,"
The Commission argued that most large cities had made increasing
use of busses to replace trolleys in the interests of economy and efficiency and that it was important, for purposes of determining the
fairness and feasibility of a plan, to ascertain whether the property
was being operated economically. The Commission also pointed out
that the management showed an apparent predilection for street
railway operations and that an independent, unbiased survey by experts would provide answers to many operating problems. Despite
the special master's adverse recommendation on the ground that,
prima facie, no one would be wronged by adherence to the same business in which security holders invested and which came into control
of the court or by refusal to spend a substantial sum to learn whether
a "different" business would be better, the district court granted
the Commission's petition. The court stated that it was evident from
the facts that a survey should be made whether used in the reorganization or not, and that it might be of value in the proceedings.
One of the fundamental reasons for the mandatory requirement
of the statute that a disinterested trustee be appointed in the larger
cases was to assure a thorough exploration, not solely of the causes
of financial difficulties, but of the possibility of claims against the
old management or other persons and their diligent prosecution. In
view of this precept, the Commission has in varIOUScases urged that
the facts warranted a thorough investigation of possible causes of
action by the trustee against persons controlling the debtor. In two
of these cases the trustee, with the assistance of the Commission,
prepared and made available to security holders a detailed report of
the results of his investigation, including a report on various misrepresentations and omissions in the prospectus under which stock
had been sold to the public," These reports included a reference to the
possible rights that purchasers of the stock might have under section
12 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the time limitations of any
action thereunder contained in section 13 of that act. In another case,
the Commission's motion to require an investigation was denied." In
still another case," the investigation, sought and obtained by the Commission as to the grounds for equitable limitation to cost of certain
bonds acquired by insiders prior to reorganization but during a period
when the debtor was insolvent, resulted in a compromise favorable
to the estate and to the public bondholders.

tice which has generally been condemned by the courts and the Commission in opinions and reports. The accessto inside information and,
frequently, the control or influence over the course of reorganization
which are possessed by these insiders are urgent considerations for
enforcing judicial sanctions against them strictly. One such sanction
which has been used during the fiscal year in several cases in which
the Commission participated is the prohibition against payment of
any fees or reimbursement of any expenses where a fiduciary bought
or sold securities of the debtor. Another sanction is the prevention
of any profiting by such a fiduciary through the limitation of his
securities to the cost thereof or requiring him to account for any
profits from securities sold by him. A compromise entered into in
one case where the purchase of securities occurred prior to the reorganization but when the corporation was insolvent has been mentioned." In another case,'? a committee member had purchased securities of the debtor and of its two subsidiaries, which were also in
reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act. The Commission contended that the committee member as a fiduciary should be limited
to cost or account for the profit on the purchased securities of the
subsidiaries as well as of the debtor under section 212 of the statute
and equitable principles applicable to the situation. A satisfactory
compromise of the issues was entered into and approved by the
court.
In its Thirteenth Annual Report, the Commission referred to the
reorganization proceedings involving National Realty Trust and Federal Facilities Realty Trust and to objections filed to the final accounts
of a former trustee of the debtors based upon charges that he had
permitted certain employees of his to trade freely in securities of the
debtors and their subsidiaries. The special master has since ruled in
favor of practically all of the Commission's contentions and the
matter is pending before the district court for decision.
Activities With Respect to Allowances

The Commission has actively participated in the matter of allowances of compensation to those claiming to have rendered services and
incurred expenses in a proceeding. In granting allowances the courts
seek to protect the estate from exorbitant charges, while at the same
time providing equitable treatment to the applicants. The Commission has continued to provide the courts with considerable assistance
in this matter.
The Commission itself receives no allowances from estates in reorganization and is able to present a wholly disinterested and impartial
view. The Commission has endeavored to obtain a limitation of the
aggregate fees to an amount which the estate can feasibly pay. In
each case, the applications are carefully studied and recommendations
are made to the end that unnecessary duplication of services and
nonbeneficial efforts shall not be recompensed and that applicants
shall be rewarded on the basis of their relative contribution to the
administration of the estate and the adoption of a plan of reorganization. Specific recommendations are made to the courts in cases in
which the Commission has been a party throughout the proceeding

and is fully familiar with the activities of the various parties and all
significant developments in the case.
The Commission has contended consistently that fees be granted
only for disinterested and loyal services rendered to the estate. In
several cases during the past year the Commission opposed the allowance of fees to persons having interests adverse to those of the estate
or the security holders. In one case, applicants were attorneys for a
bondholder who in effect purchased the debtor's property through a
new corporation. The Commission opposed the granting of any fee
out of the estate to these attorneys on the ground that their services
were rendered for the purpose of advancing the individual interests
of their client which were distinct and different from that of other
bondholders in view of his objectives in the reorganization. Hence,
while their services may have contributed to the plan of reorganization, it was contended that they should look to their client for compensation. The district court denied applicants' request for a fee and,
on appeal, the Circuit Court for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the
decision."
In a similar case, the Commission opposed the granting of a fee
to attorneys who represented the lessee of property leased from the
debtor. During the proceedings the lessee had resisted efforts of the
trustee to secure possession of the property despite large arrears of
rent. A compromise was eventually effected which was incorporated
in a plan of reorganization and the applicants requested compensation
out of the estate for their contributions to the plan of reorganization.
The district court upheld the Commission's position that the services
were rendered on behalf of a client whose special interests were adverse to those of the estate and should therefore not be compensated by
the debtor. On appeal, the Circuit Court for the Seventh Circuit
affirmed."
In the proceedings for reorganization involving Pittsburgh Terminal Coal Corp., the Commission took the position that the chapter
X court had jurisdiction to pass upon the reasonableness of all fees
in connection with the reorganization even though such fees were to
be paid by a stockholders' committee and not out of the estate. The
Commission argued that under the specific language of section 221 (4)
the court was required to pass upon all payments made or promised
by any person for services in connection with the proceeding. The
district court did not agree with this position and concluded that
it was without jurisdiction to pass upon the agreement between the
stockholders' committee and its counsel. An appeal to the Circuit
Court for the Third Circuit was taken by the committee but was not
prosecuted and the appeal was dismissed. Subsequently action was
brought III the State court by the attorneys against the preferred
stockholders' committee to enforce the agreement. The Commission
participated, as amicus curiae, in an appeal to the Court of Appeals
of the State of New York from the denial of a motion to dismiss the
?0II?-Pl~i~ton the ground that the chapter X court had exclusive
jurisdiction over the fee agreement. In upholding the contention of
the Commission, the court of appeals held that the chapter X court

INSTITUTION OF CHAPTER X PROCEEDINGS AND JURISDICTION OF
THE COURT

The Commission has striven for a liberal interpretation of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act so that the benefits of chapter X may
be made fully available to security holders in accordance with the
spirit and intent of the statute. In accordance with this policy, the
Commission has participated heretofore in various cases involving
the question of "good faith" in the filing of a petition.
During the past fiscal year the Commission participated in another
case involving the "good faith" of the filing of the petition, the proceeding involving Diversey Hotel Corp. The district court approved
the petition as having been properly filed and in good faith. In
supporting the decision on app~al, the Commission urged that the
debtor could not pay its debts (primarily a large mortgage bond
indebtedness) as they matured and that there was a need for a plan
of reorganization to avoid sacrifice of values through a forced sale.
The Commission pointed out the safeguards and flexibility of chapter
X and urged that a plan of reorganization could involve either a
sale of the property at a fair price and a distribution of the proceeds
or the issuance of new securities in a new or reorganized company
which would acquire the assets of the debtor. The Circuit Court for
the Seventh Circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court.v
Shortly after the enactment of chapter X, the possibility arose of
an improper use of chapter XI which was intended only for the small
corporation with no publicly held securities. Obviously the safeguards to investors of chapter X could be evaded if a corporation
were permitted to effectuate a plan of arrangement affecting public
investors under chapter XI. In the case of Securities and Eechanqe
Oomaniseioa v, United States Realty and Isnprovement 00., the
Supreme Court established the rule that chapter XI was inadequate
to assure to public investors the safeguards necessary for a fair, equitable, and feasible plan and that the Congress intended the reorganization of debtors with publicly held securities to take place under chapter
X. The Supreme Court also held that the Commission could intervene in a chapter XI proceeding for the purpose of having it dismissed as improperly commenced."
During the past fiscal year, the Commission intervened in a chapter
XI proceeding and was successful in having it dismissed." In that
case, the promoter of the debtor corporation, which had leased some
old mining claims of undetermined value, had been unsuccessful in
raising new funds for his project. An attempt to sell stock under
the exemption afforded by regulation A under the Securities Act of
1933 had ended when the Commission began an investigation into
charges of fraud and misrepresentation.
The promoter then conceived the scheme of selling stock to raise money through the device

of a plan of arrangement under chapter XI without compliance with
the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Alleging the need
of funds to pay creditors, the debtor filed a petition under chapter
XI and a plan pursuant to which a new corporation was to be formed
to take over the assets of the debtor. Rights to subscribe to the assessable stock of the new company were offered to old stockholders in
exchange for the nonassessable stock of the debtor. Failure to subscribe meant, of course, that the stockholders would remain with shares
of a defunct corporation.
The Commission moved to dismiss the proceeding, contending that
chapter XI is not available for a corporation seeking to alter the rights
of publicly held securities, that chapter XI is available only for the
adjustment of unsecured obligations and not for the modification of
stockholders' rights, and that the proposed issuance of stock violated
the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The referee dismissed
the proceeding and, at the instance of the Commission, funds collected
from stockholders were returned to them. Subsequently the corporation filed a petition under chapter X.
PLANS OF REORGAN!ZATION UNDER CHAPTER X

The ultimate objective of a reorganization is the formulation and
consummation of a fair and feasible plan of reorganization. Accordingly, the most important function of the Commission under chapter
X is to aid the courts in achieving this objective.
Fairness

In appraising the fairness of reorganization plans under chapter X
the Commission has at all times taken the position that full recognition must be accorded claims in order of their legal and contractual
priority, either in cash or new securities or both, and that junior claimants may participate only to the extent that the debtor's properties
have value after the satisfaction of prior claims or to the extent that
they make a fresh contribution necessary to the reorganization of the
debtor. Hence, a valuation of the debtor is necessary to provide the
basis for judging the fairness as well as the feasibility of proposed
plans of reorganization. In its advisory reports, in hearings before
the courts, and in conferences with parties to proceedings, the Commission has consistently stated that the proper method of valuation for
reorganization purposes is primarily an appropriate capitalization of
reasonably prospective earnings. These principles as to the recognition of priorities and as to valuation are now firmly established as
a result of Supreme Court decisions.
In connection with the fairness of plans, the Commission has been
concerned among other matters with situations where mismanazement or other misconduct on the part of a parent company or cgntrolling person requires that the claim of such person be subordinated
to the claims of the public investors or, where a fiduciary's activities
require, that he be limited to the cost of his claims. Such matters
must be given full co~sideration. since they form an integral part of
the concept of the "fall' and equitable" plan. LIkeWIsethe Commission is concerned with the treatment of causes of action against the
former management or other parties. Unless such claims have been

FOURTEENTiI ~AL

REPORT

89

disposed of by litigation or settlement during the proceeding or as
part of a plan of reorganization, the Commission has argued that the
plan provide for the retention and prosecution of such causes of action
by the trustee. In this way litigation in favor of the estate need not
delay the consummation of the reorganization.
Where operations of the debtor result in the accumulation of cash,
the Commission has generally successfully urged that cash distributions be made to creditors whenever it is feasible to do so, even though
in advance of the J?lan of reorganization. This position was taken
in several cases durmg the past fiscal year. In one case, junior creditors affiliated with the management of the debtor and Its principal
stockholders opposed any distribution to bondholders because certain
issues in the case were still undetermined. Emphasizing the tentative
nature of interim distributions, the Commission argued that the order
for distribution could preserve all the rights of the parties in the case
and that it would be inequitable to withhold partial payment until
final adjudication of all issues where such rights could be preserved."
The district court upheld the Commission's position and directed a
partial distribution to bondholders. An appeal is pending from this
decision to the Circuit Court for the Third Circuit but that court
denied a request for a stay of the judge's order.
Feasibility

Although the representatives of security holders frequently regard
the fairness of the plan as their principal concern, the provisions of
the statute and the protection of investors' interests require also that
the plan be feasible. To be feasible, a reorganization must be economically sound and workable. It must not hamper future operations or lead to another reorganization. The extent to which current
reorganizations are attributable to lack of feasibility in previous
reorganizations is indicated by the fact that numerous chapter X
proceedings involved companies which had already undergone reorganization in equity receivership proceedings or under section 77B
of the Bankruptcy Act. In order to avoid a similar record as to
chapter X cases some years hence, with its attendant expense and
injury to investors, the Commission gives a great deal of attention
to the factors affecting feasibility. In this connection, the Commission is particularly concerned with the adequacy of working capital,
the relationship of funded debt and of the capital structure as a
whole to property values, the adequacy of corporate earning power
in relation to interest and dividend requirements, and the effect of
the new capitalization upon the company's prospective credit.
In recent years the Commission has encountered difficulties because
the parties are disposed to base values and capital structures upon
inflated earnings, either because they overlook the extent to which
earnings are inflated or hope such earnings will continue long enough
to permit debt to be scaled down to manazeable proportions. Another obstacle to the formulation of feasible plans in the current period
of high tax rates is the reluctance of investors to scale down debt and
thereby lose the deduction for interest payments.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Consummation

of Plan

The Commission also gives its attention to the drafting and preparation of corporate charters, bylaws, trust indentures, and other
instruments which are to govern the internal structure of the reorganized debtor. The Commission strives to obtain the inclusion of
various provisions in these instruments which will assure to the investors a maximum of protection, adequate information with regard
to the enterprise, and a fair voice in the management. The Commission has generally opposed the control device of a voting trust except
when its use has been justified by the special circumstances of the case;
and, when adopted, the Commission has sought to have the voting
trust agreement contain appropriate provisions in the interests of the
investors.
Rights to Interest

Creditors' rights to interest on secured claims were the subject of
several decisions rendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit during the past year, in cases in which the Commission
was an active participant.
In In re Realty Associates Securities
00rp.1S a majority of the court held that interest on the principal
amount of a claim continued to accrue after the institution of chapter
X proceedings at the contract rather than the legal or "judgment" rate.
The debtor in this case had covenanted to pay 5 percent interest "until
the reduced principal * * * shall be duly paid," which was held to
be the contractual post-maturity rate. Citing the ruling of the Supreme Court in Vans ton Bondholders Protective Oommittee v, Green,
329 U. S.156 (1946), the court held also that no interest was payable
on that portion of the claim which represented unpaid interest accrued
prior to the date of the chapter X petition. In Empire Trust 00. v,
Equitable Office Building 00rp.,19 a debenture provision for the payment of interest at 5 percent "until such principal shall be paid" was
likewise construed as fixing the post-maturity rate applicable during
the pendency of the reorganization proceeding and as negativing the
6 percent legal rate which might otherwise have been applicable. The
court held also that an express covenant to pay simple interest on overdue and unnegotiated interest coupons is invalid in New York. In
Delatour v. Prudence Realization 00rp.,20 where guaranteed certificates of participation in a 6 percent mortgage issued by the debtor
provided for the remission of only 5lh percent interest to the public
certificate holders by the guarantor servicing-agent, the former were
nevertheless allowed the 6 percent mortgage interest to the exclusion
of the guarantor following default on the guaranty. The court held
that the lh percent interest represented compensation due the guarantor for its guaranty and agency for servicing the mortgage, both of
which terminated upon default.
ADVISORY REPORTS

Although the preparation of an advisory report is not the major
part of the activity of the Commission in any particular case, such
reports, because of their wide distribution, form one of the primary
163 F. 2d 387 (1947), cert. denied, 332 U. S. 836 (1947).

means of contact between the Commission and the public in chapter X
matters. Generally speaking, an advisory report is prepared only
in connection with a proceeding involving significant problems and
a relatively large company in which the investing public has a substantial interest. Even though the Commission in some cases does not
file a formal advisory report, it does, in all cases in which it is a participant, advise the court of its opinion with respect to any plan of
reorganization under consideration by the court.
During the past fiscal year the Commission prepared two supplemental advisory reports with respect to a proposed plan of reorganization involving Childs Co., the owner and operator of a large chain of
restaurants.
Previously the Commission had submitted an advisory
report and two supplemental reports on a plan of reorganization which
failed to receive the required percentage of approval of common stock
holders. The trustee's revised plan was considered to be feasible in
that it provided for adequate working capital and a sound capitalization. It was also considered to be fair in its treatment of creditors and
its allocation of new securities between preferred and common stock
holders, which fell within a range previously stated by the Commission
to be fair. The Commission suggested, however, certain protective
provisions for the preferred-stock holders in respect of pre-emptive
rights, a cumulative sinking fund and a two-thirds approval of any
extraordinary borrowing. Several of these suggestions were adopted
in the revised plan. After court approval, the plan was accepted by
stockholders and confirmed by the court and it has now been consummated.

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 outlaws the exculpatory clauses
used in the past in trust indentures underlying corporate debt securities. Many of these clauses eliminated liability of the trustee for
misconduct to such an extent that the word "trustee" was meaningless
as applied to indenture trustees. The act is designed to insure that
the trustee will act in the interest of the bond or debenture owners
and to insure his complete independence of the issuer and the underwriters. To secure its objectives, the act requires that bonds, notes,
debentures, and similar debt securities publicly offered for sale, sold,
or delivered after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce,
except as specifically exempted by the act, be issued under an indenture
which meets the requirements of the act and has been duly qualified
with the Commission. The provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
and the Trust Indenture Act are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 of securities to be issued under a
trust indenture is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to the requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, and such an indenture is automatically '~qualified" when
registration becomes effective as to the securities themselves. An
application for qualification of an indenture covering securities not
required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which is
filed with the Commission under the Trust Indenture Act, is processed
substantially as though such application were a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.
STATISTICS OF INDENTURES QUALIFIED

While the dollar amount involved in all indentures filed with the
Commission last year for qualification under the act again aggregated more than 2% billions of debt securities, this value shows a
reduction of $138,000,000 from the prior year. At the same time there
was an increase in the number of indentures filed from 108 to 121.
Other significant details concerning indentures examined last year
for qualification and the disposition thereof are shown below.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION

OF

THE INVESTMENT
OF 1940

COMPANY

ACT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires the registration
and provides for the regulation of investment companies, which are,
generally, companies engaged primarily in the business of investing,
reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. Among other
things, the act requires disclosure of the finances and of the investment policies of these companies to afford investors full and complete information with respect to their activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their business or their investment
policies without the approval of the stockholders; bars persons guilty
of security frauds from serving as officersand directors of such companies; prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from
constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies;
requires management contracts III the first instance to be submitted
to security holders for their approval; prohibits transactions between
such companies and their officers and directors and other insiders
except on the approval of the Commission; forbids the issuance of
senior securities of such companies except in specified instances; prohibits pyramiding of such companies and cross ownership of their
securities; and requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their certificates.
UNLAWFUL ACQUISITION BY INVESTMENT COMPANY OF INSURANCE
COMPANY STOCK

A registered, diversified management-investment company of the
open-end type acquired shares representing 50 percent of the voting
stock of an insurance company when it had no interest in the insurance company. The acquisition contravened section 12 (d) (2) of
the act which provides that it shall be unlawful, with exceptions not
pertinent here, for a registered investment company to acquire more
than 10 percent of the outstanding voting stock of an insurance company, unless the investment company owned at least 25 percent of
such securities at the time the purchase is made. Section 47 of the
act declares contracts made in violation of the act void, as regards
the rights of any person who shall have made or engaged in the performance of such contract or of any person, though not a party, who
shall have acquired any right thereunder with knowledge of the
pertinent facts.
After conferring with the staff, the investment company filed an
application under section 6 (c) of the act for an order of the Commission exempting the acquisition from the provisions of section 12
(d) (2). It was stated therein that the vendors had been apprised of
the violation and of their possible rights to rescind but had indicated
a desire to reaffirm the transaction. In its disposition of the case,
the Commission issued an order of exemption conditioned upon
divestment of the insurance company stock by the investment com94

FOURTEE~

REPORT

95

pany and other terms intended to insure that neither the investment
company nor its management would derive any benefit as a consequence of the violation which had occurred. (Investment Company
Act release No. 1189.)
CHANGES IN RULES

A number of changes were made last year further to simplify the
Commission's rules and regulations under this act.
Rule N-17 A-2-Exemption

of Transactions by Banks

During the fiscal year the Commission amended rule N-17A-2
which exempts from section 17 (a) of the act certain purchase, sale,
or borrowing transactions. Prior to the amendment the exemption
was limited to a transaction between a bank and a person engaged
principally in the business of installment financing. The amendment
expanded the exemption provided by the rule so that it would also
apply to certain transactions between banks.
Rule N-17A-4-Exemption

of Contracts With Nonaffiliates

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted rule N-17A-4 to
exempt from section 17 (a) of the act transactions pursuant to a contract where, at the time the contract was made and for a period of
6 months prior thereto, no affiliation or other relationship existed
which would bring the transaction within the purview of section
17 (a). The purpose of this amendment was to provide an automatic
exemption for such transactions since they are effected pursuant to a
contract presumably entered into upon the basis of arm's-length
negotiations.
Rule N-17F-2-Custody

of Securities

Rule N-17F-2 specifies the conditions under which registered management investment companies may lodge their securities and similar
investments in their own custody. During the fiscal year the Commission revised this rule in the interest of clarification. The revision specifically made clear that such investments deposited with a bank or
other company under any arrangements which permit the withdrawal
of such investments by directors, officersor employees upon their mere
receipt are deemed to be in the custody of the registered company and
may be maintained only in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the rule.
Rule N-17G-I-Bonding

of Officers and Employees

During the fiscal year the Commission circulated for public comment
and later adopted rule N-17G-1. This rule implements the provisions
of section 17 (g) of the act regarding the bonding of officers and
employees of registered management investment companies who have
access to securities or funds of the company. The rule permits the
management to determine initially the amount of the bond required,
but reserves to the Commission an opportunity, after appropriate
notice and opportunity for hearing, to fix a minimum reasonable
amount, as well as the type, form and coverage, of such bond.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

STATISTICS RELATING TO REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES

As of June 30, 1948, there were 359 companies registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. During the fiscal year 18 companies registered under the act, and the registration of 11 companies
was terminated. The assets of the 359registered investment companies
aggregated approximately $3,825,000,000,an increase of $225,000,000
over the corresponding figure for 352 companies so registered a year
before. These companies are classified under the act as follows:

During the fiscal year 73 applications were filed under various

to exemption from requirements of the act and the remaining 12 for
a determination of the Commission that the applicant had ceased to
be an investment company within the meaning of the act. At the
beginning of the fiscal year, 50 applications were pending. These
pending applications, together with the 73 filed during the year,
totaled 123 applications which required the appropriate examination
and consideration of the Commission during the year. As a result
of the Commission's action, 79 of these applications were disposed
of during the year and 44 were pending on J nne 30, 1948. The various
sections of the act under which these applications were filed, and the

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTl\ffiNT ADVISERS
ACT OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
investment advisers, persons engaged for compensation in the business
of advising others with respect to securities. The Commission is
empowered to deny registration to or revoke registration of such
advisers if they have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct
in connection with security transactions or have made false statements
in their applications for registration. The act also makes it unlawful
for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud
or deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of their
interest in transactions executed for their clients; prohibits profitsharing arrangements; and, in effect, prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

Approximately 222 of these investment advisers represent in their

investments on the basis of the individual needs of each client. The
services of about 224 others are chiefly through publications of various
types; 237 investment advisers are registered also as brokers and
dealers in securities. Most of the remainder offer various combinations
of investment services.

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION UNDER THE
VARIOUS STATUTES
mE

COMMISSION IN mE COURTS

Civil Proceedings

Complete lists of all cases In which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amW'U8 curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in appendix tables 21 to 33. In addition, appendix table 34
contains a list of all those cases involving the statutes administered
by the Commission (including chapter X cases) which have been decidsd by the courts during the fiscal year, includmg the official citation
of each case and the sections of the statutes involved. The only cases
omitted are those in which no opinion was rendered and which, in
addition, did not involve a novel legal problem.
At the beginning of the 1948 fiscal year 23 injunctive and related
enforcement proceedings instituted by the Commission in connection
with fraudulent and other illegal practices in the sale of securities were
pending before the courts; 25 additional proceedings were instituted
during the year and 27 cases were disposed of, so that 21 of such
proceedings remained pending at the end of the year. In addition,
the Commission participated in a large number of reorganization
cases; in 19 proceedings in the district courts under section 11 (e) of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935; and in 28 miscellaneous actions, usually as amdcue curiae or intervenor, to advise the
court of its views regarding the construction of provisions of statutes
administered by the Commission which were involved in private lawsuits. The Commission also participated in 64 appeals. Of these, 23
came before the courts on petition for review of an administrative
order; 23 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission had taken an active part; 4 were appeals in actions brought by
or against the Commission; 12 were appeals from orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act;
and 2 were miscellaneous appeals.
The civil proceedings in which the Commission participated during
the fiscal year are discussed at length in the sections of this report
devoted to the respective acts involved in the proceedings.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of statutory violations to the Attorney General
who, in his discretion, may institute appropriate criminal proceedings,
As a matter of practice the Commission, largely through its 10 regional
offices,thoroughly investigates suspected violations and, in cases where
the investigation appears to disclose a foundation for criminal proceedings, prepares detailed reports of investigation which are forwarded to the Attorney General. When it is decided to institute
criminal proceedings, the Commission may assign such of its employees
as have participated in the investigation to assist in the preparation

of the case for presentation to the grand jury, in the conduct orthe
trial, and in preparing briefs on appeal. Parole reports on convicted
offenders are prepared also by members of the Commission's staff.
Where the investigation discloses violations of statutes other than
those administered by the Commission, reference is made to the appropriate Federal or State agency.
.
Up to .Iune 30, 1948, indictments had been obtained against 2,517
defendants in 412 criminal cases developed by the Commission.' By
the end of the 1948 fiscal year, 385 of these cases had been disposed
of as to one or more defendants, and convictions had been obtained
in 344, or over 89 percent of such cases, against a total of 1,235defendants," During the 1948 fiscal year 14 indictments were returned
against 33 defendants. Convictions were obtained against 16 defendants in 11 cases during the year. 3
In the criminal appeals decided during the past year judgments of
conviction were affirmed as to three defendants 4 and reversed as to
one defendant, whose case was remanded for a new trial," Upon
retrial this defendant pleaded guilty.
As in prior years. the criminal cases developed by the Commission
and prosecuted during the past fiscal year continued to be extremely
varied in nature. Generally they include fraudulent promotions of
a variety of mining ventures, new businesses, and inventions; fraud
in the sale of securities relating to oil and gas properties; fraudulent
schemes employed by securities brokers and dealers and their representatives; fraudulent practices by corporate "insiders"; and the
unlawful manipulation of stock on a securities exchange.
Cases prosecuted during the year involving the fraudulent promotion of a variety of mining ventures included U. S. Y. lJf oqnu« G.
Thomle et al. (Mass.); U. 8. v, Bennett S. Dennison (S. D. Cal.) ;
U. S. v. F. E. Nemec et al. (E. D. Wash.); U. S. v. Wallace R. O'Keefe
(W. D. 'Wash.); and U. 8. v. James A. Allen et al. (E. D. Wash.).
In the Thomle case two defendants were convicted for a fraudulent
promotion in connection with the sale of stock of a silver-mining company and for selling such stock in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The defendants were charged,
among other things, with employing the "Ponzi" type of swindle,
wherein purported dividends were paid to investors out of the capital
funds of the mining corporation 'which was the subject of the promotion. Another conviction for a fraudulent mining promotion was
obtained in the Dennison case, where the defendant was charged with
selling stock of a gold-mining corporation by means of false representations including, among others, that the company owned valuable mining properties on which rich gold ore deposits had been discovered and that the company had ample capital to put its mining
properties into successful commercial production. Dennison was also

found guilty on another indictment which charged him with the
fraudulent sale of securities relating to the promotion of a new business, a proposed corporation which purportedly was to engage in
the production and sale of building materials.
In the Nemec and O'Keefe cases the defendants were charged with
fraudulently selling securities in connection with the promotion of
various gold mining ventures. The indictments in these cases charged,
inter alia, that the defendants made false representations as to the
ownership of the mining properties which were the subject of the
promotion. It was also charged in the N emec case that the defendants
fraudulently claimed that they had acquired the exclusive rights to a
secret process for the recovery of gold and other metals, which process
purportedly had been invented by one of their associates who was
falsely represented to be a nuclear physicist, eminent chemical engineer, and key atomic scientist in the development of the atomic bomb
at the Hanford project. After the close of the fiscal year convictions
were obtained in both of these cases,"
In the Allen case the defendants are charged with fraudulently selling the stock of two silver mining corporations. The indictment
charges, in addition to other things, that the defendants falsely represented that the proceeds received from the sale of stock would be used
for the exploration and development of the corporations' mining
properties, whereas according to the indictment the defendants appropriated and diverted a large amount of such proceeds to their own use
and benefit,'
Convictions in connection with the fraudulent promotion of new
businesses were obtained during the past year in U. S. v. Thomas A.
Neely (N.D.Ill.) and U.S. v, JolllnH. Boal (N.D.Cal.).
TheNeely
case involved the fraudulent sale of securities of various corporations
which were organized or to be organized for the purported purpose
of providing barge-transportation facilities to a number of prominent
steel and oil companies. In the Boal case the defendant was convicted
for fraudulently selling various securities in connection with the
promotion of a corporation which purportedly was to engage in the
manufacture of artificial gas from hydro-carbon oils.
A promotion relating to the development of various oil and gas
properties was involved in U. S. v. Cactus Oil 00. et al. (Del.), in which
an indictment was returned during the year charging violations of the
registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
in the sale of preorganization subscriptions and stock of the defendant
corporation. The defendants are charged with making various false
representations as to the size and value of the oil and gas properties
owned by the corporation and the quantity of oil and gas being produced from such properties. The indictment further charges the
defendants with employing the "Ponzi" and "reloading" fraud techniques in that they are alleged to have caused purported "dividends"
to be paid by the corporation out of capital for the purpose of inducing
investors to make repeated purchases of stock,"
"In the Nemec case one defendant pleaded guilty at the opening of the trial, four others
were found guilty after trial, and two others were acquitted, one by the jury and one by
direction of the court. In the O'Keefe case, O'Keefe, who was the sole detendant, entered

The indictment in V. S. v. Ohester S. Plasket (W. D. Texas) alleges
that the defendant fraudulently sold royalty interests and other securities in connection with the promotion of two inventions, known as the
"Magic Fountain Shaving Brush" and the "Magicflo Siphon Jigger,"
a plastic liquor dispensing device,"
Several cases involved charges of fraud and unlawful conduct on
the part of securities brokers and dealers and their representatives.
These were V. S. v. Wells E. Turner (W. D. Wisc.) ; U. S. v. Kenneth
Leo Bauer et al. (N. J.) ; U. S. v. Arthur L. Augustine (N. D. Iowa);
and U. S. v, Olarence Everett Martin (N. D. Ill.). Convictions were
obtained in the Turner, Bauer." and Augustine cases, in which the
indictments charged, inter alia, that the defendants converted and
appropriated to their own use and benefit securities and funds belonging to their customers. The indictment in the Martin case charges
the defendant with employing a scheme to defraud representatives of
the estates of deceased and incompetent persons in connection with
the purchase and sale of various securities owned by such estates.
According to the indictment, Martin represented that he would dispose of the securities owned by the estates at the current market prices
and instead concealed the true current market value of such securities
and purchased them for his own account at prices less than the prevailing market prices,"
Fraudulent sales of securities of an alleged fraternal association
resulted in the conviction of the defendant in U. S. v. Preston E.
Douglass (N. D. Ill.). According to the indictment Douglass, by
means of various false representations, induced investors to purchase
stock purportedly issued or to be issued by the Frederick Douglass
Afro-American Cooperative Industry Builders Association, Inc., a
non-profit Illinois corporation (which was by statute prohibited from
issuing stock), which association had been organized by Douglass supposedly for the purpose of improving the economic status and welfare
of the Negro race and to furnish investors with employment in cooperative stores and on farms which the association would develop and
establish.
Fraudulent practices by corporate "insiders" were involved in
U. S. v. Alfred Epstein et al. (E. D. Mich.), in which three defendants were found guilty of mail fraud violations in connection with
the operation of two brewery corporations. The defendants were
alleged to have siphoned off to themselves substantial sums of moneys
from these brewery corporations through the medium of a number
of other companies which they had organized for the purpose of reselling brewing materials to the brewery corporations.>
In U. S. v. Albert B. Windt et al. (N. D. Cal.), the defendants were
convicted of manipulating and conspiring to manipulate the stock of
a mining company listed on the San Francisco Mining Exchange.
According to the indictment, the defendants conspired to and did
raise the market price of such stock on the exchange by a series of
manipulative transactions designed to create the appearance of active
trading and to raise the price of such stock for the purpose of inducing
others to purchase the stock at the higher prices.

In a number of cases Canadian mining company stocks were sold to
residents of the United States by persons residing in Canada who
operated from across the border without compliance with the statutes
of this country. The Commission has been cooperating with the State
Department and the Department of Justice in efforts to secure a treaty
with Canada which would permit the extradition of persons violating
Federal and State securities laws. The treaty was ratified by the
United States Senate in May 1942, but has not yet been ratified by
the Canadian Parliament.
Numerous cases of this type have been
the subject of investigation by the Commission and indictments have
been obtained in a number of these cases. One such case is U. S. v.
Albert E. Broadley et al. (W. D. N. Y.), in which an indictment was
returned during the 1948 fiscal year charging the defendants with
employing a scheme to defraud in the sale of stock of two Canadian
corporations in connection with the promotion of gold and nickel
mining ventures. In part, the indictment charges that the defendants rendered a purported free investment advisory service, the sole
purpose of which was to sell the stock of these corporations, and that
they falsely represented that the moneys received from the sale of
such stock would be used for the development of the corporations'
mining properties,"
Constant vigilance is maintained by the Commission in order to
cause the apprehension of the defendants in these Canadian cases if
they should enter the United States. During the past year such
efforts were successful in causing the apprehension of the defendants
in two such cases, U. S. v. Albert Edward DePalma (N. D. Ohio)
and U. S. v. Noel H. Knowles et al. (E. D. N. Y.). The indictments
in these cases, which had been impounded by the Federal district
courts at the time of their return, were made public after the defendants had been apprehended. DePalma, who Was released on
$50,000 bail, failed to appear for arraignment and forfeited his bail.
He is presently a fugitive in Canada. The defendants in the other
case are awaiting trial.
The criminal appeals decided during the 1948 fiscal year were:
Kaufmanv. U. S., 163 F. (2d) 404 (C. A. 6, 1947), certiorari denied,
333 U. S. 857 (1948), in which a conviction for the fraudulent sale of
stock of Devon Gold Mines, Ltd., a Canadian corporation, was affirmed; U. S. v, Freeman, 167 F. (2d) 786 (C. A. 7, 1948), wherein
the court sustained the conviction of the appellant for conspiracy and
using the mails to defraud in connection with transactions involving
the exchange of whisky warehouse receipts for bottling contracts;
Reining v. U. S., 167 F. (2d) 362 (C. A. 5, 1948), in which the court
affirmed the defendant's conviction on four counts 14 charging violation of the Mail Fraud Statute in the fraudulent sale of various oil
and gas leases; U. S. v. Grayson, 166 F. (2d) 863 (C. A. 2, 1948),
wherein the court reversed the conviction of Grayson for conspiracy
and fraud violations in connection with the sale of various oil and gas
interests. In the latter case, the court found that the evidence supported the jury's verdict but remanded the case for a new trial because of certain errors committed during the trial. Upon retrial

COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

During the 1948 fiscal year the Commission received 5,921 items of
mail concerned with alleged securities violations. These communications are classified administratively as "complaint enforcement" correspondence. While they relate to complaints and alleged violations
of various laws administered by the Commission, the bulk of them
deals with the enforcement of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This material constitutes an important source of information concerning possible securities violations. Investigations made by the
Commission's staff and contacts maintained with other governmental
or private agencies provide additional sources of such information.
Where it appears on the basis of any such data that any securities
violation may have occurred, the Commission conducts appropriate
investigations by means of correspondence or the assignment of cases
to field investigators to ascertain the facts of the particular case.
The extent of the investigatory activities of the Commission during
the past year under the Securities Act of 1933,the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; sections 12 (e) and (h) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935; the Investment Company Act of 1940; and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940is reflected in the following table:

Securities Violations File

To assist in the enforcement of the various statutes which it administers, and to provide a further means of preventing fraud in
the purchase and sale of securities, the Commission has established a
securities violations file. This file constitutes a clearing house of
i~formatio~ concerning persons who ha:e. been charged with violations of varIOUSFederal and States securities statutes. It is kept up
to date by the Commission in cooperation with the United States
Post OfficeDepartment, the Federai Bureau of Investigation, parole
and probation officials, State securities commissions, Federal and
State prosecuting attorneys, police officials,members of the National
Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., and members of the
United States Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the 1948 fiscal
year this fil.econtain~d .data concerning 49,1.00persons against whom
Federal or, 111 the majority of cases, State action had been taken in connection with securities violations. During the past year alone addi-

tional items of information relating to 2,771 persons were added to
these files, including information concerning 1,170persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearinghouse of information by the
Commission and the cooperating agencies. During the past year, in
connection with the maintenance of the files, the Commission received
2,619 "securities violations" letters or reports (apart from those mentioned above which are classified as "complaint enforcement") and
dispatched 2,424 communications in turn to cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION
AND AUDITING

IN ACCOUNTING

The importance of adequate financial statements and their certification by independent public accountants in ensuring information
necessary for the protection of investors is recognized III the detailed
provisions of the several acts administered by the Commission. These
acts grant the Commission broad authority to prescribe uniform systems of accounts for registrants suoject to the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935,to provide for a reasonable degree of uniformity
in accounting policies and principles to be followed by registered investment companies in maintaining their accounting records and in
preparing financial statements required by the Investment Company
Act of 1940, and to prescribe the form and content of financial statements required to be filed by registrants subject to the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Acting under
this authority the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of
accounts for certain public utility holding companies and for public
utility mutual and subsidiary service companies. The principal accounting requirements prescribed under the acts of 1933, 1934, and
1940 are set forth in regulation S-X, which governs the form and
content of most financial statements filed under these acts. In addition, under the Securities Exchange Act, rules have been adopted
governing record keeping, financial reporting, and the auditing of
the books of exchange members, brokers, and dealers.
Recognizing the pervasive nature of accounting in many of the
Commission's activities under all of the acts and in all of its major
operating divisions, the Commission organized its accounting staff
to facilitate the handling of day-to-day accounting problems and to
ensure reasonable uniformity of treatment of such problems. To this
end the chief accountant acts as the Commission's chief adviser and
consulting officeron accountmg matters and exercises general supervision over the establishment and execution of Commission policy
with respect to accounting and auditing- lrinciples and practices.
Assisting him directly is an assistant chie accountant and a small
staff whose principal functions are to prepare studies of current
problems and to draft necessary rules and opinions. In addition,
there are three other assistant chief accountants, each of whom is
assigned to and is directly responsible for the examination of financial
data and other accounting work in one of the three operating divisions of the Commission, namely, the Divisions of Corporation
Finance, Public Utilities, and Trading and Exchanges.
Although the Commission's accounting requirements, as they exist
in rules, regulations, and forms in use today, reflect nearly 15 years'

106

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

experience involving both formal and informal decisions rendered in
the daily work of the divisions, and although they exhibit the influence of valuable counsel of independent accountants and accounting and financial officers of registrants, as well as the advice of committees of professional and business organizations, other Government
agencies, and numerous public-spirited individuals, these requirements
do not constitute a completely integrated body of accounting principles. It was recognized, however, early in the handling of the Commission's accounting work that decisions would necessarily be made
which would be of general application. To make these decisions
readily available, a program of publication of accounting series releases was inaugurated in 1937. In release No.4 of this series the
Commission, recognizing that differences of opinion with respect to
accounting principles existed in the professional circles, announced
its administrative policy that, in the absence of substantial authoritative support for accounting principles employed, financial statements
were to be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate despite disclosures contained in the certificate of the accountant or in footnotes
to the statements, provided that the matters involved were material.
In the event of a difference of opinion between the Commission and
the registrant as to the proper principles of accounting to be followed,
disclosure would be accepted in lieu of correction of the financial statements only if there was substantial authoritative support for the
practices followed by the registrant and the position of the Commission had not previously been expressed in rules, regulations, or
other officialreleases of the Commission, including the published opinions of its chief accountant. The complete texts of a preseries release and the first 63 releases in the accounting series were republished in one handy volume at the close of the present fiscal year. It
is contemplated that subsequent releases as they are promulgated
will be printed in the same convenient form.
Examination of Financial Statements

The material referred to above comprises the necessary guides to persons contemplating filing financial statements with the Commission.
In addition, all members of the Commission's accounting staff are
available to advise prospective registrants and their accountants in
conference or by correspondence, prior to filing. Experienced practitioners who recognize unique problems regularly follow this procedure and save valuable time for themselves and their clients. The
public accountant without experience with the Commission should not
hesitate to do likewise. Although many problems are encountered
and solved in this way, a substantial part of the Commission's accounting work lies in the examination of financial statements after filing.
In the event that the examination discloses lack of compliance with
the rules o~ regulations or a failure to app~y generally accepted accounting principles the customary procedure ISto advise the registrant
by letter. The problems raised may then be resolved eit~er by correspondence or conference, WhIChmay result In corrections in the
financial statements. It is only in the rarest cases that formal procedures are necessary to effect a solution. It is appropriate to observe
again this year that ~umerous inquiries on accounting subjects were
received from companies and accountants not involved in proceedings
before the Commission. A growing practice not mentioned hereto-

fore in these reports is the request from teachers and students of
accounting for assistance in research projects or for copies of accounting series releases and regulations for use in university classes--some
devoted especially to the study of Commission procedures.
Proposed Amendment of Regulation S.X

During the 1948 fiscal year the Commission requested public comment on several proposals to amend regulation S-X. These proposals
are discussed below.
Article 6B for face-amount certificate companies.-In
connection
with the development of rules relating to face-amount certificate companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Commission
on August 5, 1947, announced that there was under consideration a
proposal for the adoption of a new article 6B in regulation S.X to
prescribe the form and content of financial statements to be filed with
the Commission by face-amount certificate companies." The article
as proposed gives appropriate recognition to the special provisions
of section 28 of the act relating to certificate reserves and "qualified
investments." The proposal has been discussed with officials of the
principal companies concerned and their independent accountants in
a series of conferences.
Article 5..1 for commercial, industrial, and mining companies in the
promotional, eeploratorp or development stage.-8ince
the adoption
in 1936 of Form A-O-1 for securities of corporations organized within
2 years to engage in the exploitation of mineral deposits other than
oil or gas, the Commission has prescribed one or more forms containing provisions for special presentation of financial statements to
be used instead of the conventional balance sheets and profit and loss
statements. Form A-O-1 since has been superseded. The currently
effective Forms S-2, S-3, and 8-11 provide for separate statements
of assets and capitalized expenses, liabilities, capital shares, other
securities, and cash receipts and disbursements. Except for immaterial differences in captions the general form and content of these
financial statements !!-rethe same for the three forms. The purpose
of the present proposal 16 is to include these alternative forms of
financial statements in regulation S-X and to extend their use to
applications for registration on Form 10 and to annual reports on
Forms 10-K and 1-MD for companies of the type described. Prior
to publishing the proposal for general comment the staff had the
valuable assistance of the American Institute of Accountants' A.ccounting Procedure Committee Subcommittee on Mine Accounting in a
series of conferences to explore the desirability of the proposal and
thereafter to comment on a series of preliminary drafts.

Amendment of Form 8-3

Of interest to accountants serving small mining companies is the
amendment of Form 8-.1 announced in Securities Act release No.
3269 (1947). Prior to the amendment the form required certified
financial statements as of a date within 90 days prior to the date of
filing. The amendment provides that these statements need not be
certified if there are also filed corresponding certified statements as
of a date within 1 year prior to the date of filing.
Simplified Records for Brokers and Dealers

In an effort to assist brokers and dealers operating on a limited scale
and with a minimum of officestaff, the National Association of Securities Dealers during the past year prepared a simple set of bookkeeping
forms and illustrations depicting the proper recording of transactions
of a small over-the-counter busmess. Members of the Commission's
staff were consulted during the preparation of the material and the
finished project was submitted for comment. It was the opinion of the
staff that if the use of the forms was confined to those members of the
NASD whose business ordinarily involved the kinds of transactions
comprehended by the forms submitted, the records thus maintained
should comply with the requirements of rule X-17A-3, assuming, of
course, that in individual cases the firm reflected the information contemplated by the rule. It was observed that the forms submitted did
not provide for certain complex types of transactions for which records would have to be maintained pursuant to the rule and for which
the individual broker-dealer engaging in such transactions would have
to provide the necessary records.
Commission Cases of Particular Interest to Accountants

Tobey Royalties Oo., InoP-The broker-dealer in this case was one
of a class required by section 17 (a) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934and rule X-17 A-5 thereunder to file annual reports of financial
condition. After appropriate hearing the Commission revoked the
company's registration for its failure to file such reports for 1943,1944,
and 1946, for filing a false and misleading report for 1945, and for
refusing to permit representatives of the Commission to examine its
books. Prior to taking this action the Commission had made repeated suggestions to the company regarding the proper manner of
compliance with the requirements of the act and the rule.
Globe Aircraft Corp.IS-In its accounting aspects this case is particularly interesting because of the significance of conditions arising
after the date of the certified financial statements included in the
registration statement but before the effective date of the registration
statement. These undisclosed adverse financial developments led to
the bankruptcy of the corporation and the Commission suspended
the effectiveness of the registration statement. As originally filed
the registration statement included an audited profit-and-loss statement for the last 4 months of 1945 which showed a loss of $540,000
as compared with net income of $53,000 for the full year. Of the

$540,000 loss $439,000represented a write-down of inventories from
cost to replacement value. At the request of the Commission a profit
and loss statement for the following January was included in an
amended prospectus. 'While disclosing a loss of $17,000for the month
this unaudited statement made no reference to additional inventory
write-downs necessitated by the continuation of excess costs for workin-process inventory incurred throughout January and February
1M6. Despite an assertion that there was a probability that a tax
refund would offset a substantial part of the indicated inventory
losses, the Commission held that the failure to disclose the situation
made the January profit-and-loss statement materially false and misleading. The registration statement was also found materially false
and misleading in that (1) it failed to disclose material increases
in outstanding note liabilities between the date subsequent to the
balance sheet as of which such liabilities were shown and the effective
date of the registration statement, and (2) misstated the issuer's
working capital needs by statin~ that the issuer intended to use the
proceeds from the sale of the securities being registered for the payment of an outstanding loan and the purchase of a plant, when in fact
the company's financial condition was such that it could not have
intended so to apply the proceeds since such proceeds were required
for working capital.
T'homascolor, Inc.lo-This case is fully discussed at page 13 of this
report. It will be recalled that the registration statement showed
"Patents and patent applications" amounting to $2,000,000 in total
assets of $2,500,000. Although the intangible item was supported
by a footnote disclosing the number of shares of capital stock of the
registrant issued for assets acquired from predecessor interests and
presenting a comparison of the resulting valuations with amounts
carried on predecessor balance sheets, the presentation was considered misleading in two basic respects. The amounts shown as patents and patent applications included some $700,000 representing
promotion stock to be acquired by the registrant for a nominal
amount, and a substantial amount which was actually promotion expense. The amended balance sheet clarified the presentation, segregated the promotional items and more adequately disclosed the effect
of the agreement by which the registrant would receive the promotional stock. This case is the latest in a long series of cases involving
promotional enterprises in which the Commission has held that values
assigned to intangible assets acquired in exchange for stock must be
scrutinized with care to avoid a misleading result in the financial
statements due to the presence of inflated or improperly classified
asset accounts.
Drayer-Hanson, Inc.2°-In a report on an investigation it was determined that a registration statement which had become effective
contained untrue statements of material facts and omitted to state
material facts necessary to make the facts disclosed in the statement
not misleading. The registration statement when it became effective
on December 11, 1946, contained a certified balance sheet for the
predecessor partnership as of April 30, 1946, and a certified profitand-loss statement for the 10 months then ended. In June 1947 the

company and its independent public accountants informed the Commission that the controller of the company had discovered an overstatement in the inventory of work-in-process and fabricated parts of
approximately $97,000 which resulted in a similar overstatement of
partnership net worth and net income reflected in the statements referred to above. Reexamination by the auditors indicated the overstatement to be approximately $85,000in an inventory item of $244,000
and in the net income of $181,000shown in the erroneous statements.
The company had not taken a physical inventory of work in process
since December 31, 1944; hence the auditors had not been able to
employ the generally accepted auditing procedure of observing the inventory taking, but stated in their certificate that they had made tests
of selected items subsequently to assure themselves of the existence of
the inventory and of the adequacy of the related accounting data.
However, the alternative procedures employed by the auditors did
not disclose the failure of the registrant to give effect to all partial
shipments from work in process. The Commission concluded that
under the circumstances of this case there was no justification for the
omission of the inventory taking. It was concluded further that
in view of the manner in which the audit work was done the accountants were not justified in stating in their certificate that they
had no reason to believe that the inventories as set forth in the statements were not fairly stated.
Developments in Accounting Principles and Procedures

During the year the high level of prices and of business activity
stimulated an unusual amount of discussion in financial and professional circles of certain basic problems in corporate accounting
and financial reporting. These problems have been reflected in many
of the registration statements and annual reports filed with the
Commission.
One of the problems discussed during the year was the accounting
treatment of general purpose contingency reserves and reserves designated for special purposes. One aspect of the subject, that of the
disposition of war reserves, was mentioned last year. It appears
that with few exceptions these reserves were eliminated during the
year by charges of the type anticipated when the reserves were created
and by the return of unabsorbed balances to earned surplus.
Another facet of the reserve question mentioned in the Thirteenth
Annual Report was the propriety of creating, from income, reserves
for future inventory price declines. Publication early in the 1948
fiscal year by the American Institute of Accountants of a research
bulletin on the subject of "Inventory Pricing," followed a few months
later by a bulletin on "Inventory Reserves," is a contribution to the
solution of the problem substantially in accord with the views set
forth in our last report. The Institute's bulletin on the "Accounting
Treatment of General Purpose Contingency Reserves" furnished support for the position that the creation and subsequent elimination of
such reserves have no part in the determination of income.
In the examination of financial statements it has been necessary in
some cases to take exception to profit-and-loss statements reflecting
an optional presentation permitted by both of the reserve bulletins
referred to in the preceding paragraph. Both of the bulletins express a preference for creating the reserves in question by a segrega-

tion or appropriation of surplus but permit their creation by appropriation of net income disclosed on the profit-and-loss statement,
provided net income is first determined and clearly designated. Experience has shown that this last admonition has not been adequately
observed in all cases. Even when applied meticulously in the financial
statements, officers of the corporations and financial writers in referring to "net income for the year" frequently emphasize the final
figure after deduction of the reserve appropriation rather than the
designated net income. It is for this reason that our chief accountant
has taken the position that appropriations of the type in question
should be reflected only in the surplus statement and should not be
shown on the profit-and-loss statement. The Commission is advised
that the American Institute of Accountants' committee on accounting
procedure, having recognized the unsatisfactory results from the
optional treatment, has adopted a bulletin prescribing alternate methods of presenting information as to the disposition of income which
would prohibit the form of dubious reporting discussed above.
One old problem in accounting cropped up with renewed vigor
early in the fiscal year. This is the theory that depreciation of fixed
assets is related directly to replacement and that reserves for depreciation are inadequate if they are not equal to replacement cost
of the property at the time of its retirement from service. One of
the country's largest corporations applied this theory in its reports to
stockholders in 1947 by including an extra charge for depreciation
in its profit-and-loss statements on the grounds that replacement cost
of the assets would be greater than recorded cost and that the procedure adopted was consistent with their accounting for inventories
on the last-in-first-out basis. The company's independent accountants
expressed an exception in their certificate by stating that the procedure followed by the corporation was not ill accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This example is cited because
it is perhaps the most clearly presented and most vigorously defended
of a number of efforts that have come to the Commission's attention
to deal with the effects of the present high price levels. The problem
is being given serious consideration and will be the subject of continuing study to determine whether there is justification for the
substitution of new procedures for the presently accepted basis of
recording fixed assets at cost and allocating appropriate portions of
that cost to expense during the anticipated useful life of the assets.
A problem which has been under consideration and which has been
the subject of repeated exchanges of views between the Commission's
staff and representatives of the American Institute of Accountants and
other interested parties is the concept of income and the proper form
of income or profit-and-loss statement most informative to investors,
At the close of the last year the discussion had progressed to a point
where it was the general opinion that a representative body of accountants or this Commission should publish conclusions on the subject
in the near future. The result was the publication in December 1947
by the committee on accounting procedure of the American Institute
of Accountants of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 32, on "Income
and Earned Surplus." The bulletin presents the opposing views of
the advocates of the "all-inclusive" and "current operating performance" types of income statements, reiterates the committee's opinion

112

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

that "it is plainly desirable that over the years all profits and losses of
a business be reflected in the net income," and emphatically expresses
the opinion that "there should be a general presumption that all items
of profit and loss recognized during the period are to be used in determining the figure reported as net income." It then proceeds to enumerate certain extraordinary items which should be excluded from
such determination of income "when their inclusion would impair the
significance of net income so that misleading inferences might be
drawn therefrom." Believing that the purposes desired to be served
by this exception to the general presumption of the bulletin can best be
served by proper presentation in an "all-inclusive" type of income
statement, the Commission authorized the staff to take exception to
financial statements which appear to be misleading, even though they
reflect the application of the bulletin. It also authorized the chief
accountant to address a letter to the Institute's director of research
expressing the view that the procedures recommended in the bulletin
seemed to be susceptible to abuse and might result in misleading
income and earned surplus statements in conflict with published rules
and opinions of the Commission. Through the courtesy of the director of research of the Institute and the editor the letter was given
wide publicity in accounting circles by publication in the Journal of
Accountancy immediately following the pages whereon the bulletin
was reproduced." Experience since publication seems to indicate
little attempt to apply the exceptions to which the Commission objected. In this connection it may be noted that the American Accounting Association has just published a revision of its 1941 statement of
"Accounting Principles Underlying Corporate Financial Statements"
in which its endorsement of the all-inclusive form of income statement and the principle of matching costs against revenues as the basis
for the determination of income is reasserted (Accounting Concepts
and Standards Underlying Corporate Financial Statements-1948
Revision).
Developments in Auditing Procedures and Professional Practice

The annual reports of the last 3 years have referred to the financial
questionnaires of broker-dealers prescribed by rule X-17A-5 and
Form X-17A-5 and to the minimum audit requirements specified in
the form as applicable to those broker-dealers whose reports must 00
certified under the rule. As in these past years many of these reports
are filed by small companies employing public accountants who have
had no other experience with Commission requirements. In recognition of this situation the Commission staff, through correspondence
and direct contact by regional officerepresentatives, has devoted considerable time to explaining the requirements as to the content of
the questionnaires to registrants and their accountants where it was
apparent that inexperience rather than deliberate evasion was the
cause of the unsatisfactory reports filed. It is believed that in these
cases a policy of education is more in the public interest than the
imposition of sanctions would be.
It will be recalled that two of the accounting cases described herein
involved inventories of work-in-process as the principal element. In
both cases an overstatement of the work-in-process inventories reII

suIted in corresponding overstatements of the capital stock equity
and of the profit for the period. In this connection it is appropriate
to recall that early in the war period the Commission established, regarding companies engaged in war work, a liberalized policy with
respect to its requirements as to physical inventory verification by
independent public accountants in order to avoid any possible interruption in the production or delivery of war materials." Following
the disclosures in the McKesson &: Robbins, Inc. case, the American
Institute of Accountants adopted certain extensions of auditing procedure, including the requirement that if "inventories arc a material
factor, it should be generally accepted auditing procedure that, in
addition to making auditing tests and checks of the inventory accounts
and records
* * [the independent certified public accountant]
shall, wherever practicaole and reasonable, be present, either in person or by his representatives, at the inventory taking and by suitable
observation and inquiry satisfy himself as to the eflectiveness of the
methods of inventory taking and as to the measure of reliance which
may be placed upon the client's representations as to inventories and
upon the records thereof. In this connection the independent certified public accountant may require physical tests of inventories to
be made under his observation." ~3 III announcing its waiver of this
requirement and the acceptance of substitute procedures during the
war the Commission said:
>,'

It is implicit that, at the earliest opportunity, every reasonable effort will be
made to take physical inventory with normal observation and test checking by
the certifying accountants, and that any practicable improvements III the accounting records and controls of inventory will be undertaken.
Finally, it should be
understuod that waiver of objections with respect to the current annual report
will not necessarily constitute a basis for similar action in respect of annual
reports for subsequent years or statements filed in reglstratrons for the sale
of securlties."

Current representations with respect to the auditing of inventory
accounts are being scrutinized with care in the light of this admonition
and the experience reflected in the cases cited.
Previous annual reports have commented upon the Commission's
practice of cooperation with various accounting groups in the development of accounting and auditing standards of practice. This cooperation has taken the form of interchange of ideas and the institution
of a practice of submitting for comment proposed changes in Commission rules to the several accounting organizations and others interested long prior to the adoption of the Administrative Procedure
Act. In return, the organizations have referred their proposed public announcements in the field of accounting and auditing to the Commission's accounting staff for comment. In addition to the pronouncements referred to above in the field of accounting principles and procedures, a special report by the committee on auditing procedure of
the American Institute of Accountants should be mentioned. The
report published under the title "Tentative Statement of Auditing
Standards-Their
Generally Accepted Significance and Scope" is a
substantial contribution to a general understanding of the responsibilities of independent public accountants. The statement sets forth
standards of field work and reporting ; it recognizes that examinations

of financial statements must be performed with due professional care
by persons having adequate technical training and proficiency and an
independence in mental attitude.
DIVISION OF OPINION WRITING

The Division of Opinion Writing aids the Commission in the
preparation of findings, opinions, and orders promulgated by the Commission in contested and other cases and controversies arising under
the Securities Act of 1933,the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Holding Company Act of 1935,the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,the
Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940. These statutes provide for a wide variety of administrative
proceedings which require quasi-judicial determination by the Commission. Formal opinions are issued in all cases where the nature of
the matter to be decided, whether substantive or procedural, is of
sufficientimportance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Division of Opinion Writing is an independent staff office
which is directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all assignments and instructions from and makes recommendations and
submits its work to the Commission directly. It is headed by a director, who is assisted by an assistant director, supervising attorneys and
a staff of drafting attorneys and a financial analyst.
While engaged in the preparation of opinions assigned to the Division of Opinion Writing, the members of this Division are completely
isolated from members of the operating division actively participating
in the proceedings and it is an invariable rule that those assigned to
prepare such an opinion must not have had any prior participation in
any phase of the proceedings with respect to which the opinion is to
be prepared.
The director or assistant director of the Division of Opinion Writing, together with the members of the staff of the Division who are
assigned to work on a particular case, attend the oral argument of
the cases before the Commission and frequently keep abreast of
current hearings. Prior to the oral argument, the Division makes a
preliminary review of the record and prepares and submits to the
Commission a summary of the facts and issues raised in the hearings
before the hearing officer, as well as in any proposed findings and
supporting briefs, the hearing officer's recommended decision, and
exceptions thereto taken by the parties. Following oral argument or,
if no oral ar~ument has been held, then at such time as the case is
ready for decision, the Division of Opinion Writing is instructed by
the Commission respecting the nature and content of the opinion and
order to be prepared.
In preparing the draft of the Commission's formal opinion, the
entire record in the proceedings is read by a member of the staff of
the Division of Opinion Writing and in some cases he also prepares a
narrative abstract of the record. Upon completion of a draft opinion and abstract of the record, and after their review and revision
within the Division of Opinion Writing, they are submitted to the
Commission. If the study of the record in the case by the Division
of Opinion Writing has revealed evidence of violations warranting a
reference to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution, or has

FOURTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

115

disclosed the desirability or the need for any changes in administrative
procedures or techniques, appropriate recommendations are made to
the Commission at the time the draft opinion in the case is submitted.
The draft opinion as submitted may be modified, amended, or completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's final instructions. When the opinion accurately expresses the views and conclusions of the Commission, it is adopted and promulgated as the official
decision of the Commission. In some cases concurring or dissenting
opinions are issued by individual Commissioners who wish to express
their separate views on matters covered by the opinion adopted! by
the majority of the Commission. In such cases the Division of Opinion Writing is occasionally instructed to prepare drafts of such concurring or dissenting opinions and confers respecting them with the
individual Commissioners involved, submits drafts directly to them,
and makes such modifications and revisions as are directed.
The findings of fact, opinions, and orders adopted and promulgated
by the Commission serve as an aid and guide to the bench and bar.
With minor exceptions (e. g., certain opinions dealing with requests
for confidential treatment) all are publicly released and distributed
to representatives of the press and persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the findings and opinions are printed and published by the Government Printing Officein bound volumes under the
title "Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
The foregoing represents the primary function of the Division of
Opinion Writing-to aid in the preparation of findings, opinions, and
orders promulgated by the Commission in contested cases arising
under the statutes it administers. This function has been assigned to
an independent division so that those who assist in the preparation
of the Commission's decision in a contested case are in no way connected with or participants in the preparation and presentation of the
case at the hearings.
Inaddition to this primary function, the Division is also given many
assignments of a general nature which are not inconsistent with the
objective of the separation of the investigatory and quasi-judicial
functions. Thus, the Division has been assigned continuing joint
responsibility with the office of the general counsel in dealing with
problems arising under the Administrative Procedure Act. It has
also been given the responsibility of preparing a compilation of annotations of the various statutes administered by the Commission, and
from time to time it is given other special assignments by the
Commission.
The Division of Opinion Writing also assists the oJ?erating divisions
of the Commission in the preparation of opinions III certain uncontested cases where participation by the operating division in the decisional process is proper under the Administrative Procedure Act.
In some instances members of the Division of Opinion Writing are
also assigned to assist the office of the general counsel in connection
with court appeals taken from Commission decisions initially drafted
in the Division.
Some of the more significant opinions issued by the Commission
during the year are commented upon in this report under the discussions of the various statutes.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
INTERNATIONAL

FINANCIAL

AND ECONOMIC MATfERS

Foreign issuers, private and governmental, who seek to make public
offerings of their securities in the United States are required to register those securities under the Securities Act of 1933. Often such issues
involve preliminary discussions with representatives of the issuer as
well as other United States agencies prior to registration.
Among the significant issues registered during the year was one
covering bonds of a par value of $131,971,700to be issued by the Italian
Government in exchange for the outstanding dollar bonds of the
Kingdom of Italy. This issue was registered after a series of conferences between the staff of the Commission and representatives of the
Italian Government. The Italian Government filed also an application for registration of the new bonds under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and for listing of the bonds on the New York Stock
Exchange.
On the effective date of the registration the Commission, after COIlsultation with the Departments of State and Treasury, withdrew the
request it had made at the outbreak of the war that brokers and dealers
in this country refrain from making a market in Italian securities.
The Italian issue was the only foreign governmental issue registered
during the year. Foreign private registrations of securities during
the year amounted to $18,040,890.25
The Commission maintains, through its Adviser on Foreign Investment, facilities for liaison with other agencies which might have jurisdiction over or interest in problems of foreign finance. The Commission has continued its representation on the Staff Committee of
the International Advisory Council on International Monetary and
Financial Problems. It has continued to cooperate with other agencies
concerned with the development of the Government's foreign economic
program through the Executive Committee on Foreign Economic Policy and its subcommittees on Foreign Investment Policy, Private Monopolies and Cartels, and the United Nations Economic Subcommittee. The Commission is represented also on the Federal Committee
on International Statistics formed to advise and assist the United
States member of the United Nations Statistical Commission.
Among the projects involving the foreign economic field in which
the Commission participated during the year the following may be
listed. In furtherance of the European recovery program the Commission submitted a report and analysis of the volume, kind, and
liquidity of United States assets held by countries participating in
the European relief program and by their citizens including a review
of the steps which those countries have taken to utilize these assets.
In this connection, the Commission participated in the preparation
of the European recovery program through membership on the Financial Policy Committee of the Steering Committee of the European recovery program, which formulated the policy and prepared the documents for presentation to the Congress of all financial problems involved in the program. The Commission contributed to and participated in a report on "Foreign Assets and Liabilities of the United

States and Its Balance of International Payments" submitted to the
Committee on Finance of the United States Senate at the request
of that committee. This report was transmitted by Secretary of the
Treasury Snyder as Chairman of the National Advisory Council as
the work of a committee composed of representatives of the Departments of State, Treasury, and Commerce, the Federal Reserve Board,
the Export-Import Bank, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Similarly we participated in the formulation of a "Statement
of the Foreign Loan and Investment Policy of the United States"
prepared by a joint subcommittee of the National Advisory Council
and of the Executive Committee on Foreign Economic Policy. This
statement has been approved by the President and the Secretary of
State as a guide to the executive agencies of our Government in the
further development of foreign lending programs, to our foreign
missions and to executive agencies in their consultations with foreign
governments and with private investors, and wherever appropriate to
our representatives on international bodies.
The Inter-American Economic Agreement signed on May 2, 1948,
at the Ninth International Conference of American States at Bogota,
Colombia, includes a complete chapter on private investments. The
Commission's representative took an active part in the formulation
of several of the articles in the chapter, in particular with respect to
that portion of the agreement which declares that the policy of the
states is in favor of the development of uniform accounting and disclosure principles. The Commission is lending its technical assistance
in the implementation of the agreement.
Upon the request of the International Monetary Fund and of representatives of the Economic Secretariat of the United Nations, representatives of the Commission have held a number of conferences for
the purpose of helping to develop uniform and current methods of
presenting information with respect to foreign investments and capital markets. Upon invitation of the United States Governor of the
International Bank and the Monetary Fund, the Chairman of the
Commission attended the second annual meetings of these institutions
held in London in September 1947.
At the request of the Chairmen of the Banking and Currency
Committee of the Senate and of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee of the House of Representatives, the Commission considered the proposal of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development that it be granted exemption from the Securities Act of
1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 respecting securities
issued or guaranteed by it.26 In a letter, and in a subsequent statement to the House committee, the Chairman of the Commission indicated the views of the Commission on these proposals. In effect the
Commission stated that, insofar as these proposals affected the country's international economic relations, the Commission was not in a
position to make policy recommendations.
Pursuant to an invitation extended by the Foreign Bondholders'
Protective Council, Inc., the Secretary of State and the Chairman of
.. This proposed legislation contemplated exemption of the above-mentioned securities
from the Securities Act and the Securities Bxcha nge Act. The Thirteenth Annual Report contains a full discussion of the problems involved and of the events leading to the
adoption by the Commission of certam rules and forms specifice.Ily destgned either to grant
exemption from or to facilitate registration under the Securities Act of 1933 for securities

the Securities and Exchange Commission constitute a board of visitors
to the Council. On September 26, 1947, a member of the Commission
and a representative of the Department of State visited the Council
and reviewed its financial operations, its receipts and expenditures,
the nature and the sources of its fees, and discussed several problems
upon which the advice of the visitors was requested by the officers
of the Council. During the year the Council has asked the advice
of the Board of Visitors on several matters involving- the interests of
United States holders of foreign dollar bonds.
The Commission, through the officeof its Adviser on Foreign Investments, maintains a constant surveillance of foreign exchange reg-ulations and capital controls of other countries, noting particularly
the effect of such regulations and controls upon United States investors in foreign securities. One of the Commission's pur'p0ses in
making this review is to be assured that full and accurate disclosure
of these regulations and controls is made in registration statements
and prospectuses used in connection with public offerings of foreign
securities in the United States. The Commission has also on occasion
brought to the notice of the Department of State instances in which
the administration of these controls seemed to involve discriminatory
treatment of United States investors. The Commission also maintains a constant surveillance of the transactions effected by foreigners
in the securities markets under its jurisdiction.
ADVISORY

AND INTERPRETATIVE

ASSISTANCE

References are made throughout this report to the informal assistance rendered by the staff to the public in connection with the statutes
administered by the Commission. Such assistance is usually given
by the staff in connection with specific matters involving the filing
of a registration statement, proxy statement, annual report, and so on.
Mention has been made of the prefiling conference and the deficiency
letter in connection with registration statements. These represent
only a small part of the total of informal assistance given the public
by the staff. It is not possible to determine the exact amount of assistance made available to the public by the staff by means of conference
and letter. At the least, such conferences run into the thousands, and
their number is more than equaled by the number of advisory letters
prepared by the staff during the 1948 fiscal year.
In addition to the above assistance rendered by the staff in connection with specific matters, a great amount of assistance was provided
the public by a special interpretative section in the officeof the chief
counsel of the Division of Corporation Finance. This section is
staffed with lawyers prepared to give expert advice as to all questions
of interpretation arising under the Securities Act of 1933, the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and
parts of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Upon presentation of
all pertinent facts involved in a particular problem, the section will
furnish a detailed and informed opinion as to the application of a particular statute in a specific situation.
During the 1948 fiscal year, the section prepared 5,847 letters furnishing this highly technical assistance at the request of interested
lawyers, accountants, and students. In addition, the section rendered

like assistance in many hundreds of conferences held, in person or by

CONFIDENTIAL

TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS,
OR DOCUMENTS

REPORTS,

The Commission is empowered to grant confidential treatment, upon
application by registrants, to information contained in reports, applications, or documents which they are required to file under the
Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utihty Holding Company Act of ~935, the Investment Company
Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under the
Securities Act of 1933 the Commission has adopted rule 485,27which
provides that information as to material contracts, or portions thereof,
will be held confidential by the Commission if it determines that disclosure would impair the value of the contracts and is not necessary
for the protection of investors. The other four statutes referred to
are, in general, without specific restriction in this respect and empower
the Commission to hold confidential under certain conditions any information contained in any reports required to be filed under those
statutes. Disclosure of information filed confidentially under the
latter statutes is made only when the Commission determmes that disclosure is in the public interest.
The following table indicates the number of applications for confidential treatment received and acted upon during the year, together

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES
Saving Study

The Commission continued its series of quarterly releases on the
volume and composition of saving by individuals in the United States.
These releases show the aggregate volume of individuals' saving,
that is, the increase in their assets less the increase in their liabilities,
exclusive of gains or losses from revaluation of assets. The figures
also show the components contributing to this total, such as changes
in securities, cash, insurance, consumers' indebtedness, and consumers'
durable goods.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Financial Position of Corporations

The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of
all United States corporations, exclusive of banks and insurance companies, was continued. These releases show the principal components
of current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated analysis
of the sources and uses of corporate funds. Semiannual supplementary
tables were also released showing a detailed break-down of current
assets and liabilities for various industry and size groups of corporations registered with the Commission. It is intended in subsequent
reports to present more detailed data on the sources and uses of corporate funds, thus giving an up-to-date analysis of the financial
condition of corporations as well as a complete picture of the volume
and composition of corporate saving.
During the 1948 fiscal year the Commission, together with the
Federal Trade Commission, inaugurated a series of quarterly industrial financial reports. These reports developed as an extension of
the working capital series and present a complete balance sheet and
abbreviated income account for all manufacturing corporations in the
United States. In addition the data are shown for various single
groups of corporations and for minor industry groups. It is planned
that this report be extended to cover nonmanufacturing corporations
as well.
The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, also
continued the series of quarterly releases on the plant and equipment
expenditures by United States businesses other than agriculture.
Shortly after the close of each quarter, these releases present industry
totals on the actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated
expenditures for the next two quarters. It is intended in future reports to present additional data showing more detailed classifications
of industry groups and a size-of-company break-down. These data
provide a useful index of present and future activity in the capitalgoods industries and capital markets and a valuable barometer of
business activity in general.
Stock Market Statistics

Certain releases to the public, supplanted during the war by press
releases because of the manpower and _paper shortage, were reinstated
toward the end of the fiscal year. Round-lot trading and odd-lot
trading releases were consolidated into one weekly public release and
a special mailing list was established for persons desiring these data.
The releases also cover, with a 2-week lag, daily total round-lot
sales in odd lots on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the oddlot dealers' round-lot purchases and sales for their odd-lot accounts.
The releases also cover, with a two-week lag, daily total round-lot
transactions on the New York Stock Exchange and on the New York
Curb Exchange and the round-lot purchases, total sales, and short
sales of exchange member groups, as well as the numbers of reports
received weekly from each class of member.
The Commission continued publication of indexes, by industries,
of weekly closing prices of common stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange; and the monthly dollar value and volume of sales of stocks,
bonds, rights, and warrants on registered and exempted securities ex-

changes. A number of these series are presented III the appendix
tables of this report.
The Commission's staff continued its studies of various aspects of
trading in securities, including floor trading, purchases and sales of
domestic securities for foreign account, purchases and sales of security options, and general research on exchange rules and practices.
Survey of American

Listed Corporations

During the 1948 fiscal year, the Commission again released for
public and Government use statistical data filed with the Commission
by registrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
Securities Act of 1933. These data are summarized in a series of
reports known as the "Survey of American Listed Corporations"
showing individual data for each company as well as industry totals
for 1,825 registered companies in 156 industry groups.
One of the series of reports "Data on Profits and Operations Including Surplus, 1945-46" was completed in the fiscal year. This series,
consisting of seven volumes (divided according to industry groups), is
published annually. The data included are presented on an over-all
basis, covering all registrants, and are then presented on an individual
basis for each of the registrants constituting the group with all figures
given on a comparative basis with the preceding year. Principal
items furnished in these reports on profits and operations including
surplus are annual data on sales; costs and/or operating expenses;
operating profits; net profit before income taxes; net profit after income
taxes; depreciation, depletion, amortization, etc.; maintenance and
repairs; selling, general and administrative expenses; earned surplus
at the beginning of the period; additions to earned surplus (including
net profit after income taxes); deductions from earned surplus (other
than dividends); dividends charged to earned surplus; and earned
surplus at the end of the period. Also included are capital surplus
at the beginning of the period; capital surplus at the end of the period;
and net worth at the beginning of each period covered. In addition
each item in the profit and loss account is shown as a percentage of
net sales and a ratio of the net profit before income taxes as a percentage of net worth and a ratio of the net profit after income taxes
as a percentage of net worth. The data presented for the manufacturing industry groups supplement previous reports on "Data on
Profits and Operations" beginning with the year 1936. The data for
the nonmanufacturing industry groups supplement previous reports
beginning with the year 1942. Surplus is presented for the first time
in this series. A summarization of data on profits and operations for
the period 1937-46 was also publicly released for all manufacturing
companies as well as a summarization of all nonmanufacturing companies for the period from 1942-46. All of these data for registered
corporations, both on an individual company and industry basis, are
currently being carried through 1947.
Investment

Company

Data

Data for closed-end and open-end management investment companies were compiled and released to the public quarterly. These
reports show data for the purchases and sales in both shares and
dollars of the registrant's capital stock and of their own funded debt;
portfolio changes during the period showing purchases, sales and
balance of change in their portfolio; and the nature of their assets

at the close of the quarter. The items included in these assets are
cash and cash items; Government securities; securities of other investment companies; other securities; other assets; and total assets.
Brokers and Dealers

During the 1948 fiscal year, a study was made of the financial
condition of 3,284 registered brokers and dealers reporting under rule
X-17A-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 covering the
years 1946-47. The study consists of tables summarizing the data
for all registrants, for members of the New York Stock Exchange, and
for each of the 10 regions of the Oommission. The items covered in
each of the tables include net capital; aggregate indebtedness; cash
in banks; funds segregated pursuant to Oommodity Exchange Act
requirements; cash and exempt securities segregated; firms' inventory
of exempt securities at market value; firms' inventory of nonexempt
securities at market value; and customers' debit balances in margin
accounts. Also included are customers' free credit balances; customers' credit balances in cash accounts; customers' credit balances
in accounts with open contractual commitments; customers' credit
balances in margin accounts; money borrowed from banks on customers' securities; and money borrowed from banks on firms' and
partners' securities. The study is being carried through 1948 and the
results to date are included as appendix table 6.
Quarterly Sales Data

Data showing quarterly sales of registrants under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 have been released by the Oommission. These
releases have been made in two forms, covering approximately 1,400
corporations in 156 industry groups. The data have been released
each quarter, first in the aggregate showing the total for all companies,
with a break-down of manufacturing and retail trade for the last five
quarters, and secondly for each individual company and for each
industry group for the current quarter, the previous quarter, and the
comparable quarter of the previous year.
Distribution of Registrants by Independent Accounting Firms

During the 1948 fiscal year, a study was made of the distribution of
registrants by independent public accounting firms certifying financial
statements for 1946. The study included 2,265 registrants, with
aggregate assets of 100 billion dollars, filing annual reports with the
Oommission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
Securities Act of 1933. These firms' reports were certified by 416
independent public accounting firms. The study classified the accounting firms by aggregate assets of registrants served, showing the
number of registrants, number of industry groups, and the percentage
of total number of registrants covered. Also shown are a break-down
of accounting firms by interval, the number of firms certified to, and
the aggregate assets of these registrants.
Registrants and Subsidiaries

Another report in the series entitled "Registrants and Subsidiaries"
is currently being carried through 1948. This study shows the relationship between about 2,100 registered companies and their 14,000
subsidiaries.

ANALYSIS OF THE STOCK MARKET DECLINE OF
SEPTEMBER 3, 1946
On August 21, 1947,the Commission released a report of the Division of Trading and Exchanges giving the results of a study started
in October 1946of stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange on
September 3,1946. On that day, stock prices experienced the sharpest break in 9 years. The study was undertaken to determine the
causes of the break and to ascertain whether there had been any
planned or concerted action by any group in violation of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or its rules.
The study analyzed the buying and selling of various types of
buyers and sellers in 15-minute (and in some cases, shorter) periods
throughout the day. It traced prices for each minute of the day and
described the buying and selling in all stocks traded in 100-share lots
and in various classifications of these stocks. It showed what was
being done at given times by public traders, foreigners, banks, investment trusts, odd-lot dealers, member and nonmember firms (for firm
and individual accounts and for wives and dependents), and by floor
traders and specialists. These activities were in turn subdivided into
transactions in all stocks, in stocks graded according to activity and
price, according to their use in standard indices, in stocks with different
rates of decline throughout the day, and in stocks of various industrial
classifications.
For this analysis, two major types of data were collected. First,
every transaction in round lots on the New York Stock Exchange on
September 3 was reconstructed from the brokers' records. Comprehensive information was obtained from New York Stock Exchange
member firms and other brokers and dealers and banks which effected
transactions through the facilities of the Exchange on that day. For
each round-lot purchase and sale, these data included the name of the
stock, price, and volume, and the name and address of the customer.
The sales data also included information with respect to short sales
and stop-loss orders. Second, a number of public customers who either
bought or sold on September 3 were interviewed to obtain further
details on their trading, including their reasons for buying or selling.
Six hundred and twenty-two interviews were conducted, covering
practically all of the largest public purchasers and sellers on that
day, as well as a random sample of all other public transactions.
The study was limited to an analysis of market activity and did
not deal with the general domestic and international economic background of the day's market. Based on a voluminous collection of detailed information, the report gave the most comprehensive picture
of a day's market yet presented. While the report reached no specific
conclusions, no group or individual, professional or public, nor any
single market factor, plainly appears as exclusively or primarily
accountable for the character of the trading on the day in question.
In its release accompanying the report, the Commission stated that,

124

although the study should be helpful in the formulation and evaluation of standards designed to maintain fair and orderly markets, it
alone did not show what further controls, if any, are necessary or
desirable.

PERSONNEL
As of June 30, 1948, the personnel of the Commission consisted
of the following:
Headquarters Office:
Commissioners___________________________________
Staff

5

813

818
331

ltegional offices___________________________________________
Total

1,149

This represents a reduction of 10 employees from the total personnel
on June 30, 1947. Of the 1,144 employees of the Commission at the
end of the current year, 416 or 36 percent were veterans of World
War lor World War II.
In January 1948 the Headquarters Office of the Commission was
removed to Washington, D. C., from Philadelphia, Pa., where it had
been located for nearly 6 years. Among the administrative problems
presented by the return to Washington was the necessity for the
maintenance of operations during the period of the move notwithstanding a considerable turn-over in clerical and stenographic positions. The replacement of those employees unable to move to Washington with the Commission constituted one of the major functions
of the Division of Personnel during the 1948 fiscal year. It is noteworthy, however, that the Commission lost very few of its professional employees during this period. As a matter of fact, approximately 41 percent of the total professional and technical staff has
been with the Commission for 10 years or more.
