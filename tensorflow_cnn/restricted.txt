compensation benefits employee benefits employee benefits are optional non wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their normal wages or salaries these types of benefits may include group insurance health dental vision life etc disability income protection retirement benefits daycare tuition reimbursement sick leave vacation paid and non paid funding of education as well as flexible and alternative work arrangements in this section the benefits of benefits plan the basics health dental life ad d long term disability employee assistance plans eaps retirement benefits indirect non financial compensation the benefits of benefits plans although expensive there are many intrinsic benefits to providing your employees with a comprehensive benefit plan for most it is the ability to find and keep highly qualified staff that is the key driver with the sector being highly competitive and the number of new employees entering the workforce dwindling employers are challenged to become even more creative and responsive in the design timing and generosity of their benefit plans the more progressive the organization the more flexible the structure is in response to today s challenges i e like having four different generations of employees working side by side employers who continue to provide the more traditional and limited program may find it more difficult to find and keep different types of employees here are just a few of the advantages of offering benefits to your employees for employers by providing increased access and flexibility in employee benefits employers can not only recruit but retain qualified employees providing benefits to employees is seen as managing high risk coverage at low costs and easing the company s financial burden employee benefits have been proven to improve productivity because employees are more effective with they are assured of security for themselves and their families premiums are tax deductible as corporation expense which means savings for the organization for employees employees can experience a peace of mind which leads to increased productivity and satisfaction by being assured that they are their families are protected in any mishap employees with personal life and disability insurance can enjoy additional protection including income replacement in the event of serious illness or disability employees can feel a sense of pride in their employer if they are satisfied with the coverage they receive back to top the basics health dental health and dental benefits are considered the foundation of any benefit program design when considering the root issues of all absenteeism from the workplace most employers agree that health or dental related illness is cited most as the cause while many have not thought of dental coverage as being a key attraction point a number of medical reports have been published recently that indicate that many of our common virus and illnesses are actually related to poor dental health an organization s ability to be creative flexible and generous in providing health and dental coverage can be a key to attracting and retaining top performers as part of the total compensation package health even in canada where government plans provide approximately of all healthcare expenses the remaining gap is still perceived as a major concern for employees and employers private healthcare plans are restricted by legislation to expenses not fully covered by government programs organizational health expense plans are generally permitted in the following areas across canada hospital room charges in excess of the standard rate to cover semi private or private accommodation hospital charges for emergency treatment outside canada drugs medication and vaccines and other supplies available only by prescription professional services of a physician for out of country medical expenses professional services for private duty nursing charges for special medical appliances such as crutches artificial limbs or wheelchairs non emergency ambulance services dental treatments not requiring hospitalization professional services provided by licensed paramedicals such as psychologists massage therapists speech therapists podiatrists physiotherapists chiropractors osteopaths or naturopaths vision care expenses including frames and lenses contact lenses fitting and remedial treatment laser eye correction surgery this option is one that many employers struggle to provide their employees with as the number requiring vision care is so great the cost of including this option could raise the employer s costs by anywhere from to it is common practice to include many of the above items under a single extended healthcare plan most benefit carriers will tailor a plan to include only those features and coverage s desired certain items however are often restricted or sold in combination with other coverage s to contain overall plan costs or to subsidize heavily utilized services extended healthcare plan options should be selected based on the organization s overall compensation objectives and employee needs for small organizations the range of coverage options may be limited if the plans are financed on a fully insured basis these plans offer restricted flexibility to limit the occurrence of high risk claims these pre packaged plans are available to small organizations through affiliation with umbrella organizations such as chambers of commerce boards of trade trade associations and professional organizations for larger organizations the range of options is mostly limited by cost considerations dental dental plan design is the art of finding a delicate balance between understanding what the foundational priorities are and allocating sufficient funds to ensure that the coverage is perceived as being sufficient and appropriate although the type of dental work can differ from person to person some common elements have been found most employees their spouses and children require basic preventative dental care and repair therefore most employers elect to design the plan in such a way as to minimize the cost to employees of basic coverage since major restorative care and orthodontics tend to be more elective in nature and less common in need across the employee group than basic services most plans do not provide equal coverage in all areas for example the plan might pay of basic and of the other two categories it is also common to find deductibles co insurance and benefit maximums for the non basic services to free up more funds for the necessary preventive ones high employee deductibles and co insurance percentages can help to limit plan disbursements because employees will be paying more of the total costs the potential problem is that these high employee costs may in effect force postponement of needed dental work until the repair bill is even higher paying of basic preventative care from day one is the overwhelming choice of employers having the dental plan require a pre treatment evaluation for certain expenses helps control cost levels by ensuring that the plan only pays for reasonable treatments it also avoids any misunderstanding by the employee as to what services are covered and how much he or she is required to pay it is always preferable to ensure the employee knows what the plan will pay for and what exact dollar amount is their responsibility a commonly asked question of benefit administrators is why the dental plan is not optional but compulsory if the plan is optional only those employees who are likely to need dental care will sign up they will almost always use services that exceed their contributions deductibles and co insurance those who feel that the benefits will not cover their costs will decline because of this adverse selection cost per employee will be so high that employers would not be perceived as competitive back to top life and ad d most employers design their plans with a provision to protect the employee and or their family in the event of accidental death or dismemberment ad d employers often provide basic coverage as a factor of the employee s salary example the employee s salary in the event of death or total paralysis with additional coverage available should the employee chose to purchase it each employee benefit plan should include a chart that identifies what coverage is available and the associated cost back to top long term disability long term disability is an income replacement provision this is one provision that cannot be purchased through a spousal plan employees are asked to pay the total cost of the premiums in order to receive a tax free payment should they be unable to work long term disability coverage is applied for when an employee is unable to complete a certain percentage of the essential duties of their role due to illness on an ongoing basis the structure of each plan can differ slightly so understanding what you are trying to achieve with this program including elimination periods and termination options is critical at the outset employee assistance plans eaps an eap or employee assistance program is a confidential short term counseling service for employees with personal problems that affect their work performance studies have shown that providing confidential qualified counseling and support can reduce the stress and conflict felt by the employee which in turn can reduce absenteeism and ultimately turnover one on one sessions are offered and online information coaching and support services are also available employees turn to the eap for help with a variety of issues including the following dependent care issues such as searching for child care information identifying services for special needs children obtaining advice on the college application process or arranging for residential care for an elder dealing with the stress of a major life change even a positive one such as having or adopting a child getting married moving or buying a home or getting a promotion serious personal or professional concerns such as general anxiety depression substance abuse burnout coping with illness the loss of a loved one relationship challenges or resolving interpersonal conflicts different types of programs are available to employers to provide employee assistance employers can establish their own in house programs join a consortium of organizations to provide external services or refer employees to public and private providers of this service the range of costs across these options can vary widely organizations must then decide the most advantageous approach to achieve the level of improved wellness among their employees in selecting the best eap provider several factors need to be considered how accessible and convenient are the services to be provided location of offices and confidentially concerns are important here how is the quality of services to be measured how is client satisfaction to be assessed how are service costs to be determined and will there be limits placed on the frequency and extent of services provided what will the charges be per hour of service per individual before choosing an eap provider these questions need to be answered and the answers reflected in any service proposal or contract back to top retirement benefits a retirement plan or a pension is an arrangement by an employer to provide their employees with an income when they are no longer earning a regular income from working retirement plans may be set up by in a variety of ways but typically will have a form of a guaranteed payment often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money into a fund while employed so that they will receive benefits upon retirement pension plans are considered a form of delayed income pension plans pension plans are usually classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the payments are determined a defined benefit plan guarantees a predictable monthly payment at retirement calculated by using an established formula with some combination of the employee s salary years of service and or age a defined contribution plan will provide a payment payout at retirement that will be determined by the amount of money contributed during the life of the plan and the performance of the stock or investments used registered retirement savings plans a registered retirement savings plan or rrsp is an account that provides tax benefits for saving for retirement yet is not necessarily based on the employer employee relationship rrsps can provide ways to save money for retirement and defer and reduce taxes because contributions to rrsps up to established limits may be deducted from income in pre taxed dollars income earned within the account is not taxed until money is withdrawn from the plan rrsp accounts can be setup with as either individual rrsp an individual rrsp is associated with only a single individual only they contribute money to their rrsp spousal rrsp the spouse of the contributor is actually the account holder a spousal rrsp is a means of splitting income in retirement group rrsp an employer can arrange for employees to make contributions through a schedule of regular payroll deductions in many organizations rrsp contributions can be based on a matching program this means that the employer will put in a certain percentage or dollar amount based on the contributions the employee makes the employee gets to receive the tax savings immediately at the time of deduction instead of having to wait until the end of the tax year phased retirement today s work place is challenged with having up to four different generations working side by side for most employers designing a compensation and benefit structure that address the unique needs of each demographic group is a complex task added to that is the shift in pension structures over the past few years some non profit organizations provide their employees with a pension fund however most tend to offer only contributions to an rrsp this leads to an increasing number of employees not feeling able to retire it is important that organizations understand the details of their pension plan whether it is a defined benefit or contribution or simply an rrsp program before considering design changes for those not hindered by a design change one option that is gaining in popularity especially in this sector is providing a phased retirement program for older skilled employees for employees components of the phased program are allowing employees who might be considering retiring to delay their departure date continue to earn a partial income that reduces the burden on their pension income they continue to receive benefit coverage and are able to acclimate gradually by continuing to reduce their hours until they are prepared to leave for employers employers are able to develop a timely and effective succession plan without losing critical skills or intellectual capital organizations benefit by being able to tap into the most experienced staff at a reduced salary while transitioning to a new team or organizational design hurdles employees need to understand the impact continuing to work may have on pension or benefit programs also to be considered is the timing of starting your phased approach if an employee starts too soon they might not have accumulated enough to compensate for the reduced salary employers need to be sure that the phased retirement program is structured in a way that will not diminish the work of the organization or the financial position of the employee back to top indirect non financial compensation indirect compensation will look different in every organization ultimately it is the way in which you choose to define the culture of your organization and your total compensation rewards program that will differentiate it of course it is important to ensure it aligns with organizational strategic objectives recent studies all indicate that in today s changing work environment it is the flexibility and creativity that draws and keeps the highly skilled employee benefit perspective from a benefit perspective being creative and considering ways to improve the access or quality of your benefits could look like allowing employees to access their benefit as of their hire date being able to accumulate sick days to bridge to disability coverage being able to use some sick days as personal health days to allow employees to have a break without using all their holidays or pretending to be sick receiving your birthday off with pay eliminating the probationary period language from contracts offer letters seeking insurance providers with vision care benefits at reasonable costs allowing for some increased flexibility in personalizing benefit options i e health spending accounts vision care versus dental and more paramedical coverage although these options have a cost associated with them the cost is significantly less than the benefit an organization can reap in return if your insurance provider does not allow you the freedom to make some adjustments in your plan then it might be time to research what else is available other perspectives many articles have been written highlighting the keys to creating the best organization and to finding and keeping the best employees in recent studies the following were identified as key factors compensation paying employees fairly against both the market conditions as well as ensuring internal equity was still the number one factor considered providing clear information on the organization s compensation structure and consistent processes were critical to an employee s sense of commitment professional development for many people especially the younger generations the ability to develop both personally and professionally was highly valued and a key consideration deciding where to work access to training and development on the job and through courses or conferences were listed in a study done by the conference board of canada as important another variation of this was receiving reimbursement for courses taken on the employee s own time most commonly reimbursed were courses that aligned with a professional designation in the employees current role culture employees who were surveyed and asked what kept them in their current role indicated that having a culture that recognized the importance of connecting performance to rewards were key to their satisfaction performance management was one component that influenced the culture having clearly defined expectations being able to identify goals to work towards and having their evaluation align with those agreed to goals contributed to higher satisfaction levels receiving effective and realistic feedback both positive and constructive increased a continuous learning environment and increases commitment to the organization because performance both good and bad is recognized succession planning when operating within an organization brings a sense of purpose and sustainability to employees confidence in the future and their role it in was reported consistently by those who had been identified for a succession plan consider ways to develop younger staff with great potential by having them be identified as a potential successor to a long term employee the employee wins by learning new and critical skills while feeling rewarded for their hard work to date the more senior person feels rewarded for years of service and identified as a key contributor the organization wins by ensuring that intellectual capital is not lost but transitioned from one employee to another trust demonstrated as part of the culture of an organization is highly valued by all generations of employees in steven covey s book moving at the speed of trust leaders are challenged to evaluate if their organization s culture is one of trust or mistrust employees who feel trusted and respected will strive harder to maintain that trust and are less likely to do something that will result in a loss of trust workplace flexibility alternative work arrangements are effective ways to negotiate an arrangement that meet the needs of the organization while also providing employees will what they need to balance their home and work environments listed below are just some of the ideas that could be explored finding out what your organization would value can start this process the key is to ensure that any alternative arrangements considered do not hinder the organization s ability to ensure that core work is being completed in the time and manner required to maintain sustainability having clear expectations on both the organization and the employee s part as to the terms and conditions of the alternative work arrangement can prevent ineffective or damaging results flexible time this can be establishing core hours then allowing employees to work earlier in the day or later in the day example core hours are to person a starts at and works till person b works from to seasonal hours can be established in a variety of terms just as flexible hours schedule of part time employees example hiring a part time person to work days a week or a but they actually work full time for months a year and then take a combination of their time vacation and hours and take a month in the summer and a month in the winter off work they would continue to receive the salary for months a year compressed work week allowing an employee to work their full number of hours in less days example core hours are hours per week the employee works hours days instead of hour days job sharing having qualified employees share the duties and tasks of one position both could work days or alternative between days one week and the next the advantage of job sharing is having people who both know the role the downside can be having a communication gap between individuals doing the role consider having an employee who is contemplating retirement job share with a more junior employee with high potential transition knowledge skills and commitment telecommuting this is the practice of allowing an employee work from their home location instead of on your premises there are guidelines governing the considerations for this type of employment in the past ten years the number of people telecommuting has tripled with results indicating that increased productivity and effectiveness were seen from this type of working arrangement regular part time work many people today are looking for meaningful work but on a part time basis a desire to balance work and life priorities has increased exponentially over the past decade and employers who recognize the contribution part time employees can make are leading their organizations forward educational partnership many employees are looking for opportunities to balance academic pursuits with employment opportunities considering how you could structure a role for a person in the final stages of their education could result in an increased pool of potential employees and employees who will be loyal to an organization that provided with them practical experience and the ability to create a flexible schedule regardless of whether you are developing an alternative work arrangement or increasing the flexibility of your benefit program it is important to understand what motivates employees and what culture you are building in your organization the better able you are to align the two together the increased success you will have

and processes that country teams have in place the extent to which the administrative burden and transaction costs can be further reduced will be contingent upon introduction of parallel initiatives on for example common business practices and expenditure reporting which are being addressed under other undg processes these initiatives once implemented will help to provide clarity and reduce the

flexibility to country teams in developing a coherent approach that is a responsive to country needs b fits with the context within which country teams operate and c the level of capacity existing within country teams to support those who will lead the development of the reporting approach and unct management hyperlinks to examples from existing results reports and other relevant un guidance are provided in the annexes the guidance on the undaf progress report is consistent with the undaf guidelines for country teams entitled how to prepare an undaf part i guidelines for un country teams and part ii technical guidance for un country teams according to the undaf guidelines the unct and the government must conduct an annual review of the undaf while it is essential that the annual review process is documented an annual progress report is not mandatory however as a minimum a single undaf progress report must be produced per undaf cycle the following is a summary of the contents of the different parts of the guidance part elaborates key principles that the unct should consider part identifies the purpose of the undaf progress report part presents the standard operating format structure that uncts should use to develop the undaf progress report part outlines the annual review process to develop the analysis and narrative for the sections of the undaf progress report and additional material and good practice examples are annexed unct refers to representatives of the un funds programmes and specialized agencies and other un entities accredited to a given country it could also include representatives of the bretton woods institutions a undaf annual review process and annual review reporting good practice study report produced for the undg september and b mapping exercise and analysis of agency annual report requirements june standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf principles a the tcpr requests that the resident coordinator supported by the united nations country team should report to national authorities on progress made against results agreed in the united nations development assistance framework this request was reiterated in paragraph of the ecosoc resolution which further requested that the secretary general through the united nations development group and its member agencies develop a standard operational format for reporting for this purpose bearing in mind the need to reduce administrative burden and transaction costs the undg interprets the above to mean that country teams must produce a report to national authorities on progress towards the undaf results at least once during the undaf cycle however the option remains open for the unct to decide in consultation with government and other key partners to produce more than a single undaf progress report per undaf cycle if this will add value b the undaf progress report should focus on reporting the un s contribution to results at the undaf outcome level results should be reported at the undaf outcome level with discussion of the evidence of the un s contribution towards these results outcomes describe the intended changes in development conditions and normally relate to changes in institutional performance or behaviour among individuals or groups which partially result from unct cooperation the report should not discuss un supported activities it should only report on outputs in terms of how their achievement has contributed to the outcomes defined in the undaf results framework c the undaf progress report is a tool to enhance mutual accountability with national authorities the report is intended to contribute to the un s response to the wider aid effectiveness agenda by supporting greater mutual accountability between the un and member states at country level d the unct and government are required to have clear agreement on how the undaf progress report is to be used and the frequency of reporting un agencies and their partners remain accountable for the performance of individual projects and programmes and the undaf progress report does not blur this existing line of accountability the unct and government agree on how the undaf progress report is to be used to reinforce mutual accountability for progress towards undaf outcomes and any other uses of the report as a minimum a single undaf progress report must be produced per undaf cycle with the timing to be agreed between the country team and national authorities the option remains open for the unct to decide in consultation with government and other key partners to produce more than a single undaf progress report per undaf cycle if this will add value delivering as one countries are currently required to report annually mutual accountability has become established as a consideration of development and aid effectiveness although questions remain on its actual implications for the purpose of the undaf progress report mutual accountability is interpreted to mean the respective accountability of parties working together towards shared outcomes this notion of respective accountability reflects the fact that accountability is not fungible and must in the final analysis be attached to a specific actor many stakeholders contribute to undaf outcomes and each is accountable for its contribution the undaf progress report will focus on unct contributions to these outcomes and as such will address the respective accountability at the outcome level of each unct the suggestion is that the undaf progress report would have the maximum impact if produced in the first quarter of the last year of the undaf cycle this will maximize the use of undaf evaluation work normally carried out in the penultimate year first the context analysis can draw upon the common country analysis work carried out in the penultimate year second the annual review and undaf design processes in the penultimate year will both provide analysis of the relevance of the un s support and contribution and agreement with the government on lessons learned and the way forward finally the undaf evaluation would enhance the credibility of results reported as it would provide an impartial assessment of the evidence of the un s contribution and much of the narrative needed in the undaf progress report on the un s contribution by outcome standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf e reporting is an integral part of a comprehensive and strategic undaf planning and programming cycle which supports informed evidence based decision making the credibility of the results reported will depend on how well the undaf planning and annual review systems operate the annual review process should inform and provide inputs for the undaf progress report ideally an undaf process reflects strong links to national priorities and national ownership of the undaf an approach based on the current undaf guidelines or country specific modifications un staff ownership of the undaf and strong support for the annual review process and undaf progress reporting by the unct involvement of both national authorities and unct members including specialized and non resident agencies simplified procedures and reduced transaction costs for partners including government a scale of effort appropriate for the country programme a strong results based management rbm approach examining results areas and indicators against the work that has been done the outputs and outcomes and utilizing a credible monitoring and evaluation m e plan and modification of the undaf based on periodic reviews and evaluations and undaf programming principles particularly the principle of human rights based approach as established by the un and specialized agencies f strong engagement and ownership by national partners and the unct are critical strong engagement ownership and leadership are required from both national authorities and the unct in order to develop an undaf progress report unity of purpose and commitment within the unct as well as the participation of national partners are vital g uncts have the flexibility to decide what and how much information is presented in the undaf progress report the undaf progress report should be short and focused on reporting results at a strategic level in order to minimize transaction costs and enhance clarity and value the standard operational format is applicable to most country situations since the areas of focus are generic the amount of narrative and evidence presented is decided by the unct in consultation with the national authorities and would reflect the performance information available this will depend on the stage of the undaf cycle and the amount of analysis available from either the unct i e undaf end of cycle or other evaluations or the national authorities and other stakeholders h maximize use of data from existing reporting systems wherever possible to assess progress towards outcomes the unct will rely on data from national systems where available uncts determine how far outputs have been achieved and how far they are likely to contribute to the outcomes in doing so uncts also maximize the use of performance data from project programme performance assessments the rc annual report and any process for reviewing un reform universal rights are part of each member state s commitments under the un charter the constitutions of the specialized agencies and related declarations and conventions each stage of the programming cycle should ensure that adherence to such principles and rights is promoted by the unct reporting should include measurement of progress on principles and rights the format is also applicable in post conflict situations where the un has developed a transition plan however uncts should have flexibility to decide how to report on the un s humanitarian response where relevant standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf purpose of the undaf progress report the undaf progress report serves as a tool to show progress towards achieving national development priorities supported by the undaf and thereby enhances mutual accountability the unct consults with national authorities to ensure that they share common expectations on how the undaf progress report will be used where the added value in enhancing mutual accountability will be gained and when in the undaf cycle the report s will be produced in fostering mutual accountability the unct government and other key partners share key results to which they contribute in this context it is important to remember that it is during the annual review process that the unct primarily engages with government and other partners based on the use of robust performance information to increase informed decision making and identify detailed commitments for the coming year the undaf progress report will be accessible to a range of stakeholders both within the national authorities and more widely the added value of the undaf progress report may therefore come through increased transparency as it will become the single point of reference on what has been achieved at the undaf outcome level and the un s contribution since countries face different circumstances the unct in consultation with the national authorities can identify whether the report might meet additional needs suggestions of additional purposes that might be considered include a increasing information sharing b increasing ownership of shared outcomes between the national authorities other stakeholders and the united nations c strengthening the strategic management cycle for the undaf by linking assessments of performance lessons learned and decisions on how the overall programme might be adjusted d documenting agreed revisions of the undaf results framework and consequently changes adaptations for which the un may be held accountable and e reporting on implementation of key un reform at country level and how the reform enhances un coherence and effectiveness standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf this section provides an outline of the standard operational format for the undaf progress report the format includes the following five sections and required annexes i introduction length pages what should be covered state the purpose agreed with the government for the undaf progress report and summarize the process for developing the report briefly describe how relevant national strategies the poverty reduction strategy paper prsp and sector wide approaches swaps if relevant link to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals including the millennium development goals

undaf progress report and describe any revisions of the undaf that occurred during the reporting period identify the un agencies for which results are included and any changes in agency roles that have affected undaf reporting and cross reference to annex which should include definitions of key terms to assist non un stakeholders unfamiliar with them ii key development trends length pages what should be covered key changes during the reporting period that have affected the development context in which the undaf has been implemented and external trends that affected the risks and assumptions made on what needed to be in place for the un s support to be effective i e political changes and emerging priorities that significantly changed policy focus disasters either humanitarian or natural significant shifts in international prices etc iii progress towards the undaf outcomes and the un s contribution length suggested pages per undaf outcome what should be covered under each separate undaf outcome a summary of progress in achieving the outcome against the established baselines and targets for each outcome this information should be normally drawn from information found in the government s reporting and data collection systems a narrative report assessing the un s contribution to achieving progress against the undaf outcomes based on the annual reviews and where possible end of cycle reviews by an inter agency group responsible for m e or equivalent the narrative report should focus on a i describing the strategic contribution of concerned un agencies and ii whether there is evidence that the contribution has been greater thanks to better coherence between the agency outputs there is no need to report on activities under projects and programmes and un outputs should only be identified in terms of how their achievement has contributed to a significant change at undaf outcome level it should also focus on standard operational format for the undaf progress report the minimum number of annexes that should be appended to the undaf progress report is given in annex vi standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf tcpr guidance on the contribution of un operational activities to national capacity development and development effectiveness including contributions to i capacity building ii south south cooperation and development of national capacities iii gender equality and women s empowerment and iv transition from relief to development as appropriate to each country context b outcome level quantitative indicators rarely track performance under each of the un s five inter related programming principles namely human rights gender equality environmental sustainability results based management and capacity development the narrative report on the un s contribution however must include an assessment of the degree to which these five principles have been reflected in the un s overall contribution and towards making progress against undaf outcomes or other cross cutting issues relevant to the country c identifying advocacy successes of the united nations that have led to the government increasing its commitment or prioritizing achievement of internationally agreed normative standards relevant to the undaf outcome d presenting evidence showing that the un s planned support remains relevant to the country context and national priorities e describing progress on the implementation or realization of principles rights or other normative standards iv progress on un reform length pages maximum what should be included a narrative identifying what the unct planned in this area for the reporting period and the degree to which these intentions have been met a review of any improved functioning of the un development system in line with tcpr guidance in terms of a coherence effectiveness and relevance and b country level capacity of the un development system assessment of progress against agreed benchmarks and results where agreed v lessons learned and way forward length pages maximum what should be covered remember that this section addresses issues at the unct level and therefore should not focus on what is happening within agency specific projects and programmes where accountability remains with the individual un agencies and their partners building on the deliberations during the annual review process the narrative should cover the following issues a changes in major planning assumptions risks and emerging opportunities b continued relevance of undaf outcomes and outputs to national priorities and broader country context c corresponding adjustments to expected results country programme outputs d revisions to strategies planned activities partnerships and resource allocations and identification of those responsible for these changes and e any agreed changes in the undaf results matrix standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf vi annexes to the report annex description of the annual review process what should be covered describe the annual review processes undertaken and how they fed in to the progress report explain the annual review and coordination mechanisms that have been put in place by the un and the government and the efficacy of their use compared with what is proposed in un guidance on the annual review process and assess the degree to which the process has been inclusive including both non resident and specialized agencies and how the unct might strengthen this aspect in the future annex definitions what should be covered provide key definitions particularly for non un stakeholders and a listing of acronyms used annex indicative and provisional programme expenditures what should be covered report on provisional expenditure across the whole un at country level identify continued funding gaps against the indicative budget framework found in the undaf and discuss transaction costs and efficiency where appropriate as per tcpr reporting requirements standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf figure illustrates how the information needed to complete the various sections of the undaf progress report can be developed as part of the annual review process particularly the sections outlined above on reporting progress against undaf outcomes the un s contribution and progress on un reform according to the undaf guidelines the undaf annual review process is to be aligned with the review of the national development plan to the extent possible the agency specific annual review processes would contribute to the undaf annual review the annual review process is where the unct primarily engages with government and other partners to review overall progress towards results and takes stock of lessons and good practices that feed into the annual planning processes and commitments for the coming year in order to facilitate the undaf annual review process the unct engages with national review mechanisms where such mechanisms exist for monitoring the national development priorities and or forms interagency groups around each national development priority reflected in the undaf as shown in figure a unct may follow a three step process for conducting an undaf annual review in step agency specific annual consultations take place on their individual programmes projects to review and agree on progress made including on the related undaf outputs the results of these consultations will feed into step in step inter agency groups responsible for m e track the un s contribution towards undaf outcome level results the m e groups prepare assessment reports by undaf outcome area describing the progress made towards the undaf outcome and key un s contributions as per section iii of the format this leads to step where a high level consultation with the government and other partners takes place to review overall progress this is a once a year opportunity for all agencies and national partners to interact and review the collective contribution of the un to national priorities based on the undaf at this meeting key lessons learned and the way forward is agreed and document as per section v of the format the consultative process at all levels of the undaf results chain should provide agencies and their national counterparts with an opportunity to assess and make recommendations related to the planning assumptions risks and emerging opportunities continued relevance of the undaf results to national priorities and any revisions to the planned undaf results at various levels including the related strategies partnerships and resource allocations any adjustments to the undaf outcomes and outputs will need to be made to the corresponding inter agency and agency documents to maintain consistency and alignment in a given year when the undaf progress report is being developed the annual reviews of the current and previous years as appropriate would help to generate different sections of the progress report particularly sections iii and v the recent good practice study on undaf annual review process and annual review reporting and consultation during the development of this guidance identified a number of examples and approaches that uncts could consider in strengthening their annual review process based on field requests these are summarized in annex and include hyperlinks to relevant country level examples an example of contribution analysis is presented in annex more examples will continue to be compiled

undaf progress report an example of what an inter agency group responsible for m e might report in terms of the un s contribution is shown below based on the experience of the un in rwanda and shows that contribution does not necessarily require large amounts of data as illustrated below the following points should be noted the government s overall goal is to build a knowledge based economy in rwanda following good practice the undaf outcome to which the un is contributing is shared between the un and government and other partners the government would provide the data on primary school completion rates the undaf output which in this example is shared by four un agencies describes what the un s contribution would be to achieving the related undaf outcome and the four un agencies contributing to this undaf output have also developed agency specific outputs which would be reviewed as part of the regular projects programmes m e processes the contribution analysis would then provide narrative evidence against the following questions have the four un agencies delivered their specific outputs and on schedule note that each agency is accountable for its output and the un programme officers should know the performance at this level if all four un agencies delivered their outputs on time were these successfully integrated into a single model note this is where you would look for synergy and coherence between the outputs of the four involved agencies and the added value of a common country programming approach if the un delivered its undaf output what evidence is there that the model will be implemented in this case the main evidence would be that the model was accepted by the government and funding for its rollout nationwide was put in place again if it is clear what others are expected to do this should not require collecting new data to answer if over the next to years the government reports a positive shift in the school completion rates what evidence is there that this is partly due to the un s contribution the model in this case the government piloted the model and evaluated its affects on primary school completion rates and found that there was strong evidence that the model for education proposed would have the intended effects upon completion rates annex an example of assessing the un s contribution standard operational format

office utilizes unex and expense categories agreed to by the undg in prior to the development of an automated un system wide tool to facilitate the development of integrated reports other undg work streams have to ensure a consistent linking of programme expenditure in financial reporting systems to undaf outcomes by all relevant un agencies and b application of harmonized practices for cost classification across all un agencies the latter is soon to be reviewed by the undg and reissued on the basis of the agreement until the above has been implemented it is recommended that this part of the report focus on considering adopting the approach to reporting programme expenditure reflected in the examples provided in annex for those agencies that do not currently have a system that links expenditures in their work plan or the equivalent to the undaf outcomes a simple way of making such a link is shown in figure below experience suggests that while this takes considerable effort initially it does reduce the subsequent burden on uncts allowing them to focus on substantive analysis for the report introducing such a system should facilitate the preparation of reports against

compensation benefits employee benefits employee benefits are optional non wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their normal wages or salaries these types of benefits may include group insurance health dental vision life etc disability income protection retirement benefits daycare tuition reimbursement sick leave vacation paid and non paid funding of education as well as flexible and alternative work arrangements in this section the benefits of benefits plan the basics health dental life ad d long term disability employee assistance plans eaps retirement benefits indirect non financial compensation the benefits of benefits plans although expensive there are many intrinsic benefits to providing your employees with a comprehensive benefit plan for most it is the ability to find and keep highly qualified staff that is the key driver with the sector being highly competitive and the number of new employees entering the workforce dwindling employers are challenged to become even more creative and responsive in the design timing and generosity of their benefit plans the more progressive the organization the more flexible the structure is in response to today s challenges i e like having four different generations of employees working side by side employers who continue to provide the more traditional and limited program may find it more difficult to find and keep different types of employees here are just a few of the advantages of offering benefits to your employees for employers by providing increased access and flexibility in employee benefits employers can not only recruit but retain qualified employees providing benefits to employees is seen as managing high risk coverage at low costs and easing the company s financial burden employee benefits have been proven to improve productivity because employees are more effective with they are assured of security for themselves and their families premiums are tax deductible as corporation expense which means savings for the organization for employees employees can experience a peace of mind which leads to increased productivity and satisfaction by being assured that they are their families are protected in any mishap employees with personal life and disability insurance can enjoy additional protection including income replacement in the event of serious illness or disability employees can feel a sense of pride in their employer if they are satisfied with the coverage they receive back to top the basics health dental health and dental benefits are considered the foundation of any benefit program design when considering the root issues of all absenteeism from the workplace most employers agree that health or dental related illness is cited most as the cause while many have not thought of dental coverage as being a key attraction point a number of medical reports have been published recently that indicate that many of our common virus and illnesses are actually related to poor dental health an organization s ability to be creative flexible and generous in providing health and dental coverage can be a key to attracting and retaining top performers as part of the total compensation package health even in canada where government plans provide approximately of all healthcare expenses the remaining gap is still perceived as a major concern for employees and employers private healthcare plans are restricted by legislation to expenses not fully covered by government programs organizational health expense plans are generally permitted in the following areas across canada hospital room charges in excess of the standard rate to cover semi private or private accommodation hospital charges for emergency treatment outside canada drugs medication and vaccines and other supplies available only by prescription professional services of a physician for out of country medical expenses professional services for private duty nursing charges for special medical appliances such as crutches artificial limbs or wheelchairs non emergency ambulance services dental treatments not requiring hospitalization professional services provided by licensed paramedicals such as psychologists massage therapists speech therapists podiatrists physiotherapists chiropractors osteopaths or naturopaths vision care expenses including frames and lenses contact lenses fitting and remedial treatment laser eye correction surgery this option is one that many employers struggle to provide their employees with as the number requiring vision care is so great the cost of including this option could raise the employer s costs by anywhere from to it is common practice to include many of the above items under a single extended healthcare plan most benefit carriers will tailor a plan to include only those features and coverage s desired certain items however are often restricted or sold in combination with other coverage s to contain overall plan costs or to subsidize heavily utilized services extended healthcare plan options should be selected based on the organization s overall compensation objectives and employee needs for small organizations the range of coverage options may be limited if the plans are financed on a fully insured basis these plans offer restricted flexibility to limit the occurrence of high risk claims these pre packaged plans are available to small organizations through affiliation with umbrella organizations such as chambers of commerce boards of trade trade associations and professional organizations for larger organizations the range of options is mostly limited by cost considerations dental dental plan design is the art of finding a delicate balance between understanding what the foundational priorities are and allocating sufficient funds to ensure that the coverage is perceived as being sufficient and appropriate although the type of dental work can differ from person to person some common elements have been found most employees their spouses and children require basic preventative dental care and repair therefore most employers elect to design the plan in such a way as to minimize the cost to employees of basic coverage since major restorative care and orthodontics tend to be more elective in nature and less common in need across the employee group than basic services most plans do not provide equal coverage in all areas for example the plan might pay of basic and of the other two categories it is also common to find deductibles co insurance and benefit maximums for the non basic services to free up more funds for the necessary preventive ones high employee deductibles and co insurance percentages can help to limit plan disbursements because employees will be paying more of the total costs the potential problem is that these high employee costs may in effect force postponement of needed dental work until the repair bill is even higher paying of basic preventative care from day one is the overwhelming choice of employers having the dental plan require a pre treatment evaluation for certain expenses helps control cost levels by ensuring that the plan only pays for reasonable treatments it also avoids any misunderstanding by the employee as to what services are covered and how much he or she is required to pay it is always preferable to ensure the employee knows what the plan will pay for and what exact dollar amount is their responsibility a commonly asked question of benefit administrators is why the dental plan is not optional but compulsory if the plan is optional only those employees who are likely to need dental care will sign up they will almost always use services that exceed their contributions deductibles and co insurance those who feel that the benefits will not cover their costs will decline because of this adverse selection cost per employee will be so high that employers would not be perceived as competitive back to top life and ad d most employers design their plans with a provision to protect the employee and or their family in the event of accidental death or dismemberment ad d employers often provide basic coverage as a factor of the employee s salary example the employee s salary in the event of death or total paralysis with additional coverage available should the employee chose to purchase it each employee benefit plan should include a chart that identifies what coverage is available and the associated cost back to top long term disability long term disability is an income replacement provision this is one provision that cannot be purchased through a spousal plan employees are asked to pay the total cost of the premiums in order to receive a tax free payment should they be unable to work long term disability coverage is applied for when an employee is unable to complete a certain percentage of the essential duties of their role due to illness on an ongoing basis the structure of each plan can differ slightly so understanding what you are trying to achieve with this program including elimination periods and termination options is critical at the outset employee assistance plans eaps an eap or employee assistance program is a confidential short term counseling service for employees with personal problems that affect their work performance studies have shown that providing confidential qualified counseling and support can reduce the stress and conflict felt by the employee which in turn can reduce absenteeism and ultimately turnover one on one sessions are offered and online information coaching and support services are also available employees turn to the eap for help with a variety of issues including the following dependent care issues such as searching for child care information identifying services for special needs children obtaining advice on the college application process or arranging for residential care for an elder dealing with the stress of a major life change even a positive one such as having or adopting a child getting married moving or buying a home or getting a promotion serious personal or professional concerns such as general anxiety depression substance abuse burnout coping with illness the loss of a loved one relationship challenges or resolving interpersonal conflicts different types of programs are available to employers to provide employee assistance employers can establish their own in house programs join a consortium of organizations to provide external services or refer employees to public and private providers of this service the range of costs across these options can vary widely organizations must then decide the most advantageous approach to achieve the level of improved wellness among their employees in selecting the best eap provider several factors need to be considered how accessible and convenient are the services to be provided location of offices and confidentially concerns are important here how is the quality of services to be measured how is client satisfaction to be assessed how are service costs to be determined and will there be limits placed on the frequency and extent of services provided what will the charges be per hour of service per individual before choosing an eap provider these questions need to be answered and the answers reflected in any service proposal or contract back to top retirement benefits a retirement plan or a pension is an arrangement by an employer to provide their employees with an income when they are no longer earning a regular income from working retirement plans may be set up by in a variety of ways but typically will have a form of a guaranteed payment often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money into a fund while employed so that they will receive benefits upon retirement pension plans are considered a form of delayed income pension plans pension plans are usually classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the payments are determined a defined benefit plan guarantees a predictable monthly payment at retirement calculated by using an established formula with some combination of the employee s salary years of service and or age a defined contribution plan will provide a payment payout at retirement that will be determined by the amount of money contributed during the life of the plan and the performance of the stock or investments used registered retirement savings plans a registered retirement savings plan or rrsp is an account that provides tax benefits for saving for retirement yet is not necessarily based on the employer employee relationship rrsps can provide ways to save money for retirement and defer and reduce taxes because contributions to rrsps up to established limits may be deducted from income in pre taxed dollars income earned within the account is not taxed until money is withdrawn from the plan rrsp accounts can be setup with as either individual rrsp an individual rrsp is associated with only a single individual only they contribute money to their rrsp spousal rrsp the spouse of the contributor is actually the account holder a spousal rrsp is a means of splitting income in retirement group rrsp an employer can arrange for employees to make contributions through a schedule of regular payroll deductions in many organizations rrsp contributions can be based on a matching program this means that the employer will put in a certain percentage or dollar amount based on the contributions the employee makes the employee gets to receive the tax savings immediately at the time of deduction instead of having to wait until the end of the tax year phased retirement today s work place is challenged with having up to four different generations working side by side for most employers designing a compensation and benefit structure that address the unique needs of each demographic group is a complex task added to that is the shift in pension structures over the past few years some non profit organizations provide their employees with a pension fund however most tend to offer only contributions to an rrsp this leads to an increasing number of employees not feeling able to retire it is important that organizations understand the details of their pension plan whether it is a defined benefit or contribution or simply an rrsp program before considering design changes for those not hindered by a design change one option that is gaining in popularity especially in this sector is providing a phased retirement program for older skilled employees for employees components of the phased program are allowing employees who might be considering retiring to delay their departure date continue to earn a partial income that reduces the burden on their pension income they continue to receive benefit coverage and are able to acclimate gradually by continuing to reduce their hours until they are prepared to leave for employers employers are able to develop a timely and effective succession plan without losing critical skills or intellectual capital organizations benefit by being able to tap into the most experienced staff at a reduced salary while transitioning to a new team or organizational design hurdles employees need to understand the impact continuing to work may have on pension or benefit programs also to be considered is the timing of starting your phased approach if an employee starts too soon they might not have accumulated enough to compensate for the reduced salary employers need to be sure that the phased retirement program is structured in a way that will not diminish the work of the organization or the financial position of the employee back to top indirect non financial compensation indirect compensation will look different in every organization ultimately it is the way in which you choose to define the culture of your organization and your total compensation rewards program that will differentiate it of course it is important to ensure it aligns with organizational strategic objectives recent studies all indicate that in today s changing work environment it is the flexibility and creativity that draws and keeps the highly skilled employee benefit perspective from a benefit perspective being creative and considering ways to improve the access or quality of your benefits could look like allowing employees to access their benefit as of their hire date being able to accumulate sick days to bridge to disability coverage being able to use some sick days as personal health days to allow employees to have a break without using all their holidays or pretending to be sick receiving your birthday off with pay eliminating the probationary period language from contracts offer letters seeking insurance providers with vision care benefits at reasonable costs allowing for some increased flexibility in personalizing benefit options i e health spending accounts vision care versus dental and more paramedical coverage although these options have a cost associated with them the cost is significantly less than the benefit an organization can reap in return if your insurance provider does not allow you the freedom to make some adjustments in your plan then it might be time to research what else is available other perspectives many articles have been written highlighting the keys to creating the best organization and to finding and keeping the best employees in recent studies the following were identified as key factors compensation paying employees fairly against both the market conditions as well as ensuring internal equity was still the number one factor considered providing clear information on the organization s compensation structure and consistent processes were critical to an employee s sense of commitment professional development for many people especially the younger generations the ability to develop both personally and professionally was highly valued and a key consideration deciding where to work access to training and development on the job and through courses or conferences were listed in a study done by the conference board of canada as important another variation of this was receiving reimbursement for courses taken on the employee s own time most commonly reimbursed were courses that aligned with a professional designation in the employees current role culture employees who were surveyed and asked what kept them in their current role indicated that having a culture that recognized the importance of connecting performance to rewards were key to their satisfaction performance management was one component that influenced the culture having clearly defined expectations being able to identify goals to work towards and having their evaluation align with those agreed to goals contributed to higher satisfaction levels receiving effective and realistic feedback both positive and constructive increased a continuous learning environment and increases commitment to the organization because performance both good and bad is recognized succession planning when operating within an organization brings a sense of purpose and sustainability to employees confidence in the future and their role it in was reported consistently by those who had been identified for a succession plan consider ways to develop younger staff with great potential by having them be identified as a potential successor to a long term employee the employee wins by learning new and critical skills while feeling rewarded for their hard work to date the more senior person feels rewarded for years of service and identified as a key contributor the organization wins by ensuring that intellectual capital is not lost but transitioned from one employee to another trust demonstrated as part of the culture of an organization is highly valued by all generations of employees in steven covey s book moving at the speed of trust leaders are challenged to evaluate if their organization s culture is one of trust or mistrust employees who feel trusted and respected will strive harder to maintain that trust and are less likely to do something that will result in a loss of trust workplace flexibility alternative work arrangements are effective ways to negotiate an arrangement that meet the needs of the organization while also providing employees will what they need to balance their home and work environments listed below are just some of the ideas that could be explored finding out what your organization would value can start this process the key is to ensure that any alternative arrangements considered do not hinder the organization s ability to ensure that core work is being completed in the time and manner required to maintain sustainability having clear expectations on both the organization and the employee s part as to the terms and conditions of the alternative work arrangement can prevent ineffective or damaging results flexible time this can be establishing core hours then allowing employees to work earlier in the day or later in the day example core hours are to person a starts at and works till person b works from to seasonal hours can be established in a variety of terms just as flexible hours schedule of part time employees example hiring a part time person to work days a week or a but they actually work full time for months a year and then take a combination of their time vacation and hours and take a month in the summer and a month in the winter off work they would continue to receive the salary for months a year compressed work week allowing an employee to work their full number of hours in less days example core hours are hours per week the employee works hours days instead of hour days job sharing having qualified employees share the duties and tasks of one position both could work days or alternative between days one week and the next the advantage of job sharing is having people who both know the role the downside can be having a communication gap between individuals doing the role consider having an employee who is contemplating retirement job share with a more junior employee with high potential transition knowledge skills and commitment telecommuting this is the practice of allowing an employee work from their home location instead of on your premises there are guidelines governing the considerations for this type of employment in the past ten years the number of people telecommuting has tripled with results indicating that increased productivity and effectiveness were seen from this type of working arrangement regular part time work many people today are looking for meaningful work but on a part time basis a desire to balance work and life priorities has increased exponentially over the past decade and employers who recognize the contribution part time employees can make are leading their organizations forward

standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf january standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf january standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf january undg working group on programming issues preamble general assembly resolution a res on the triennial comprehensive policy review tcpr underscored that the resident coordinator supported by the united nations country team unct should report to national authorities on progress made against results agreed in the united nations development assistance framework undaf this request was reiterated in economic and social council ecosoc resolution which specifically requested that the secretary general through the united nations development group and its member agencies develop a standard operational format on reporting for this purpose bearing in mind the need to reduce the administrative burden and transaction costs the standard operational format and guidance for developing the undaf progress report are a direct response to these requests they are a product of an extensive consultative process with un staff at both headquarters and country levels in addition undg sees the standard operational format for reporting progress on the undaf as part of un reform efforts towards greater system wide coherence simplification and harmonization it also represents the un s response to the wider aid effectiveness agenda by supporting greater mutual accountability between the un and national authorities at country level the ecosoc resolution included an explicit statement on the need to reduce the administrative burden and transaction costs as with other un reform coordination initiatives there will be time and other costs incurred when developing the undaf progress report however to minimize these costs this guidance is based to the extent possible on material drawn from information and reports from existing systems and processes that country teams have in place the extent to which the administrative burden and transaction costs can be further reduced will be contingent upon introduction of parallel initiatives on for example common business practices and expenditure reporting which are being addressed under other undg processes these initiatives once implemented will help to provide clarity and reduce the burden to country teams of producing the undaf progress report in this document reference to national authorities includes technical ministries and development agencies corresponding to the mandates of un agencies and bodies the reporting also envisages social partners in the case of outcomes related to labour and employment social partners includes workers and employers organizations standard

contribution in rwanda annex examples of good practice for the undaf progress report annex annexes to the undaf progress report examples and guidance annex roles and responsibilities in the production of the undaf progress report standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf introduction the purpose of this guidance note is to help country teams to implement general assembly resolution a res on the tcpr effectively it does this by providing country teams with a standard operational format for producing an undaf progress report this guidance was developed following extensive review and consultations with un staff in field offices and at headquarters it also provides examples of good practice in the annual review process that were collected to serve as inputs to support this exercise by the undg consultations during the development of this guidance highlighted the importance of making it relevant and responsive to field needs and the commitment from the country teams if the process is to be successful the guidance is therefore designed to be short concise and easy to use by country teams this guidance also responds to the need to offer flexibility to country teams in developing a coherent approach that is a responsive to country needs b fits with the context within which country teams operate and c the level of capacity existing within country teams to support those who will lead the development of the reporting approach and unct management hyperlinks to examples from existing results reports and other relevant un guidance are provided in the annexes the guidance on the undaf progress report is consistent with the undaf guidelines for country teams entitled how to prepare an undaf part i guidelines for un country teams and part ii technical guidance for un country teams according to the undaf guidelines the unct and the government must conduct an annual review of the undaf while it is essential that the annual review process is documented an annual progress report is not mandatory however as a minimum a single undaf progress report must be produced per undaf cycle the following is a summary of the contents of the different parts of the guidance part elaborates key principles that the unct should consider part identifies the purpose of the undaf progress report part presents the standard operating format structure that uncts should use to develop the undaf progress report part outlines the annual review process to develop the analysis and narrative for the sections of the undaf progress report and additional material and good practice examples are annexed unct refers to representatives of the un funds programmes and specialized agencies and other un entities accredited to a given country it could also include representatives of the bretton woods institutions a undaf annual review process and annual review reporting good practice study report produced for the undg september and b mapping exercise and analysis of agency annual report requirements june standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf principles a the tcpr requests that the resident coordinator supported by the united nations country team should report to national authorities on progress made against results agreed in the united nations development assistance framework this request was reiterated in paragraph of the ecosoc resolution which further requested that the secretary general through the united nations development group and its member agencies develop a standard operational format for reporting for this purpose bearing in mind the need to reduce administrative burden and transaction costs the undg interprets the above to mean that country teams must produce a report to national authorities on progress towards the undaf results at least once during the undaf cycle however the option remains open for the unct to decide in consultation with government and other key partners to produce more than a single undaf progress report per undaf cycle if this will add value b the undaf progress report should focus on reporting the un s contribution to results at the undaf outcome level results should be reported at the undaf outcome level with discussion of the evidence of the un s contribution towards these results outcomes describe the intended changes in development conditions and normally relate to changes in institutional performance or behaviour among individuals or groups which partially result from unct cooperation the report should not discuss un supported activities it should only report on outputs in terms of how their achievement has contributed to the outcomes defined in the undaf results framework c the undaf progress report is a tool to enhance mutual accountability with national authorities the report is intended to contribute to the un s response to the wider aid effectiveness agenda by supporting greater mutual accountability between the un and member states at country level d the unct and government are required to have clear agreement on how the undaf progress report is to be used and the frequency of reporting un agencies and their partners remain accountable for the performance of individual projects and programmes and the undaf progress report does not blur this existing line of accountability the unct and government agree on how the undaf progress report is to be used to reinforce mutual accountability for progress towards undaf outcomes and any other uses of the report as a minimum a single undaf progress report must be produced per undaf cycle with the timing to be agreed between the country team and national authorities the option remains open for the unct to decide in consultation with government and other key partners to produce more than a single undaf progress report per undaf cycle if this will add value delivering as one countries are currently required to report annually mutual accountability has become established as a consideration of development and aid effectiveness although questions remain on its actual implications for the purpose of the undaf progress report mutual accountability is interpreted to mean the respective accountability of parties working together towards shared outcomes this notion of respective accountability reflects the fact that accountability is not fungible and must in the final analysis be attached to a specific actor many stakeholders contribute to undaf outcomes and each is accountable for its contribution the undaf progress report will focus on unct contributions to these outcomes and as such will address the respective accountability at the outcome level of each unct the suggestion is that the undaf progress report would have the maximum impact if produced in the first quarter of the last year of the undaf cycle this will maximize the use of undaf evaluation work normally carried out in the penultimate year first the context analysis can draw upon the common country analysis work carried out in the penultimate year second the annual review and undaf design processes in the penultimate year will both provide analysis of the relevance of the un s support and contribution and agreement with the government on lessons learned and the way forward finally the undaf evaluation would enhance the credibility of results reported as it would provide an impartial assessment of the evidence of the un s contribution and much of the narrative needed in the undaf progress report on the un s contribution by outcome standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf e reporting is an integral part of a comprehensive and strategic undaf planning and programming cycle which supports informed evidence based decision making the credibility of the results reported will depend on how well the undaf planning and annual review systems operate the annual review process should inform and provide inputs for the undaf progress report ideally an undaf process reflects strong links to national priorities and national ownership of the undaf an approach based on the current undaf guidelines or country specific modifications un staff ownership of the undaf and strong support for the annual review process and undaf progress reporting by the unct involvement of both national authorities and unct members including specialized and non resident agencies simplified procedures and reduced transaction costs for partners including government a scale of effort appropriate for the country programme a strong results based management rbm approach examining results areas and indicators against the work that has been done the outputs and outcomes and utilizing a credible monitoring and evaluation m e plan and modification of the undaf based on periodic reviews and evaluations and undaf programming principles particularly the principle of human rights based approach as established by the un and specialized agencies f strong engagement and ownership by national partners and the unct are critical strong engagement ownership and leadership are required from both national authorities and the unct in order to develop an undaf progress report unity of purpose and commitment within the unct as well as the participation of national partners are vital g uncts have the flexibility to decide what and how much information is presented in the undaf progress report the undaf progress report should be short and focused on reporting results at a strategic level in order to minimize transaction costs and enhance clarity and value the standard operational format is applicable to most country situations since the areas of focus are generic the amount of narrative and evidence presented is decided by the unct in consultation with the national authorities and would reflect the performance information available this will depend on the stage of the undaf cycle and the amount of analysis available from either the unct i e undaf end of cycle or other evaluations or the national authorities and other stakeholders h maximize use of data from existing reporting systems wherever possible to assess progress towards outcomes the unct will rely on data from national systems where available uncts determine how far outputs have been achieved and how far they are likely to contribute to the outcomes in doing so uncts also maximize the use of performance data from project programme performance assessments the rc annual report and any process for reviewing un reform universal rights are part of each member state s commitments under the un charter the constitutions of the specialized agencies and related declarations and conventions each stage of the programming cycle should ensure that adherence to such principles and rights is promoted by the unct reporting should include measurement of progress on principles and rights the format is also applicable in post conflict situations where the un has developed a transition plan however uncts should have flexibility to decide how to report on the un s humanitarian response where relevant standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf purpose of the undaf progress report the undaf progress report serves as a tool to show progress towards achieving national development priorities supported by the undaf and thereby enhances mutual accountability the unct consults with national authorities to ensure that they share common expectations on how the undaf progress report will be used where the added value in enhancing mutual accountability will be gained and when in the undaf cycle the report s will be produced in fostering mutual accountability the unct government and other key partners share key results to which they contribute in this context it is important to remember that it is during the annual review process that the unct primarily engages with government and other partners based on the use of robust performance information to increase informed decision making and identify detailed commitments for the coming year the undaf progress report will be accessible to a range of stakeholders both within the national authorities and more widely the added value of the undaf progress report may therefore come through increased transparency as it will become the single point of reference on what has been achieved at the undaf outcome level and the un s contribution since countries face different circumstances the unct in consultation with the national authorities can identify whether the report might meet additional needs suggestions of additional purposes that might be considered include a increasing information sharing b increasing ownership of shared outcomes between the national authorities other stakeholders and the united nations c strengthening the strategic management cycle for the undaf by linking assessments of performance lessons learned and decisions on how the overall programme might be adjusted d documenting agreed revisions of the undaf results framework and consequently changes adaptations for which the un may be held accountable and e reporting on implementation of key un reform at country level and how the reform enhances un coherence and effectiveness standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf this section provides an outline of the standard operational format for the undaf progress report the format includes the following five sections and required annexes i introduction length pages what should be covered state the purpose agreed with the government for the undaf progress report and summarize the process for developing the report briefly describe how relevant national strategies the poverty reduction strategy paper prsp and sector wide approaches swaps if relevant link to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals including the millennium development goals mdgs briefly describe the undaf its time span goals and links between undaf outcomes and achievement of the internationally agreed development goals including the mdgs state the period covered by the undaf progress report and describe any revisions of the undaf that occurred during the reporting period identify the un agencies for which results are included and any changes in agency roles that have affected undaf reporting and cross reference to annex which should include definitions of key terms to assist non un stakeholders unfamiliar with them ii key development trends length pages what should be covered key changes during the reporting period that have affected the development context in which the undaf has been implemented and external trends that affected the risks and assumptions made on what needed to be in place for the un s support to be effective i e political changes and emerging priorities that significantly changed policy focus disasters either humanitarian or natural significant shifts in international prices etc iii progress towards the undaf outcomes and the un s contribution length suggested pages per undaf outcome what should be covered under each separate undaf outcome a summary of progress in achieving the outcome against the established baselines and targets for each outcome this information should be normally drawn from information found in the government s reporting and data collection systems a narrative report assessing the un s contribution to achieving progress against the undaf outcomes based on the annual reviews and where possible end of cycle reviews by an inter agency group responsible for m e or equivalent the narrative report should focus on a i describing the strategic contribution of concerned un agencies and ii whether there is evidence that the contribution has been greater thanks to better coherence between the agency outputs there is no need to report on activities under projects and programmes and un outputs should only be identified in terms of how their achievement has contributed to a significant change at undaf outcome level it should also focus on standard operational format for the undaf progress report the minimum number of annexes that should be appended to the undaf progress report is given in annex vi standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf tcpr guidance on the contribution of un operational activities to national capacity development and development effectiveness including contributions to i capacity building ii south south cooperation and development of national capacities iii gender equality and women s empowerment and iv transition from relief to development as appropriate to each country context b outcome level quantitative indicators rarely track performance under each of the un s five inter related programming principles namely human rights gender equality environmental sustainability results based management and capacity development the narrative report on the un s contribution however must include an assessment of the degree to which these five principles have been reflected in the un s overall contribution and towards making progress against undaf outcomes or other cross cutting issues relevant to the country c identifying advocacy successes of the united nations that have led to the government increasing its commitment or prioritizing achievement of internationally agreed normative standards relevant to the undaf outcome d presenting evidence showing that the un s planned support remains relevant to the country context and national priorities e describing progress on the implementation or realization of principles rights or other normative standards iv progress on un reform length pages maximum what should be included a narrative identifying what the unct planned in this area for the reporting period and the degree to which these intentions have been met a review of any improved functioning of the un development system in line with tcpr guidance in terms of a coherence effectiveness and relevance and b country level capacity of the un development system assessment of progress against agreed benchmarks and results where agreed v lessons learned and way forward length pages maximum what should be covered remember that this section addresses issues at the unct level and therefore should not focus on what is happening within agency specific projects and programmes where accountability remains with the individual un agencies and their partners building on the deliberations during the annual review process the narrative should cover the following issues a changes in major planning assumptions risks and emerging opportunities b continued relevance of undaf outcomes and outputs to national priorities and broader country context c corresponding adjustments to expected results country programme outputs d revisions to strategies planned activities partnerships and resource allocations and identification of those responsible for these changes and e any agreed changes in the undaf results matrix standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf vi annexes to the report annex description of the annual review process what should be covered describe the annual review processes undertaken and how they fed in to the progress report explain the annual review and coordination mechanisms that have been put in place by the un and the government and the efficacy of their use compared with what is proposed in un guidance on the annual review process and assess the degree to which the process has been inclusive including both non resident and specialized agencies and how the unct might strengthen this aspect in the future annex definitions what should be covered provide key definitions particularly for non un stakeholders and a listing of acronyms used annex indicative and provisional programme expenditures what should be covered report on provisional expenditure across the whole un at country level identify continued funding gaps against the indicative budget framework found in the undaf and discuss transaction costs and efficiency where appropriate as per tcpr reporting requirements standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf figure illustrates how the information needed to complete the various sections of the undaf progress report can be developed as part of the annual review process particularly the sections outlined above on reporting progress against undaf outcomes the un s contribution and progress on un reform according to the undaf guidelines the undaf annual review process is to be aligned with the review of the national development plan to the extent possible the agency specific annual review processes would contribute to the undaf annual review the annual review process is where the unct primarily engages with government and other partners to review overall progress towards results and takes stock of lessons and good practices that feed into the annual planning processes and commitments for the coming year in order to facilitate the undaf annual review process the unct engages with national review mechanisms where such mechanisms exist for monitoring the national development priorities and or forms interagency groups around each national development priority reflected in the undaf as shown in figure a unct may follow a three step process for conducting an undaf annual review in step agency specific annual consultations take place on their individual programmes projects to review and agree on progress made including on the related undaf outputs the results of these consultations will feed into step in step inter agency groups responsible for m e track the un s contribution towards undaf outcome level results the m e groups prepare assessment reports by undaf outcome area describing the progress made towards the undaf outcome and key un s contributions as per section iii of the format this leads to step where a high level consultation with the government and other partners takes place to review overall progress this is a once a year opportunity for all agencies and national partners to interact and review the collective contribution of the un to national priorities based on the undaf at this meeting key lessons learned and the way forward is agreed and document as per section v of the format the consultative process at all levels of the undaf results chain should provide agencies and their national counterparts with an opportunity to assess and make recommendations related to the planning assumptions risks and emerging opportunities continued relevance of the undaf results to national priorities and any revisions to the planned undaf results at various levels including the related strategies partnerships and resource allocations any adjustments to the undaf outcomes and outputs will need to be made to the corresponding inter agency and agency documents to maintain consistency and alignment in a given year when the undaf progress report is being developed the annual reviews of the current and previous years as appropriate would help to generate different sections of the progress report particularly sections iii and v the recent good practice study on undaf annual review process and annual review reporting and consultation during the development of this guidance identified a number of examples and approaches that uncts could consider in strengthening their annual review process based on field requests these are summarized in annex and include hyperlinks to relevant country level examples an example of contribution analysis is presented in annex more examples will continue to be compiled and made available to country teams using the annual review process to develop the undaf progress report standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf figure using the annual review process to produce the relevant analysis for various sections of the undaf progress report step annual review of undaf outputs review and assess progress undaf output as part of agency

undaf progress report an example of what an inter agency group responsible for m e might report in terms of the un s contribution is shown below based on the experience of the un in rwanda and shows that contribution does not necessarily require large amounts of data as illustrated below the following points should be noted the government s overall goal is to build a knowledge based economy in rwanda following good practice the undaf outcome to which the un is contributing is shared between the un and government and other partners the government would provide the data on primary school completion rates the undaf output which in this example is shared by four un agencies describes what the un s contribution would be to achieving the related undaf outcome and the four un agencies contributing to this undaf output have also developed agency specific outputs which would be reviewed as part of the regular projects programmes m e processes the contribution analysis would then provide narrative evidence against the following questions have the four un agencies delivered their specific outputs and on schedule note that each agency is accountable for its output and the un programme officers should know the performance at this level if all four un agencies delivered their outputs on time were these successfully integrated into a single model note this is where you would look for synergy and coherence between the outputs of the four involved agencies and the added value of a common country programming approach if the un delivered its undaf output what evidence is there that the model will be implemented in this case the main evidence would be that the model was accepted by the government and funding for its rollout nationwide was put in place again if it is clear what others are expected to do this should not require collecting new data to answer if over the next to years the government reports a positive shift in the school completion rates what evidence is there that this is partly due to the un s contribution the model in this case the government piloted the model and evaluated its affects on primary school completion rates and found that there was strong evidence that the model for education proposed would have the intended effects upon completion rates annex an example of assessing the un s contribution standard operational format

provisional programme expenditures reporting provisional expenditure across the un system at country level remains a challenge except for multi donor trust funds mdtfs including one funds administered by the mdtf office and joint programmes current financial reporting systems are not designed to allow easy compilation of such data an automated web based reporting system established by the undp mdtf office utilizes unex and expense categories agreed to by the undg in prior to the development of an automated un system wide tool to facilitate the development of integrated reports other undg work streams have to ensure a consistent linking of programme expenditure in financial reporting systems to undaf outcomes by all relevant un agencies and b application of harmonized practices for cost classification across all un agencies the latter is soon to be reviewed by the undg and reissued on the basis of the agreement until the above has been implemented it is recommended that this part of the report focus on considering adopting the approach to reporting programme expenditure reflected in the examples provided in annex for those agencies that do not currently have a system that links expenditures in their work plan or the equivalent to the undaf outcomes a simple way of making such a link is shown in figure below experience suggests that while this takes considerable effort initially it does reduce the subsequent burden on uncts allowing them to focus on substantive analysis for the report introducing such a system should facilitate the preparation of reports against undafs on the basis of the common budgetary framework country development plans agency plans and individual project plans in response to requests from stakeholders including agency headquarters the

compensation benefits employee benefits employee benefits are optional non wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their normal wages or salaries these types of benefits may include group insurance health dental vision life etc disability income protection retirement benefits daycare tuition reimbursement sick leave vacation paid and non paid funding of education as well as flexible and alternative work arrangements in this section the benefits of benefits plan the basics health dental life ad d long term disability employee assistance plans eaps retirement benefits indirect non financial compensation the benefits of benefits plans although expensive there are many intrinsic benefits to providing your employees with a comprehensive benefit plan for most it is the ability to find and keep highly qualified staff that is the key driver with the sector being highly competitive and the number of new employees entering the workforce dwindling employers are challenged to become even more creative and responsive in the design timing and generosity of their benefit plans the more progressive the organization the more flexible the structure is in response to today s challenges i e like having four different generations of employees working side by side employers who continue to provide the more traditional and limited program may find it more difficult to find and keep different types of employees here are just a few of the advantages of offering benefits to your employees for employers by providing increased access and flexibility in employee benefits employers can not only recruit but retain qualified employees providing benefits to employees is seen as managing high risk coverage at low costs and easing the company s financial burden employee benefits have been proven to improve productivity because employees are more effective with they are assured of security for themselves and their families premiums are tax deductible as corporation expense which means savings for the organization for employees employees can experience a peace of mind which leads to increased productivity and satisfaction by being assured that they are their families are protected in any mishap employees with personal life and disability insurance can enjoy additional protection including income replacement in the event of serious illness or disability employees can feel a sense of pride in their employer if they are satisfied with the coverage they receive back to top the basics health dental health and dental benefits are considered the foundation of any benefit program design when considering the root issues of all absenteeism from the workplace most employers agree that health or dental related illness is cited most as the cause while many have not thought of dental coverage as being a key attraction point a number of medical reports have been published recently that indicate that many of our common virus and illnesses are actually related to poor dental health an organization s ability to be creative flexible and generous in providing health and dental coverage can be a key to attracting and retaining top performers as part of the total compensation package health even in canada where government plans provide approximately of all healthcare expenses the remaining gap is still perceived as a major concern for employees and employers private healthcare plans are restricted by legislation to expenses not fully covered by government programs organizational health expense plans are generally permitted in the following areas across canada hospital room charges in excess of the standard rate to cover semi private or private accommodation hospital charges for emergency treatment outside canada drugs medication and vaccines and other supplies available only by prescription professional services of a physician for out of country medical expenses professional services for private duty nursing charges for special medical appliances such as crutches artificial limbs or wheelchairs non emergency ambulance services dental treatments not requiring hospitalization professional services provided by licensed paramedicals such as psychologists massage therapists speech therapists podiatrists physiotherapists chiropractors osteopaths or naturopaths vision care expenses including frames and lenses contact lenses fitting and remedial treatment laser eye correction surgery this option is one that many employers struggle to provide their employees with as the number requiring vision care is so great the cost of including this option could raise the employer s costs by anywhere from to it is common practice to include many of the above items under a single extended healthcare plan most benefit carriers will tailor a plan to include only those features and coverage s desired certain items however are often restricted or sold in combination with other coverage s to contain overall plan costs or to subsidize heavily utilized services extended healthcare plan options should be selected based on the organization s overall compensation objectives and employee needs for small organizations the range of coverage options may be limited if the plans are financed on a fully insured basis these plans offer restricted flexibility to limit the occurrence of high risk claims these pre packaged plans are available to small organizations through affiliation with umbrella organizations such as chambers of commerce boards of trade trade associations and professional organizations for larger organizations the range of options is mostly limited by cost considerations dental dental plan design is the art of finding a delicate balance between understanding what the foundational priorities are and allocating sufficient funds to ensure that the coverage is perceived as being sufficient and appropriate although the type of dental work can differ from person to person some common elements have been found most employees their spouses and children require basic preventative dental care and repair therefore most employers elect to design the plan in such a way as to minimize the cost to employees of basic coverage since major restorative care and orthodontics tend to be more elective in nature and less common in need across the employee group than basic services most plans do not provide equal coverage in all areas for example the plan might pay of basic and of the other two categories it is also common to find deductibles co insurance and benefit maximums for the non basic services to free up more funds for the necessary preventive ones high employee deductibles and co insurance percentages can help to limit plan disbursements because employees will be paying more of the total costs the potential problem is that these high employee costs may in effect force postponement of needed dental work until the repair bill is even higher paying of basic preventative care from day one is the overwhelming choice of employers having the dental plan require a pre treatment evaluation for certain expenses helps control cost levels by ensuring that the plan only pays for reasonable treatments it also avoids any misunderstanding by the employee as to what services are covered and how much he or she is required to pay it is always preferable to ensure the employee knows what the plan will pay for and what exact dollar amount is their responsibility a commonly asked question of benefit administrators is why the dental plan is not optional but compulsory if the plan is optional only those employees who are likely to need dental care will sign up they will almost always use services that exceed their contributions deductibles and co insurance those who feel that the benefits will not cover their costs will decline because of this adverse selection cost per employee will be so high that employers would not be perceived as competitive back to top life and ad d most employers design their plans with a provision to protect the employee and or their family in the event of accidental death or dismemberment ad d employers often provide basic coverage as a factor of the employee s salary example the employee s salary in the event of death or total paralysis with additional coverage available should the employee chose to purchase it each employee benefit plan should include a chart that identifies what coverage is available and the associated cost back to top long term disability long term disability is an income replacement provision this is one provision that cannot be purchased through a spousal plan employees are asked to pay the total cost of the premiums in order to receive a tax free payment should they be unable to work long term disability coverage is applied for when an employee is unable to complete a certain percentage of the essential duties of their role due to illness on an ongoing basis the structure of each plan can differ slightly so understanding what you are trying to achieve with this program including elimination periods and termination options is critical at the outset employee assistance plans eaps an eap or employee assistance program is a confidential short term counseling service for employees with personal problems that affect their work performance studies have shown that providing confidential qualified counseling and support can reduce the stress and conflict felt by the employee which in turn can reduce absenteeism and ultimately turnover one on one sessions are offered and online information coaching and support services are also available employees turn to the eap for help with a variety of issues including the following dependent care issues such as searching for child care information identifying services for special needs children obtaining advice on the college application process or arranging for residential care for an elder dealing with the stress of a major life change even a positive one such as having or adopting a child getting married moving or buying a home or getting a promotion serious personal or professional concerns such as general anxiety depression substance abuse burnout coping with illness the loss of a loved one relationship challenges or resolving interpersonal conflicts different types of programs are available to employers to provide employee assistance employers can establish their own in house programs join a consortium of organizations to provide external services or refer employees to public and private providers of this service the range of costs across these options can vary widely organizations must then decide the most advantageous approach to achieve the level of improved wellness among their employees in selecting the best eap provider several factors need to be considered how accessible and convenient are the services to be provided location of offices and confidentially concerns are important here how is the quality of services to be measured how is client satisfaction to be assessed how are service costs to be determined and will there be limits placed on the frequency and extent of services provided what will the charges be per hour of service per individual before choosing an eap provider these questions need to be answered and the answers reflected in any service proposal or contract back to top retirement benefits a retirement plan or a pension is an arrangement by an employer to provide their employees with an income when they are no longer earning a regular income from working retirement plans may be set up by in a variety of ways but typically will have a form of a guaranteed payment often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money into a fund while employed so that they will receive benefits upon retirement pension plans are considered a form of delayed income pension plans pension plans are usually classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the payments are determined a defined benefit plan guarantees a predictable monthly payment at retirement calculated by using an established formula with some combination of the employee s salary years of service and or age a defined contribution plan will provide a payment payout at retirement that will be determined by the amount of money contributed during the life of the plan and the performance of the stock or investments used registered retirement savings plans a registered retirement savings plan or rrsp is an account that provides tax benefits for saving for retirement yet is not necessarily based on the employer employee relationship rrsps can provide ways to save money for retirement and defer and reduce taxes because contributions to rrsps up to established limits may be deducted from income in pre taxed dollars income earned within the account is not taxed until money is withdrawn from the plan rrsp accounts can be setup with as either individual rrsp an individual rrsp is associated with only a single individual only they contribute money to their rrsp spousal rrsp the spouse of the contributor is actually the account holder a spousal rrsp is a means of splitting income in retirement group rrsp an employer can arrange for employees to make contributions through a schedule of regular payroll deductions in many organizations rrsp contributions can be based on a matching program this means that the employer will put in a certain percentage or dollar amount based on the contributions the employee makes the employee gets to receive the tax savings immediately at the time of deduction instead of having to wait until the end of the tax year phased retirement today s work place is challenged with having up to four different generations working side by side for most employers designing a compensation and benefit structure that address the unique needs of each demographic group is a complex task added to that is the shift in pension structures over the past few years some non profit organizations provide their employees with a pension fund however most tend to offer only contributions to an rrsp this leads to an increasing number of employees not feeling able to retire it is important that organizations understand the details of their pension plan whether it is a defined benefit or contribution or simply an rrsp program before considering design changes for those not hindered by a design change one option that is gaining in popularity especially in this sector is providing a phased retirement program for older skilled employees for employees components of the phased program are allowing employees who might be considering retiring to delay their departure date continue to earn a partial income that reduces the burden on their pension income they continue to receive benefit coverage and are able to acclimate gradually by continuing to reduce their hours until they are prepared to leave for employers employers are able to develop a timely and effective succession plan without losing critical skills or intellectual capital organizations benefit by being able to tap into the most experienced staff at a reduced salary while transitioning to a new team or organizational design hurdles employees need to understand the impact continuing to work may have on pension or benefit programs also to be considered is the timing of starting your phased approach if an employee starts too soon they might not have accumulated enough to compensate for the reduced salary employers need to be sure that the phased retirement program is structured in a way that will not diminish the work of the organization or the financial position of the employee back to top indirect non financial compensation indirect compensation will look different in every organization ultimately it is the way in which you choose to define the culture of your organization and your total compensation rewards program that will differentiate it of course it is important to ensure it aligns with organizational strategic objectives recent studies all indicate that in today s changing work environment it is the flexibility and creativity that draws and keeps the highly skilled employee benefit perspective from a benefit perspective being creative and considering ways to improve the access or quality of your benefits could look like allowing employees to access their benefit as of their hire date being able to accumulate sick days to bridge to disability coverage being able to use some sick days as personal health days to allow employees to have a break without using all their holidays or pretending to be sick receiving your birthday off with pay eliminating the probationary period language from contracts offer letters seeking insurance providers with vision care benefits at reasonable costs allowing for some increased flexibility in personalizing benefit options i e health spending accounts vision care versus dental and more paramedical coverage although these options have a cost associated with them the cost is significantly less than the benefit an organization can reap in return if your insurance provider does not allow you the freedom to make some adjustments in your plan then it might be time to research what else is available other perspectives many articles have been written highlighting the keys to creating the best organization and to finding and keeping the best employees in recent studies the following were identified as key factors compensation paying employees fairly against both the market conditions as well as ensuring internal equity was still the number one factor considered providing clear information on the organization s compensation structure and consistent processes were critical to an employee s sense of commitment professional development for many people especially the younger generations the ability to develop both personally and professionally was highly valued and a key consideration deciding where to work access to training and development on the job and through courses or conferences were listed in a study done by the conference board of canada as important another variation of this was receiving reimbursement for courses taken on the employee s own time most commonly reimbursed were courses that aligned with a professional designation in the employees current role culture employees who were surveyed and asked what kept them in their current role indicated that having a culture that recognized the importance of connecting performance to rewards were key to their satisfaction performance management was one component that influenced the culture having clearly defined expectations being able to identify goals to work towards and having their evaluation align with those agreed to goals contributed to higher satisfaction levels receiving effective and realistic feedback both positive and constructive increased a continuous learning environment and increases commitment to the organization because performance both good and bad is recognized succession planning when operating within an organization brings a sense of purpose and sustainability to employees confidence in the future and their role it in was reported consistently by those who had been identified for a succession plan consider ways to develop younger staff with great potential by having them be identified as a potential successor to a long term employee the employee wins by learning new and critical skills while feeling rewarded for their hard work to date the more senior person feels rewarded for years of service and identified as a key contributor the organization wins by ensuring that intellectual capital is not lost but transitioned from one employee to another trust demonstrated as part of the culture of an organization is highly valued by all generations of employees in steven covey s book moving at the speed of trust leaders are challenged to evaluate if their organization s culture is one of trust or mistrust employees who feel trusted and respected will strive harder to maintain that trust and are less likely to do something that will result in a loss of trust workplace flexibility alternative work arrangements are effective ways to negotiate an arrangement that meet the needs of the organization while also providing employees will what they need to balance their home and work environments listed below are just some of the ideas that could be explored finding out what your organization would value can start this process the key is to ensure that any alternative arrangements considered do not hinder the organization s ability to ensure that core work is being completed in the time and manner required to maintain sustainability having clear expectations on both the organization and the employee s part as to the terms and conditions of the alternative work arrangement can prevent ineffective or damaging results flexible time this can be establishing core hours then allowing employees to work earlier in the day or later in the day example core hours are to person a starts at and works till person b works from to seasonal hours can be established in a variety of terms just as flexible hours schedule of part time employees example hiring a part time person to work days a week or a but they actually work full time for months a year and then take a combination of their time vacation and hours and take a month in the summer and a month in the winter off work they would continue to receive the salary for months a year compressed work week allowing an employee to work their full number of hours in less days example core hours are hours per week the employee works hours days instead of hour days job sharing having qualified employees share the duties and tasks of one position both could work days or alternative between days one week and the next the advantage of job sharing is having people who both know the role the downside can be having a communication gap between individuals doing the role consider having an employee who is contemplating

framework undaf this request was reiterated in economic and social council ecosoc resolution which specifically requested that the secretary general through the united nations development group and its member agencies develop a standard operational format on reporting for this purpose bearing in mind the need to reduce the administrative burden and transaction costs the standard operational format and guidance for developing the undaf progress report are a direct response to these requests they are a product of an extensive consultative process with un staff at both headquarters and

resolution included an explicit statement on the need to reduce the administrative burden and transaction costs as with other un reform coordination initiatives there will be time and other costs incurred when developing the undaf progress report however to minimize these costs this guidance is based to the extent possible on material drawn from information and reports from existing systems and processes that country teams have in place the extent to which the administrative burden and transaction costs can be further reduced will be contingent upon introduction of parallel initiatives on for example common business practices and expenditure reporting which are being addressed under other undg processes these initiatives once implemented will help to provide clarity and reduce the burden to country teams of producing the undaf progress report in this document reference to national authorities includes technical ministries and development agencies corresponding to the mandates of un agencies and bodies the reporting also envisages social partners in the case of outcomes related to labour and employment social partners includes workers and employers organizations standard

contribution in rwanda annex examples of good practice for the undaf progress report annex annexes to the undaf progress report examples and guidance annex roles and responsibilities in the production of the undaf progress report standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf introduction the purpose of this guidance note is to help country teams to implement general assembly resolution a res on the tcpr effectively it does this by providing country teams with a standard operational format for producing an undaf progress report this guidance was developed following extensive review and consultations with un staff in field offices and at headquarters it also provides examples of good practice in the annual review process that were collected to serve as inputs to support this exercise by the undg consultations during the development of this guidance highlighted the importance of making it relevant and responsive to field needs and the commitment from the country teams if the process is to be successful the guidance is therefore designed to be short concise and easy to use by country teams this guidance also responds to the need to offer flexibility to country teams in developing a coherent approach that is a responsive to country needs b fits with the context within which country teams operate and c the level of capacity existing within country teams to support those who will lead the development of the reporting approach and unct management hyperlinks to examples from existing results reports and other relevant un guidance are provided in the annexes the guidance on the undaf progress report is consistent with the undaf guidelines for country teams entitled how to prepare an undaf part i guidelines for un country teams and part ii technical guidance for un country teams according to the undaf guidelines the unct and the government must conduct an annual review of the undaf while it is essential that the annual review process is documented an annual progress report is not mandatory however as a minimum a single undaf progress report must be produced per undaf cycle the following is a summary of the contents of the different parts of the guidance part elaborates key principles that the unct should consider part identifies the purpose of the undaf progress report part presents the standard operating format structure that uncts should use to develop the undaf progress report part outlines the annual review process to develop the analysis and narrative for the sections of the undaf progress report and additional material and good practice examples are annexed unct refers to representatives of the un funds programmes and specialized agencies and other un entities accredited to a given country it could also include representatives of the bretton woods institutions a undaf annual review process and annual review reporting good practice study report produced for the undg september and b mapping exercise and analysis of agency annual report requirements june standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf principles a the tcpr requests that the resident coordinator supported by the united nations country team should report to national authorities on progress made against results agreed in the united nations development assistance framework this request was reiterated in paragraph of the ecosoc resolution which further requested that the secretary general through the united nations development group and its member agencies develop a standard operational format for reporting for this purpose bearing in mind the need to reduce administrative burden and transaction costs the undg interprets the above to mean that country teams must produce a report to national authorities on progress towards the undaf results at least once during the undaf cycle however the option remains open for the unct to decide in consultation with government and other key partners to produce more than a single undaf progress report per undaf cycle if this will add value b the undaf progress report should focus on reporting the un s contribution to results at the undaf outcome level results should be reported at the undaf outcome level with discussion of the evidence of the un s contribution towards these results outcomes describe the intended changes in development conditions and normally relate to changes in institutional performance or behaviour among individuals or groups which partially result from unct cooperation the report should not discuss un supported activities it should only report on outputs in terms of how their achievement has contributed to the outcomes defined in the undaf results framework c the undaf progress report is a tool to enhance mutual accountability with national authorities the report is intended to contribute to the un s response to the wider aid effectiveness agenda by supporting greater mutual accountability between the un and member states at country level d the unct and government are required to have clear agreement on how the undaf progress report is to be used and the frequency of reporting un agencies and their partners remain accountable for the performance of individual projects and programmes and the undaf progress report does not blur this existing line of accountability the unct and government agree on how the undaf progress report is to be used to reinforce mutual accountability for progress towards undaf outcomes and any other uses of the report as a minimum a single undaf progress report must be produced per undaf cycle with the timing to be agreed between the country team and national authorities the option remains open for the unct to decide in consultation with government and other key partners to produce more than a single undaf progress report per undaf cycle if this will add value delivering as one countries are currently required to report annually mutual accountability has become established as a consideration of development and aid effectiveness although questions remain on its actual implications for the purpose of the undaf progress report mutual accountability is interpreted to mean the respective accountability of parties working together towards shared outcomes this notion of respective accountability reflects the fact that accountability is not fungible and must in the final analysis be attached to a specific actor many stakeholders contribute to undaf outcomes and each is accountable for its contribution the undaf progress report will focus on unct contributions to these outcomes and as such will address the respective accountability at the outcome level of each unct the suggestion is that the undaf progress report would have the maximum impact if produced in the first quarter of the last year of the undaf cycle this will maximize the use of undaf evaluation work normally carried out in the penultimate year first the context analysis can draw upon the common country analysis work carried out in the penultimate year second the annual review and undaf design processes in the penultimate year will both provide analysis of the relevance of the un s support and contribution and agreement with the government on lessons learned and the way forward finally the undaf evaluation would enhance the credibility of results reported as it would provide an impartial assessment of the evidence of the un s contribution and much of the narrative needed in the undaf progress report on the un s contribution by outcome standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf e reporting is an integral part of a comprehensive and strategic undaf planning and programming cycle which supports informed evidence based decision making the credibility of the results reported will depend on how well the undaf planning and annual review systems operate the annual review process should inform and provide inputs for the undaf progress report ideally an undaf process reflects strong links to national priorities and national ownership of the undaf an approach based on the current undaf guidelines or country specific modifications un staff ownership of the undaf and strong support for the annual review process and undaf progress reporting by the unct involvement of both national authorities and unct members including specialized and non resident agencies simplified procedures and reduced transaction costs for partners including government a scale of effort appropriate for the country programme a strong results based management rbm approach examining results areas and indicators against the work that has been done the outputs and outcomes and utilizing a credible monitoring and evaluation m e plan and modification of the undaf based on periodic reviews and evaluations and undaf programming principles particularly the principle of human rights based approach as established by the un and specialized agencies f strong engagement and ownership by national partners and the unct are critical strong engagement ownership and leadership are required from both national authorities and the unct in order to develop an undaf progress report unity of purpose and commitment within the unct as well as the participation of national partners are vital g uncts have the flexibility to decide what and how much information is presented in the undaf progress report the undaf progress report should be short and focused on reporting results at a strategic level in order to minimize transaction costs and enhance clarity and value the standard operational format is applicable to most country situations since the areas of focus are generic the amount of narrative and evidence presented is decided by the unct in consultation with the national authorities and would reflect the performance information available this will depend on the stage of the undaf cycle and the amount of analysis available from either the unct i e undaf end of cycle or other evaluations or the national authorities and other stakeholders h maximize use of data from existing reporting systems wherever possible to assess progress towards outcomes the unct will rely on data from national systems where available uncts determine how far outputs have been achieved and how far they are likely to contribute to the outcomes in doing so uncts also maximize the use of performance data from project programme performance assessments the rc annual report and any process for reviewing un reform universal rights are part of each member state s commitments under the un charter the constitutions of the specialized agencies and related declarations and conventions each stage of the programming cycle should ensure that adherence to such principles and rights is promoted by the unct reporting should include measurement of progress on principles and rights the format is also applicable in post conflict situations where the un has developed a transition plan however uncts should have flexibility to decide how to report on the un s humanitarian response where relevant standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf purpose of the undaf progress report the undaf progress report serves as a tool to show progress towards achieving national development priorities supported by the undaf and thereby enhances mutual accountability the unct consults with national authorities to ensure that they share common expectations on how the undaf progress report will be used where the added value in enhancing mutual accountability will be gained and when in the undaf cycle the report s will be produced in fostering mutual accountability the unct government and other key partners share key results to which they contribute in this context it is important to remember that it is during the annual review process that the unct primarily engages with government and other partners based on the use of robust performance information to increase informed decision making and identify detailed commitments for the coming year the undaf progress report will be accessible to a range of stakeholders both within the national authorities and more widely the added value of the undaf progress report may therefore come through increased transparency as it will become the single point of reference on what has been achieved at the undaf outcome level and the un s contribution since countries face different circumstances the unct in consultation with the national authorities can identify whether the report might meet additional needs suggestions of additional purposes that might be considered include a increasing information sharing b increasing ownership of shared outcomes between the national authorities other stakeholders and the united nations c strengthening the strategic management cycle for the undaf by linking assessments of performance lessons learned and decisions on how the overall programme might be adjusted d documenting agreed revisions of the undaf results framework and consequently changes adaptations for which the un may be held accountable and e reporting on implementation of key un reform at country level and how the reform enhances un coherence and effectiveness standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf this section provides an outline of the standard operational format for the undaf progress report the format includes the following five sections and required annexes i introduction length pages what should be covered state the purpose agreed with the government for the undaf progress report and summarize the process for developing the report briefly describe how relevant national strategies the poverty reduction strategy paper prsp and sector wide approaches swaps if relevant link to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals including the millennium development goals

undaf progress report and describe any revisions of the undaf that occurred during the reporting period identify the un agencies for which results are included and any changes in agency roles that have affected undaf reporting and cross reference to annex which should include definitions of key terms to assist non un stakeholders unfamiliar with them ii key development trends length pages what should be covered key changes during the reporting period that have affected the development context in which the undaf has been implemented and external trends that affected the risks and assumptions made on what needed to be in place for the un s support to be effective i e political changes and emerging priorities that significantly changed policy focus disasters either humanitarian or natural significant shifts in international prices etc iii progress towards the undaf outcomes and the un s contribution length suggested pages per undaf outcome what should be covered under each separate undaf outcome a summary of progress in achieving the outcome against the established baselines and targets for each outcome this information should be normally drawn from information found in the government s reporting and data collection systems a narrative report assessing the un s contribution to achieving progress against the undaf outcomes based on the annual reviews and where possible end of cycle reviews by an inter agency group responsible for m e or equivalent the narrative report should focus on a i describing the strategic contribution of concerned un agencies and ii whether there is evidence that the contribution has been greater thanks to better coherence between the agency outputs there is no need to report on activities under projects and programmes and un outputs should only be identified in terms of how their achievement has contributed to a significant change at undaf outcome level it should also focus on standard operational format for the undaf progress report the minimum number of annexes that should be appended to the undaf progress report is given in annex vi standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf tcpr guidance on the contribution of un operational activities to national capacity development and development effectiveness including contributions to i capacity building ii south south cooperation and development of national capacities iii gender equality and women s empowerment and iv transition from relief to development as appropriate to each country context b outcome level quantitative indicators rarely track performance under each of the un s five inter related programming principles namely human rights gender equality environmental sustainability results based management and capacity development the narrative report on the un s contribution however must include an assessment of the degree to which these five principles have been reflected in the un s overall contribution and towards making progress against undaf outcomes or other cross cutting issues relevant to the country c identifying advocacy successes of the united nations that have led to the government increasing its commitment or prioritizing achievement of internationally agreed normative standards relevant to the undaf outcome d presenting evidence showing that the un s planned support remains relevant to the country context and national priorities e describing progress on the implementation or realization of principles rights or other normative standards iv progress on un reform length pages maximum what should be included a narrative identifying what the unct planned in this area for the reporting period and the degree to which these intentions have been met a review of any improved functioning of the un development system in line with tcpr guidance in terms of a coherence effectiveness and relevance and b country level capacity of the un development system assessment of progress against agreed benchmarks and results where agreed v lessons learned and way forward length pages maximum what should be covered remember that this section addresses issues at the unct level and therefore should not focus on what is happening within agency specific projects and programmes where accountability remains with the individual un agencies and their partners building on the deliberations during the annual review process the narrative should cover the following issues a changes in major planning assumptions risks and emerging opportunities b continued relevance of undaf outcomes and outputs to national priorities and broader country context c corresponding adjustments to expected results country programme outputs d revisions to strategies planned activities partnerships and resource allocations and identification of those responsible for these changes and e any agreed changes in the undaf results matrix standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf vi annexes to the report annex description of the annual review process what should be covered describe the annual review processes undertaken and how they fed in to the progress report explain the annual review and coordination mechanisms that have been put in place by the un and the government and the efficacy of their use compared with what is proposed in un guidance on the annual review process and assess the degree to which the process has been inclusive including both non resident and specialized agencies and how the unct might strengthen this aspect in the future annex definitions what should be covered provide key definitions particularly for non un stakeholders and a listing of acronyms used annex indicative and provisional programme expenditures what should be covered report on provisional expenditure across the whole un at country level identify continued funding gaps against the indicative budget framework found in the undaf and discuss transaction costs and efficiency where appropriate as per tcpr reporting requirements standard operational format guidance for reporting progress on the undaf figure illustrates how the information needed to complete the various sections of the undaf progress report can be developed as part of the annual review process particularly the sections outlined above on reporting progress against undaf outcomes the un s contribution and progress on un reform according to the undaf guidelines the undaf annual review process is to be aligned with the review of the national development plan to the extent possible the agency specific annual review processes would contribute to the undaf annual review the annual review process is where the unct primarily engages with government and other partners to review overall progress towards results and takes stock of lessons and good practices that feed into the annual planning processes and commitments for the coming year in order to facilitate the undaf annual review process the unct engages with national review mechanisms where such mechanisms exist for monitoring the national development priorities and or forms interagency groups around each national development priority reflected in the undaf as shown in figure a unct may follow a three step process for conducting an undaf annual review in step agency specific annual consultations take place on their individual programmes projects to review and agree on progress made including on the related undaf outputs the results of these consultations will feed into step in step inter agency groups responsible for m e track the un s contribution towards undaf outcome level results the m e groups prepare assessment reports by undaf outcome area describing the progress made towards the undaf outcome and key un s contributions as per section iii of the format this leads to step where a high level consultation with the government and other partners takes place to review overall progress this is a once a year opportunity for all agencies and national partners to interact and review the collective contribution of the un to national priorities based on the undaf at this meeting key lessons learned and the way forward is agreed and document as per section v of the format the consultative process at all levels of the undaf results chain should provide agencies and their national counterparts with an opportunity to assess and make recommendations related to the planning assumptions risks and emerging opportunities continued relevance of the undaf results to national priorities and any revisions to the planned undaf results at various levels including the related strategies partnerships and resource allocations any adjustments to the undaf outcomes and outputs will need to be made to the corresponding inter agency and agency documents to maintain consistency and alignment in a given year when the undaf progress report is being developed the annual reviews of the current and previous years as appropriate would help to generate different sections of the progress report particularly sections iii and v the recent good practice study on undaf annual review process and annual review reporting and consultation during the development of this guidance identified a number of examples and approaches that uncts could consider in strengthening their annual review process based on field requests these are summarized in annex and include hyperlinks to relevant country level examples an example of contribution analysis is presented in annex more examples will continue to be compiled

undaf progress report an example of what an inter agency group responsible for m e might report in terms of the un s contribution is shown below based on the experience of the un in rwanda and shows that contribution does not necessarily require large amounts of data as illustrated below the following points should be noted the government s overall goal is to build a knowledge based economy in rwanda following good practice the undaf outcome to which the un is contributing is shared between the un and government and other partners the government would provide the data on primary school completion rates the undaf output which in this example is shared by four un agencies describes what the un s contribution would be to achieving the related undaf outcome and the four un agencies contributing to this undaf output have also developed agency specific outputs which would be reviewed as part of the regular projects programmes m e processes the contribution analysis would then provide narrative evidence against the following questions have the four un agencies delivered their specific outputs and on schedule note that each agency is accountable for its output and the un programme officers should know the performance at this level if all four un agencies delivered their outputs on time were these successfully integrated into a single model note this is where you would look for synergy and coherence between the outputs of the four involved agencies and the added value of a common country programming approach if the un delivered its undaf output what evidence is there that the model will be implemented in this case the main evidence would be that the model was accepted by the government and funding for its rollout nationwide was put in place again if it is clear what others are expected to do this should not require collecting new data to answer if over the next to years the government reports a positive shift in the school completion rates what evidence is there that this is partly due to the un s contribution the model in this case the government piloted the model and evaluated its affects on primary school completion rates and found that there was strong evidence that the model for education proposed would have the intended effects upon completion rates annex an example of assessing the un s contribution standard operational format

office utilizes unex and expense categories agreed to by the undg in prior to the development of an automated un system wide tool to facilitate the development of integrated reports other undg work streams have to ensure a consistent linking of programme expenditure in financial reporting systems to undaf outcomes by all relevant un agencies and b application of harmonized practices for cost classification across all un agencies the latter is soon to be reviewed by the undg and reissued on the basis of the agreement until the above has been implemented it is recommended that this part of the report focus on considering adopting the approach to reporting programme expenditure reflected in the examples provided in annex for those agencies that do not currently have a system that links expenditures in their work plan or the equivalent to the undaf outcomes a simple way of making such a link is shown in figure below experience suggests that while this takes considerable effort initially it does reduce the subsequent burden on uncts allowing them to focus on substantive analysis for the report introducing such a system should facilitate the preparation of reports against
