the european commission has concluded that ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to billion to apple this is illegal under eu state aid rules because it allowed apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses ireland must now recover the illegal aid commissioner margrethe vestager in charge of competition policy said member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies this is illegal under eu state aid rules the commission s investigation concluded that ireland granted illegal tax benefits to apple which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years in fact this selective treatment allowed apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of per cent on its european profits in down to per cent in following an in depth state aid investigation launched in june the european commission has concluded that two tax rulings issued by ireland to apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by apple in ireland since the rulings endorsed a way to establish the taxable profits for two irish incorporated companies of the apple group apple sales international and apple operations europe which did not correspond to economic reality almost all sales profits recorded by the two companies were internally attributed to a head office the commission s assessment showed that these head offices existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits these profits allocated to the head offices were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the irish tax law which are no longer in force as a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from in to in on the profits of apple sales international this selective tax treatment of apple in ireland is illegal under eu state aid rules because it gives apple a significant advantage over other businesses that are subject to the same national taxation rules the commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a ten year period preceding the commission s first request for information in ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in ireland from apple for the years to of up to billion plus interest in fact the tax treatment in ireland enabled apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of apple products in the entire eu single market this is due to apple s decision to record all sales in ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold this structure is however outside the remit of eu state aid control if other countries were to require apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules this would reduce the amount to be recovered by ireland apple s tax structure in europe apple sales international and apple operations europe are two irish incorporated companies that are fully owned by the apple group ultimately controlled by the us parent apple inc they hold the rights to use apple s intellectual property to sell and manufacture apple products outside north and south america under a so called cost sharing agreement with apple inc under this agreement apple sales international and apple operations europe make yearly payments to apple in the us to fund research and development efforts conducted on behalf of the irish companies in the us these payments amounted to about us billion in and significantly increased in these expenses mainly borne by apple sales international contributed to fund more than half of all research efforts by the apple group in the us to develop its intellectual property worldwide these expenses are deducted from the profits recorded by apple sales international and apple operations europe in ireland each year in line with applicable rules the taxable profits of apple sales international and apple operations europe in ireland are determined by a tax ruling granted by ireland in which in was replaced by a similar second tax ruling this tax ruling was terminated when apple sales international and apple operations europe changed their structures in apple sales internationalapple sales international is responsible for buying apple products from equipment manufacturers around the world and selling these products in europe as well as in the middle east africa and india apple set up their sales operations in europe in such a way that customers were contractually buying products from apple sales international in ireland rather than from the shops that physically sold the products to customers in this way apple recorded all sales and the profits stemming from these sales directly in ireland the two tax rulings issued by ireland concerned the internal allocation of these profits within apple sales international rather than the wider set up of apple s sales operations in europe specifically they endorsed a split of the profits for tax purposes in ireland under the agreed method most profits were internally allocated away from ireland to a head office within apple sales international this head office was not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings only a fraction of the profits of apple sales international were allocated to its irish branch and subject to tax in ireland the remaining vast majority of profits were allocated to the head office where they remained untaxed therefore only a small percentage of apple sales international s profits were taxed in ireland and the rest was taxed nowhere in for example according to figures released at us senate public hearings apple sales international recorded profits of us billion c a billion but under the terms of the tax ruling only around million were considered taxable in ireland leaving billion of profits untaxed as a result apple sales international paid less than million of corporate tax in ireland in an effective tax rate of about on its overall annual profits in subsequent years apple sales international s recorded profits continued to increase but the profits considered taxable in ireland under the terms of the tax ruling did not thus this effective tax rate decreased further to only in apple operations europeon the basis of the same two tax rulings from and apple operations europe benefitted from a similar tax arrangement over the same period of time the company was responsible for manufacturing certain lines of computers for the apple group the majority of the profits of this company were also allocated internally to its head office and not taxed anywhere commission assessmenttax rulings as such are perfectly legal they are comfort letters issued by tax authorities to give a company clarity on how its corporate tax will be calculated or on the use of special tax provisions the role of eu state aid control is to ensure member states do not give selected companies a better tax treatment than others via tax rulings or otherwise more specifically profits must be allocated between companies in a corporate group and between different parts of the same company in a way that reflects economic reality this means that the allocation should be in line with arrangements that take place under commercial conditions between independent businesses so called arm s length principle in particular the commission s state aid investigation concerned two consecutive tax rulings issued by ireland which endorsed a method to internally allocate profits within apple sales international and apple operations europe two irish incorporated companies it assessed whether this endorsed method to calculate the taxable profits of each company in ireland gave apple an undue advantage that is illegal under eu state aid rules the commission s investigation has shown that the tax rulings issued by ireland endorsed an artificial internal allocation of profits within apple sales international and apple operations europe which has no factual or economic justification as a result of the tax rulings most sales profits of apple sales international were allocated to its head office when this head office had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business or any other substantive business for that matter only the irish branch of apple sales international had the capacity to generate any income from trading i e from the distribution of apple products therefore the sales profits of apple sales international should have been recorded with the irish branch and taxed there the head office did not have any employees or own premises the only activities that can be associated with the head offices are limited decisions taken by its directors many of which were at the same time working full time as executives for apple inc on the distribution of dividends administrative arrangements and cash management these activities generated profits in terms of interest that based on the commission s assessment are the only profits which can be attributed to the head offices similarly only the irish branch of apple operations europe had the capacity to generate any income from trading i e from the production of certain lines of computers for the apple group therefore sales profits of apple operation europe should have been recorded with the irish branch and taxed there on this basis the commission concluded that the tax rulings issued by ireland endorsed an artificial allocation of apple sales international and apple operations europe s sales profits to their head offices where they were not taxed as a result the tax rulings enabled apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies which is illegal under eu state aid rules this decision does not call into question ireland s general tax system or its corporate tax rate

in this document refer to facebook inc a delaware corporation and where appropriate its wholly owned subsidiaries the term facebook may also refer to our products regardless of the manner in which they are accessed for references to accessing facebook on the web or via a website such terms refer to accessing facebook on personal computers for references to accessing facebook on mobile such term refers to accessing facebook via a mobile application or via a mobile optimized version of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet limitations of key metrics and other data the numbers for our key metrics which include our daily active users daus mobile daus monthly active users maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than of our worldwide maus in we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories user misclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or non human entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in for example we estimate user misclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while user provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varies by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the user s ip address and self disclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the user s actual location for example a mobile only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user s actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses the numbers of daus mobile daus maus mobile maus mobile only daus and mobile only maus discussed in this annual report on form k as well as arpu do not include users of instagram or whatsapp unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics included herein do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated part i item business overview our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected our top priority is to build

of u s federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve user privacy and data protection rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data

interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the european legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal

engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if users increasingly engage with other products or services we fail to introduce new products or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency prominence format size and quality of ads that we display users have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of

engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook for and advertising accounted for and respectively of our revenue in addition we have recently introduced advertising on instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have long term advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us we expect our ability to grow advertising revenue will continue to be dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us or the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including decreases in user engagement including time spent on our products our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our mobile products product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand the pricing of our ads or both our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users changes to third party policies that limit our ability to deliver or target advertising on mobile devices the availability accuracy and utility of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers or our ability to further improve such tools loss of advertising market share to our competitors including if prices for purchasing ads on facebook increase or if competitors offer lower priced or more integrated products adverse legal developments relating to advertising including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us content on our products developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry the degree to which users opt out of certain types of ad targeting the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they click on our ads changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced and the impact of macroeconomic conditions whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems any changes in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long term best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long term benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communication and the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products that replicate the full range of capabilities we provide for example google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and video sharing and micro blogging and companies that provide web and mobile based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent on mobile devices and online in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences and or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook products and services and we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with facebook in favor of increased engagement with these other products and services in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in user engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more far reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook may use information shared by our users through facebook in order to develop products or features that compete with us certain competitors including google could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines or web browsers by making acquisitions by limiting or denying our access to advertising measurement or delivery systems by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or by making it more difficult to communicate with our users as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products compared to our competitors products particularly with respect to mobile products the size and composition of our user base the engagement of our users with our products and competing products the timing and market acceptance of products including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors products our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users our ability to monetize our products the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors customer service and support efforts marketing and selling efforts including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments our ability to establish and maintain developers interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other products changes mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation including settlements and consent decrees some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us acquisitions or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitors our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees particularly software engineers designers and product managers our ability to cost effectively manage and grow our operations and our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected action by governments to restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example in july we acquired oculus vr inc oculus a company developing virtual reality technology we do not have prior experience with consumer hardware products or virtual reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market oculus products or technology and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technology in addition in october we acquired whatsapp inc whatsapp and we have also invested significant resources in growing messenger we have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short term financial results we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to deliver the most relevant content to our users which may adversely affect the distribution of content of marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their development and marketing efforts on facebook we also may introduce changes to existing products or introduce new stand alone products that direct users away from properties where we have a proven means of monetization for example we have taken action to redirect users who send messages from within the facebook application to our stand alone messenger application although we do not monetize the stand alone messenger application in any significant manner in addition we plan to continue focusing on growing the user base for whatsapp and potentially other stand alone applications that may have limited or no near term monetization and it is possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application we also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of mobile products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term these decisions may not produce the long term benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with marketers and developers and our business and results of operations could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third party mobile and web applications integrated with facebook we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy and other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brands we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users or by users acting under false or inauthentic identities by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security related purposes or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business our industry is prone to cyber attacks with third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future as a result of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users to lose confidence in our products or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance government surveillance or other factors in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the actions of our users or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year or other factors the frequency prominence size format and quality of ads shown to users the pricing of our ads and other products our ability to maintain or increase payments and other fees revenue the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on facebook the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors increases in marketing sales and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins costs related to acquisitions including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet our ability to obtain equipment and components for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost effective manner system failures or outages which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time breaches of security or privacy and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third party actions fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products share based compensation expense including acquisition related expense adverse litigation judgments settlements or other litigation related costs changes in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy and data protection or enforcement by government regulators including fines orders or consent decrees the overall tax rate for our business which may be affected by a number of factors including the financial results of our international subsidiaries and the timing size and integration of acquisitions we may make from time to time tax obligations that may arise from changes in laws or resolutions of tax examinations that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates changes in u s generally accepted accounting principles and changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve greater market penetration for example the growth rate of our revenue declined from from to to from to we expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount of content they consume and the data they share with us as we develop and implement new products and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations we expect to continue to invest in our global connectivity efforts which may not have a clear path to monetization we may also be subject to increased costs in order to obtain and attract third party content or to facilitate the distribution of our products in addition we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our oculus products any such investments may not be successful and any such increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability our business is subject to complex and evolving u s and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy and data protection rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations in addition foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states these u s federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process and or receive transnational data that is critical to our operations including data relating to users customers or partners outside the united states and those laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change for example in october the european court of justice invalidated the european commission s safe harbour decision as a legitimate basis on which facebook could rely for the transfer of data from the european union to the united states in addition the other bases on which facebook relies are likely to be subject to regulatory or judicial scrutiny if facebook is unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which it operates it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results proposed legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the european legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for non compliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services these existing and proposed laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries investigations or actions can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquires in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of consumer and data protection as we continue to grow and expand our operations for example several data protection authorities in europe have initiated actions seeking to assert jurisdiction over facebook inc and our subsidiaries and to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information and other data protection authorities may do the same orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a non profit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code and or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various non practicing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non practicing entities from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party s rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative non infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative non infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages and or seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per user harm is small or non existent in addition we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our ipo we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy and personal injury torts this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for third party actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial for example in we paid approximately billion in cash and issued million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our acquisition of whatsapp and we paid approximately million in cash and issued million shares of our class b common stock in connection with our acquisition of oculus we also issued a substantial number of rsus to help retain the employees of these companies there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions in the future we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our common stock we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example oculus and whatsapp are larger and more complex than companies we have historically acquired in particular oculus builds technology and products that are new to facebook and with which we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support prior to the acquisition we are making substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed if our goodwill or finite lived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we review our finite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finite lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite lived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted as our user base and engagement continue to grow and the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve such as increased engagement with video we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users it is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities our business could be adversely affected our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally and or by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors vulnerabilities or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in measurement or billing errors compromise our ability to protect the data of our users and or our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example social games on facebook rely on adobe flash which games are currently responsible for substantially all of our payments revenue in july certain vulnerabilities discovered in flash led to temporary interruption of support for flash by popular web browsers if similar interruptions occur in the future and disrupt our ability to provide social games to some or all of our users our ability to generate payments revenue would be harmed any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects discovered in the software on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads particularly advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than of our worldwide maus in we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories user misclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or non human entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in for example we estimate that such user misclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while user provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varied by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the user s ip address and self disclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the user s actual location for example a mobile only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user s actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to as of december from as of december and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our third party relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at will employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custom made for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high as we mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively we may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile and or web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers and we expect that our payments revenue will continue to decline in the future as usage of facebook on personal computers continues to decline we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers specifically applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games we have experienced and expect to see the continued decline in usage of facebook on personal computers for the foreseeable future which we expect will result in a continuing decline in payments revenue in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebook integrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of facebook on personal computers or otherwise if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook or if facebook integrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance could be adversely affected payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and are applying for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook is not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to third party vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including political social or economic instability risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance intellectual property and terrestrial infrastructure matters potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls foreign exchange controls and tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the united states or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulties in staffing managing and overseeing global operations and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations compliance with the u s foreign corrupt practices act the u k bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions and compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our oculus products for example the oculus products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our oculus products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our financial results could be adversely affected we rely on third parties to manufacture our oculus products we may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them we also require the suppliers and business partners of our oculus products to comply with law and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to our reputation in addition the securities and exchange commission s conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of the origin source and chain of custody of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured we may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule such as costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the minerals used in oculus products the adoption of conflict minerals related governance policies processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities we may face inventory risk with respect to our oculus products we may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our oculus products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to oculus products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products oculus may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new oculus product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition in august we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes as of december no amounts were outstanding under this facility if we draw down on this facility in the future our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase significantly which could have an adverse effect on our financial results we may require additional capital to support our business growth and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms if at all we may require additional capital to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances our ability to obtain additional capital if and when required will depend on our business plans investor demand our operating performance the condition of the capital markets and other factors if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equity linked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock and our existing stockholders may experience dilution if we are unable to obtain additional capital when required or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to regular review and audit by u s federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position and results of operations many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business for example in the united kingdom enacted the diverted profits tax and australia passed the tax integrity multinational anti avoidance law both of which could increase our tax obligations the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project and has issued in and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations in addition the current u s administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to u s tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer u s taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may at a price of per share our stock price has ranged from to through december in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results the financial projections we may provide to the public any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors additional shares of our class a common stock being sold into the market by us our existing stockholders or in connection with acquisitions including shares sold by our employees to cover tax liabilities in connection with rsu vesting events or the anticipation of such sales investor sentiment with respect to our competitors our business partners and our industry in general announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features technical innovations acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base the level of user engagement or the effectiveness of our ad products changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry including our developers and competitors price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole the inclusion or deletion of our class a common stock from any trading indices such as the s p index media coverage of our business and financial performance lawsuits threatened or filed against us developments in anticipated or new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions including interim or final rulings by tax judicial or regulatory bodies and other events or factors including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism or responses to these events in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of our class a common stock increases in addition our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the ten to one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock we have elected to take advantage of the controlled company exemption to the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies which could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have an independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock our status as a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than of the combined voting power of our common stock any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding class b common stock voting as a separate class we have a dual class common stock structure which provides mr zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two thirds of the combined vote of our then outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent only our chairman our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and certain litigation against us can only be brought in delaware item unresolved staff comments none item properties our corporate headquarters are located in menlo park california as of december we owned and leased approximately two million square feet for our corporate headquarters and acres of land to accommodate anticipated future growth in addition we leased office and data center facilities around the world totaling three million square feet we also own data centers in various locations throughout the united states and a data center facility in sweden during we entered into an agreement to lease an entire office building in london united kingdom that is currently under construction as a result of our involvement during the construction period we are considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction project as such we have excluded the square footage from the total leased space and owned properties disclosed above we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs item legal proceedings beginning on may multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors and or certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other trading related errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings in the u s district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in and the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers on july the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions on december the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec in addition we are also currently parties to multiple other lawsuits related to our products including intellectual property lawsuits as well as class action lawsuits

obligations long term debt total liabilities additional paid in capital total stockholders equity in november the fasb issued accounting standards update no income taxes topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified all of our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets data for all periods presented as a result of the reclassifications certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities as of december and were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets free cash flow in addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap we monitor free cash flow fcf as a non gaap measure to manage our business make planning decisions evaluate our performance and allocate resources we define fcf as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and property and equipment acquired under capital leases we believe that fcf is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business we have chosen to subtract both purchases of property and equipment and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in our calculation of fcf because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business regardless of whether we finance such property or equipment with a capital lease the market for financing servers and other technical equipment is dynamic and we expect our use of capital leases could vary significantly from year to year we have chosen our definition for fcf because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business we use fcf in discussions with our senior management and board of directors fcf has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other gaap financial measures such as net cash provided by operating activities some of the limitations of fcf are fcf does not reflect our future contractual commitments and other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the fcf measure through disclosure of such limitations presentation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap and reconciliation of fcf to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities as presented below the following is a reconciliation of fcf to the most comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities year ended december in millions net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment property and equipment acquired under capital leases free cash flow for the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by million of income tax refundable from income tax loss carrybacks due to the recognition of tax benefits related to share based compensation from restricted stock units granted prior to january we received substantially all of this refund in which increased our net cash provided by operating activities and fcf for the year ended december item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k particularly in part i item risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form k certain revenue information in the sections entitled executive overview of full year results and revenue foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a non gaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year using monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u s dollar this non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year over year comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this non gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business executive overview of full year results our key user metrics and financial results for are as follows user growth daily active users daus were billion on average for december an increase of year over year mobile daus were million on average for december an increase of year over year monthly active users maus were billion as of december an increase of year over year mobile maus were billion as of december an increase of year over year financial results revenue was billion up year over year or year over year on a constant currency basis and ad revenue was billion up year over year or year over year on a constant currency basis total costs and expenses were billion income from operations was billion net income was billion with diluted earnings per share of capital expenditures were billion effective tax rate was cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion as of december headcount was as of december in we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities i continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile ii growing the number of marketers using our ad products and iii making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers in addition we invested and will continue to invest across three priorities i our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses ii our next generation of services such as instagram messenger and whatsapp and iii our long term innovation efforts such as connectivity efforts virtual reality and artificial intelligence research we expect these investments will continue to drive significant overall year over year expense growth compared to trends in our user metrics the numbers for our key metrics our daily active users daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu and certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures daily active users daus we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we view daus and daus as a percentage of maus as measures of user engagement note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east worldwide daus increased to billion on average during december from million during december we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india the united states and brazil overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december compared to the same period in we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions mobile daus we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we define a mobile only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day worldwide mobile daus increased to million on average during december from million during december in all regions an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during december as compared to the same period during with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during december on average during december there were million mobileonly daus increasing from million mobile only daus during the same period in the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future monthly active users maus we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user in the last days as of the date of measurement maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community as of december we had billion maus an increase of from december users in india the united states and brazil represented key sources of growth in overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december compared to the same period in we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions mobile maus we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user during the period of measurement we define a mobile only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement worldwide mobile maus increased to billion as of december from billion as of december in all regions an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in as compared to the same period in with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in there were million mobile only maus as of december increasing from million mobile only maus during the same period in the remaining million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during december we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in in the united states canada region was more than seven times higher than in the asia pacific region note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue generating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer for worldwide arpu was an increase of from over this period arpu increased by in united states canada in europe in asia pacific and in rest of world the general strengthening of the u s dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from to had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our arpu outside the united states and canada region in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such as asia pacific and rest of world such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes share based compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k revenue recognition for payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers people can make payments on facebook by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the facebook website the price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties share based compensation we account for share based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all share based payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award share based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share based awards that we expect to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued post acquisition employment we have accounted for them as post acquisition share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management s expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired as of december no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets has been identified acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life components of results of operations revenue advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties including our mobile applications and third party affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by people the number of actions taken by people or the number of impressions delivered we recognize revenue from the delivery of click based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content and action based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impression based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression click or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor we recognize revenue on a net basis payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games our other fees revenue which has not been significant in recent periods consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of

total revenue compared to revenue in increased billion or compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices in we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately in factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in included i an increase in demand for our ad inventory in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook ii an increase in mobile user growth and engagement and iii an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed as well as the quality relevance and performance of those ads in compared to the average price per ad increased by and the number of ads delivered decreased by the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non news feed ads during the third quarter of which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of increased compared to the same period in the increase in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of was driven by the same factors that drove annual advertising revenue growth primarily an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices for the fourth quarter of we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately of total advertising revenue as compared with in the same period in advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased and between the third and fourth quarters of and respectively while advertising revenue for the first quarters of and declined and compared to the fourth quarters of and respectively payments and other fees revenue in decreased million or compared to the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was a result of decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers partially offset by an increase in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of decreased million or compared to the same period in payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on payments revenue from games played on personal computers as users shift their usage to mobile devices facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future resulting in a decline in our payments revenue compared to revenue in increased billion or compared to the increase was due primarily to a increase in advertising revenue during as compared to the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers news feed ads are displayed more prominently have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements in we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately of total advertising revenue as compared with in other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in included i an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on

impact on revenue the general strengthening of the u s dollar relative to certain foreign currencies primarily the euro from the fourth quarter of and full year to the same periods in had an unfavorable impact on our revenue if we had translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year using monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u s dollar our total revenue would have been billion and billion respectively and our advertising revenue would have been billion and billion respectively using these constant rates both revenue and advertising revenue would have been million and billion higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year respectively there were no material foreign exchange impacts on our

taxes in increased million or compared to primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate in remained flat compared to our effective tax rate differs from the u s statutory rate primarily because of the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business non deductible share based compensation operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u s and tax research credits our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing size and integration of any acquisitions we make on july the united states tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of share based compensation expense in an intercompany cost sharing arrangement this opinion concluded that related parties in a costsharing arrangement are not required to share share based compensation a final decision was issued by the tax court however this

our data center operations and to a lesser extent construction commitments related to our data center sites in addition our other liabilities include billion related to uncertain tax positions as of december due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table contingencies we are involved in claims lawsuits government investigations and other legal proceedings we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash

report on form k for additional information regarding these contingencies recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no revenue from contracts with customers topic asu which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition in august the fasb issued asu no revenue from contracts with customers topic deferral of the effective date which delays the effective date of asu by one year the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date as such the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of we are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in november the fasb issued accounting standards update no income taxes topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet the updated standard is effective for us beginning on january with early application permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets for all periods presented as a result of the reclassifications certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the u s dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the u s dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the u s dollar have negatively affected our revenue and other operating results as expressed in u s dollars we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of million million and million in and respectively interest rate sensitivity our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in u s interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of million and million in the market value of our available for sale debt securities as of december and december respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity item financial statements and supplementary data facebook inc index to

significant accounting policies organization and description of business facebook was incorporated in delaware in july our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising basis of presentation we prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of facebook inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated use of estimates conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources we base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition collectability of accounts receivable contingent liabilities fair value of financial instruments fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment and income taxes these estimates are based on management s knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future actual results could differ materially from those estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue once all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of our obligations to our customer has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured revenue for the years ended december and consists of the following in millions year ended december advertising payments and other fees total revenue advertising advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook properties including our mobile applications and third party affiliated websites or mobile applications the arrangements are evidenced by either online acceptance of terms and conditions or contracts that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered the timing and the pricing marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by our users the number of actions taken by our users or the number of impressions delivered the typical term of an advertising arrangement is less than one month with billing generally occurring after the delivery of the advertisement we recognize revenue from the delivery of click based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content and action based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impression based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit cards and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good from a developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of the transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer the price of the purchase is an amount that is solely determined by the developer our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the service performed we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person additionally we record all payments revenue at the time of the purchase of the related virtual goods net of estimated refunds or chargebacks other fees which includes our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices were not material in all periods presented in our financial statements revenue is recognized net of applicable sales and other taxes cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation energy and bandwidth costs and salaries benefits and share based compensation for employees on our operations teams cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions amortization of intangible assets costs associated with data partner arrangements and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold share based compensation we account for share based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of gaap those provisions require all share based payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight line basis in our consolidated statements of income over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award the majority of our awards are earned over a service period of four years share based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such only those share based awards that we expect to vest are recorded we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued post acquisition employment we have accounted for them as post acquisition share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award during the years ended december and we realized tax benefits from share based award activity of billion billion and million respectively these amounts reflect the extent that the total reduction to our income tax liability from share based award activity was greater than the amount of the deferred tax assets that we had previously recorded in anticipation of these benefits these amounts are the aggregate of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that we recorded reduced by any individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded these net amounts were recorded as an adjustment to stockholders equity in each period as an increase to cash flows from operating activities and were not recognized in our consolidated statements of income in addition we reported excess tax benefits that decreased our cash flows from operating activities and increased our cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december and by billion billion and million respectively the amounts of these excess tax benefits reflect the total of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that were recorded but were not reduced by any of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded income taxes we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities these differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse we recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties advertising expense advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income we incurred advertising expenses of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds with maturities of days or less from the date of purchase we hold investments in marketable securities consisting of u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations our available for sale investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses net of taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in stockholders equity unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income expense net when a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthan temporary we have not recorded any such impairment charge in the periods presented we determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other income expense net we classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions fair value of financial instruments we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs our valuation technique used to measure the fair value of our contingent consideration liability was based on the present value of probability weighted future cash flows related to the contingent earn out criteria and the fair value of our common stock on each reporting date accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts we make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of our customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay property and equipment property and equipment which includes amounts recorded under capital leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term in the case of a capital lease whichever is shorter the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below property and equipment useful life network equipment three to five years buildings three to years computer software office equipment and other three to five years leased equipment and leasehold improvements lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use the cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations lease obligations we lease office space data centers and equipment under non cancelable capital and operating leases with various expiration dates through certain of the operating lease agreements contain rent holidays rent escalation provisions and purchase options rent holidays and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the straight line rent expense to be recorded over the lease term the lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the leased property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease we do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease inception we record assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred by third parties under build to suit lease arrangements to the extent that we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or bear construction risk prior to commencement of a lease loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired as of december no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets has been identified acquired indefinite lived intangible assets related to our in process research and development ipr d are capitalized and subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects upon successful completion of each project we will make a separate determination of useful life of the acquired indefinite lived intangible assets and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life of the specific projects acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life deferred revenue and deposits deferred revenue consists of billings in advance of revenue recognition deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users once this balance is utilized by a user approximately of this amount would then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue deferred revenue and deposits consists of the following in millions december deferred revenue deposits total deferred revenue and deposits foreign currency generally the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to u s dollars using month end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for revenue costs and expenses translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a component of stockholders equity as of december and we had a cumulative translation loss net of tax of million and million respectively net losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions were million million and million for the years ended december and respectively these losses were recorded as interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income credit risk and concentration our financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents restricted cash marketable securities and accounts receivable cash equivalents consist of short term money market funds which are managed by reputable financial institutions marketable securities consist of investments in u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities our investment policy limits investment instruments to u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries we generated and of our revenue for the years ended december and respectively from marketers and developers based in the united states with the majority of revenue outside of the united states coming from customers located in western europe china brazil canada and australia we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses during the years ended december and our bad debt expenses were million million and million respectively in the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected no customer represented or more of total revenue during the years ended december and segments our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer who makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis there are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision maker or anyone else for operations operating results and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level accordingly we have determined that we have a single reportable segment and operating unit structure recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no revenue from contracts with customers topic asu which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition in august the fasb issued asu no revenue from contracts with customers topic deferral of the effective date which delays the effective date of asu by one year the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date as such the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of we are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in november the fasb issued accounting standards update no income taxes topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet the updated standard is effective for us beginning on january with early application permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified million of our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets as of december this resulted in net adjustments of million increase and million decrease to our noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liability respectively on our december consolidated balance sheet note acquisitions during the year ended december we completed several business acquisitions for total consideration of million primarily related to a business combination involving land and buildings adjacent to our headquarters in menlo park included in this amount is a million promissory note payable issued in connection with this particular acquisition this promissory note payable is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate accordingly pro forma historical results of operations related to these business acquisitions during the year ended december have not been presented we have included the financial results of these business acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition the following table summarizes the allocation of the total consideration transferred during the year ended december including the related estimated useful lives where applicable in millions useful lives in years finite lived intangible assets acquired technology other land acquired other net tangible assets acquired deferred tax assets net net assets acquired goodwill total fair value consideration goodwill generated from all business acquisitions completed during the year ended december is primarily attributable to expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities the amount of goodwill generated during this period that is deductible for tax purposes is not material note earnings per share we compute earnings per share eps of class a and class b common stock using the two class method required for participating securities we consider restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders basic eps is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of our class a and class b common stock outstanding adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase for the calculation of diluted eps net income attributable to common stockholders for basic eps is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities including awards under our equity compensation plans and inducement awards under separate non plan rsu award agreements in addition the computation of the diluted eps of class a common stock assumes the conversion of our class b common stock to class a common stock while the diluted eps of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to class a common stock diluted eps attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding basic and dilutive securities in our basic and diluted eps calculation for the year ended december and do not include contingent earn out shares issuance of these earn out shares is dependent upon the completion of certain milestones these milestones have not been met as of december and accordingly these shares have been excluded from the effect of basic and dilutive securities the rsus excluded from the eps calculation because the impact would be anti dilutive were not material for the years ended december and respectively basic and diluted eps are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted eps computations for our common stock are calculated as follows in millions except per share amounts year ended december class a class b class a class b class a class b basic eps numerator net income less net income attributable to participating securities net income attributable to common stockholders denominator weighted average shares outstanding less shares subject to repurchase number of shares used for basic eps computation basic eps diluted eps numerator net income attributable to common stockholders reallocation of net income attributable to participating securities reallocation

gross unrealized gains or losses on our marketable securities as of december and were not significant in addition the gross unrealized loss that had been in a continuous loss position for months or longer was not significant as of december there was no such loss as of december as of december we considered the decreases in market value on our marketable securities to be temporary in nature and did not consider any of our investments to be other than temporarily impaired the following table classifies our marketable securities by contractual maturities in millions december due in one year

and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value we classify our contingent consideration liability in connection with an acquisition in within level as factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity we estimate the fair value of our contingent consideration liability based on the present value of probability weighted future cash flows related to the contingent earn out criteria and the fair value of our common stock on each reporting date changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the acquisition date such as changes in the probability assessment and the fair value of our common stock are recognized in earnings in the period when the change in the estimated fair value occurs during the year ended december we recognized an increase in the fair value of our contingent liability of million in research and development expense in our

millions december income tax payable deferred tax liabilities contingent consideration liability other liabilities other liabilities in november the fasb issued asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet we early adopted this standard retrospectively and as a result of the reclassifications certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets see note in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information note long term debt in august we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus as well as an annual commitment fee of on the daily undrawn balance of the facility we paid origination fees at closing of the revolving credit facility which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august as of december no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this facility note commitments and contingencies commitments leases we entered into various capital lease arrangements to obtain property and equipment for our operations additionally on occasion we have purchased property and equipment for which we have subsequently obtained capital financing under

leased buildings leasehold improvements and equipment we have also entered into various non cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices equipment land and data centers with original lease periods expiring between and we are committed to pay a portion of the related actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements certain of these arrangements have free

respectively other contractual commitments we also have billion of non cancelable contractual commitments as of december primarily related to network infrastructure for our data center operations and to a lesser extent construction of our data center sites the majority of these commitments are due within five years contingencies legal matters beginning on may multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors and or certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other trading related errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings in the u s district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in and the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers on july the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions on december the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec we are also party to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business with respect to our outstanding legal matters we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management s expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected indemnifications in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of services and products we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers directors and certain employees and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in our opinion as of december there was not at least a reasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties we have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through december note stockholders equity follow on offering in december we completed a follow on offering in which we issued and sold million shares of class a common stock at a public offering price of per share and the selling stockholders sold million shares of class a common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders the total net proceeds received from the follow on offering were billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering expenses of approximately million common stock

directors subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends as of december we did not declare any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends the holder of each share of class a common stock is entitled to one vote while the holder of each share of class b common stock is entitled to ten votes shares of our class b common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock and generally convert into shares of our class a common stock upon transfer class a

addition shares available for grant under the stock plan which were reserved but not issued forfeited or repurchased at their original issue price or subject to outstanding awards under the stock plan as of the effective date of our ipo were added to the reserves of the plan and shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of rsus are also added to the reserves of the plan in january we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of rsus in order to cover any required withholding taxes rather than our previous approach of net share settlement the maximum term for stock options granted under the plan may not exceed ten years from the date of grant our plan will terminate ten years from the date of approval unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors or a committee thereof in connection with an acquisition in we granted inducement awards covering an aggregate of million rsus earned over a service period

change of greater than over a three year period our net foreign pretax income includes jurisdictions with both pretax earnings and pretax losses our consolidated financial statements provide taxes for all related tax liabilities that would arise upon repatriation of earnings in the foreign jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings outside the united states and the

income taxes on the consolidated statements of income the amount of interest and penalties accrued as of december and was not material if the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of billion as of december was realized in a future period this would result in a tax benefit of billion within our provision of income taxes at such time on july the united states tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of sharebased compensation expense in an intercompany cost sharing arrangement this opinion concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share share based compensation a final decision was issued by the tax court however this decision may be appealed by the commissioner the impact of the conclusions stated by the tax court in its opinion was not material to our consolidated financial statements we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions the material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the united states and ireland we are under examination by the internal revenue service irs for our through tax years we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations and we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next months related to these years our and future years remain open to examination by the irs our and future years remain open to examination in ireland although the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next months however

during no member of our board of directors attended fewer than of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the board of directors held during the period for which he or she was a director and

directors and performs such additional duties as the board of directors may otherwise determine and delegate generally each regular meeting of our board of directors includes a meeting of our independent directors without management present controlled company status because mr zuckerberg controls a majority of our outstanding voting power we are a controlled company under the corporate governance rules of the nasdaq stock market llc nasdaq therefore we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors has determined not to have an independent nominating function and to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board notwithstanding our status as a controlled company we intend to continue to have a compensation governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors director independence the rules of nasdaq generally require that a majority of the members of a listed company s board of directors be independent in addition the listing rules generally require that subject to specified exceptions each member of a listed company s audit compensation and governance committees be independent although we are a controlled company under the corporate governance rules of nasdaq and therefore are not required to comply with certain rules requiring director independence we have nevertheless opted under our corporate governance guidelines to have a majority of the members of our board of directors be independent and to have a compensation governance committee comprised solely of independent directors audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in rule under the securities exchange act of as amended exchange act in order to be considered independent for purposes of rule a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee the board of directors or any other board committee accept directly or indirectly any consulting advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries our board of directors has determined that none of our non employee directors has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the rules of nasdaq our board of directors has also determined that messrs andreessen and bowles board of directors and dr desmond hellmann who comprise our audit committee and messrs andreessen hastings and thiel who comprise our compensation governance committee satisfy the independence standards for those committees established by applicable sec rules nasdaq rules and applicable rules of the internal revenue code of as amended code classified board so long as the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent a majority of the combined voting power of common stock we will not have a classified board of directors and all directors will be elected for annual terms as of the close of business on april the outstanding shares of class b common stock represented a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock however our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock we will have a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size each serving staggered three year terms at such time our directors will be assigned by the then current board of directors to a class upon expiration of the term of a class of directors directors for that class will be elected for three year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which that term expires as a result only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three year terms each director s term continues until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death resignation or removal in addition when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and we have a classified board only our board of directors may fill vacancies on our board any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that as nearly as possible each class will consist of one third of the total number of directors the classification of our board of directors if implemented may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management

and connected we believe that facebook is still in the early stages of this journey and that for us to be successful we must hire and retain people who can continue to develop our strategy quickly innovate and build new products bolster the growth of our user base and user engagement and constantly enhance our business model to achieve these objectives we need a highly talented team comprised of engineering product sales and general and administrative professionals we also expect our executive team to possess and demonstrate strong leadership and management capabilities objectives our compensation programs for our named executive officers are built to support the following objectives attract the top talent in our leadership positions and motivate our executives to deliver the highest level of individual and team impact and results encourage our executives to model the important aspects of our culture which include moving fast being bold communicating openly focusing on impact and building social value in the world ensure each one of our named executive officers receives a total compensation package that encourages his or her longterm retention reward high levels of performance with commensurate levels of compensation and align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders in the overall success of facebook by emphasizing long term incentives design our executive compensation program continues to be heavily weighted towards equity in particular restricted stock units rsus with cash compensation that is generally below market relative to executive compensation at our peer companies we believe that equity compensation offers the best vehicle to focus our executive officers on our mission and the achievement of our long term strategic and financial objectives and to align our executive officers with the long term interests of our stockholders we typically grant our executive officers an annual equity award with service based vesting conditions where the commencement of vesting is deferred until a date some years in the future as discussed further in elements of executive compensation equity compensation below when combined with the executives prior equity awards we believe that these additional grants represent a strong long term retention tool and provide the executive officers with long term equity incentives we evaluate our executive compensation programs including our mix of cash and equity compensation on an annual basis or as circumstances require based on our business objectives and the competitive environment for talent for the near future we anticipate continuing our emphasis on pay for performance and long term incentive compensation for our executive officers while increasing cash compensation in order to move closer to market relative to our peer companies compensation setting process role of our compensation governance committee the compensation governance committee is

companies set forth below with whom we compete for hiring and retaining executive talent our peer group the compensation governance committee also considered the scope of responsibility of each executive officer our current practice of maintaining minimal differentiation between the cash packages of our executive officers the unvested balances of equity awards for each executive officer as well as the compensation governance committee s assessment of each executive officer s performance and impact on the organization in determining compensation we did not use a formula for taking into account these different factors we analyze market data for executive compensation at least annually using the most relevant published survey sources public filings and input from compensia management and compensia provided the compensation governance committee with both cash and equity compensation data for our peer group which was selected from companies that meet some or all of the criteria listed below high technology or media company key talent competitor minimum revenue of billion and or minimum market capitalization of billion using this criteria as a baseline the compensation governance committee approved the following companies for inclusion in our compensation peer group for adobe microsoft alphabet netflix amazon com qualcomm apple salesforce com cisco systems sap ebay the walt disney company emc twitter linkedin vmware yahoo in the fourth quarter of our compensation governance committee reviewed our executive compensation against this peer group to ensure that our executive officer compensation was competitive and sufficient to recruit and retain our executive officers compensia provided the compensation governance committee with total cash compensation data base salaries and cash bonus awards at target and total compensation data total cash compensation and equity compensation at various percentiles while the compensation governance committee considered this data in determining executive officer compensation we did not seek to benchmark our executive compensation to any particular level the total compensation for our named executive officers was not determined based on any pre set target percentile of market rather we sought to compensate our executive officers at a level that would allow us to successfully recruit and retain the best possible talent for our executive team we relied heavily on the knowledge and experience of the compensation governance committee and our management in determining the appropriate compensation levels for our executive officers overall based on compensia s analysis of our peer group target total cash compensation for our executive officers was below the percentile of our peers when equity compensation was factored in without taking into account the effect of the deferred vesting start dates that are applicable to the equity compensation of our executive officers total compensation for our named executive officers other than our ceo fell between the and percentile relative to the companies in the peer group in the second quarter of the compensation governance committee reviewed the selection criteria and the companies in the peer group following that review the compensation governance committee decided not to make any changes to the composition of the peer group accordingly we plan to use the following list of companies in our peer group for the executive compensation process adobe microsoft alphabet netflix amazon com qualcomm apple salesforce com cisco systems sap ebay the walt disney company emc twitter linkedin vmware yahoo the compensation governance committee expects to periodically review and update this peer group and the underlying criteria as our business and market environment continue to evolve elements of executive compensation our executive officer compensation packages generally include base salary performance based cash incentives and equity based compensation in the form of rsus we believe that our compensation mix supports our objective of focusing on at risk compensation having significant financial upside based on company and individual performance we expect to continue to emphasize equity awards because of the direct link that equity compensation provides between stockholder interests and the interests of our executive officers thereby motivating our executive officers to focus on increasing our value over the long term base salary the compensation governance committee believes base salaries are a necessary element of compensation in order to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers the compensation governance committee reviews base salaries for our executive officers at least annually and may adjust them from time to time if needed to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors historically our executive officers have received base salaries within a very narrow range that was established when we were a smaller company with cash constraints and based on our desire to maintain internal pay equity between executive officers and also relative to other key employees as we have grown we have increased base salaries for our executive officers other than our ceo with the goal of bringing salaries closer to market over time in the first quarter of the compensation governance committee decided to increase the base salaries of our executive officers other than our ceo in order to continue to bring their salaries closer to those paid by our peer group companies for similar positions accordingly our compensation governance committee increased the base salary of ms sandberg by and messrs wehner cox and schroepfer by following these salary increases as noted above these executive officer salaries fell between the and percentile of the salaries provided by our peer group companies for executives in similar positions mr zuckerberg has previously requested to receive a base salary of per year named executive officer base salary mark zuckerberg sheryl k sandberg david m wehner christopher k cox mike schroepfer cash bonuses our bonus plan bonus plan provides variable cash incentives payable semi annually that are designed to motivate our executive officers to focus on company wide priorities and to reward them for individual results and achievements in the individual target bonus percentage for each named executive officer was unchanged from at of such executive s base salary after the base salary increases noted above target total cash compensation base salary plus target bonus for executive officers other than our ceo was at approximately the percentile of our peer group companies for executives in similar positions all of our executive officers except our ceo participated in the bonus plan in for there were two six month performance periods under our bonus plan which we refer to as first half and second half for each performance period in the compensation governance committee approved a set of companywide priorities in order to focus our executive officers on key areas of performance for the period in question the first half and second half company priorities reflect operational and non operational objectives established by our compensation governance committee in consultation with our ceo and cfo the company wide priorities do not have specific targets associated with them for purposes of determining performance under the bonus plan and our compensation governance committee has complete discretion to determine the level of bonus payout for each performance period priorities and company performance percentage our first half company wide priorities were as follows grow our user base across all our products increase sharing and engagement continue to achieve revenue growth and significant savings from efficiency improve product quality improve our brand and make progress toward our long term investments none of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the total bonus the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the company performance percentage on a qualitative basis taking into account our delivery of results in the areas identified by the company wide priorities approved by the compensation governance committee as well as our overall business engineering and product development achievements the compensation governance committee also did not determine any pre set ranges for the company performance percentage the first half company performance percentage approved by the compensation governance committee was the compensation governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company wide priorities our second half company wide priorities were as follows grow our user base across all of our products increase sharing engagement and utility continue to achieve revenue growth and significant savings from efficiency improve product quality improve our brand and make progress toward our long term investments none of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the total bonus the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the company performance percentage on a qualitative basis taking into account our delivery of results in the areas identified by the companywide priorities approved by the compensation governance committee as well as our overall business engineering and product development achievements the compensation governance committee also did not determine any pre set ranges for the company performance percentage the second half company performance percentage approved by the compensation governance committee was the compensation governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company wide priorities particularly the strength of our user growth and engagement and our continued strong revenue growth bonus plan payouts we calculate bonus plan payouts to each participant using the following formula base eligible earnings x individual bonus target percentage x individual performance percentage x company performance percentage individual bonus payout individual performance percentage the individual performance percentage is based upon each executive s individual performance assessment for the performance period under consideration in line with our pay for performance philosophy a higher performance assessment drives a higher individual percentage and vice versa such that it is possible for an executive with a low assessment to get less than their target bonus payout or no bonus payout whatsoever in potential individual performance percentages under our bonus plan were or an executive meeting our expected high level of performance expectations would receive an individual performance percentage of individual performance assessments for each executive officer were determined at the discretion of the compensation governance committee in close consultation with our ceo and our coo except in each case when their own performance assessment was being determined the performance assessment determinations were based on an overall subjective assessment of each officer s performance and no single factor was determinative in setting bonus levels nor was the impact of any individual factor on the bonus quantifiable we operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and we set a high bar for performance expectations for each one of our executive officers the compensation governance committee evaluates our executive officers based on their overall performance impact and results as well as their demonstration of strong leadership long term vision effective execution and management capabilities first half and second half payout levels and achievements and considerations for each executive were as follows mark zuckerberg mr zuckerberg did not participate in the bonus plan in although mr zuckerberg did not participate in the bonus plan the compensation governance committee separately assessed his performance as our ceo sheryl k sandberg ms sandberg received for the first half bonus which reflected her overall leadership and execution on business priorities her contribution to growing revenue including the continued growth in mobile ad revenue and her leadership in key policy matters ms sandberg received for the second half bonus which reflected her role in growing our revenue year over year her strategic guidance in various business matters and the strong growth in the number of advertisers on our platform david m wehner mr wehner received for the first half bonus which reflected his overall leadership of our finance organization and in particular driving long range planning for the company mr wehner received for the second half bonus which reflected his effective communication with our investors strategic facilities planning for our growing workforce and his contributions to the strong financial performance of the company as well as the overall performance of the finance function christopher k cox mr cox received for the first half bonus which reflected his overall leadership of the product organization improvements in the quality of news feed and his contributions to increases in user growth and engagement mr cox received for the second half bonus which reflected his leadership and innovations in the areas of product design and engagement such as reactions progress in our brand efforts and continued growth in time spent with our products mike schroepfer mr schroepfer received for the first half bonus which reflected his leadership and execution on our engineering priorities recruitment of engineering leadership talent and the continued development of a sustainable and cost effective engineering infrastructure mr schroepfer received for the second half bonus which reflected his strong leadership of the engineering team successful launch of gear vr and continued progress on other long term investments the following table summarizes the calculations that were used in determining the cash bonus paid to each of our named executive officers performance period base eligible earnings individual bonus

total christopher k cox first half second half total mike schroepfer first half second half total reflects actual earnings for which may differ from approved base salaries due to the effective dates of salary increases and the number of pay dates in the calendar year equity compensation most of our executive officers compensation is delivered through equity awards we use equity compensation to align our executive officers financial interests with those of our stockholders to attract industry leaders of the highest caliber and to retain them for the long term in addition to the initial equity grant that each executive receives as part of his or her new hire package the compensation governance committee typically grants our executives additional equity awards each year as part of our company wide equity refresher program additional equity grants for each of our executive officers are determined on a discretionary basis taking into account the following factors delivering equity values that are highly competitive when compared against those our peer group would grant to executives with similar responsibility each executive officer s individual performance assessment the results and contributions delivered during the year as well as the anticipated potential future impact of each individual executive the size and vesting schedule of existing equity grants in order to maximize the long term retentive power of all additional grants and the size of each executive officer s total cash compensation base salary plus cash bonus awards at target which is generally lower than the cash compensation for executives with similar responsibilities at our peer group based on the foregoing factors in our compensation governance committee awarded each of our executive officers other than our ceo a grant of rsus with a specific initial equity value based on an estimated total value for each grant before taking into account the deferred vesting considerations described below the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the specific individual equity values vesting schedules and vesting start dates based on these qualitative decisions the compensation governance committee then calculated the number of rsus to be granted by dividing this initial equity value by per share which was the average closing price for the seven trading days following the announcement of our earnings for the fourth quarter of and the same price that was used for refresher grants to all other employees vesting of rsu grants due to our desire to provide incentives for our executive officers to focus on long term strategic and financial objectives the compensation governance committee deferred the vesting start dates of all rsu grants made to our executive officers other than our cfo to a future date determined individually for each executive as a result the rsu grants generally will not begin to vest unless the recipient remains continuously employed by us through future dates as described in the following paragraphs and in grants of plan based awards table below the compensation governance committee reviewed the size and vesting schedule for the remaining unvested portion of the outstanding equity award holdings of each of our executive officers and agreed with the recommendation of our ceo and coo except that our coo did not participate in discussions regarding her own equity compensation that the existing equity awards appropriately satisfied our retention and incentive goals for the immediate future for each of our executive officers accordingly the additional equity awards granted to our executive officers in other than our cfo start vesting only after a significant portion of each executive s outstanding equity awards have vested the compensation governance committee believes that these deferred vesting schedules make the equity awards more valuable to us in retaining our executive officers and reflect our emphasis on our long term success in the case of our cfo the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate not to defer the vesting start date for mr wehner s rsu grant in order to increase his total compensation to a level appropriate for his new role as cfo typically the rsu grants for our executive officers vest over four years following the vesting start date the compensation and governance committee determined that it was appropriate to shorten the vesting schedule for ms sandberg and lengthen the vesting for mr wehner based on individual circumstances described below for more information relating to the vesting schedules of these rsu grants see grants of plan based awards table below equity grants mr zuckerberg did not receive any additional equity grants in because our compensation governance committee believed that his existing equity ownership position sufficiently aligns his interests with those of our stockholders our other named executive officers received the following rsu grants in sheryl k sandberg ms sandberg received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to three year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of november the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate for this rsu grant to vest over three years in order to deliver competitive compensation in future years david m wehner mr wehner received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to five year vesting with a one year cliff based on continued employment from and after a vesting start date of february such that one fifth of the shares shall vest on february and the remainder of the shares shall vest quarterly thereafter the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate for this rsu grant to vest over five years to increase the retentive power of this grant christopher k cox mr cox received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to four year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of february mike schroepfer mr schroepfer received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to four year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of february following the grants of these equity awards the total compensation for our named executive officers other than our ceo was between the and percentiles relative to the companies in our peer group compensation governance the compensation governance committee seeks to ensure sound executive compensation practices to adhere to our payfor performance philosophy while appropriately managing risk and aligning our compensation programs with long term stockholder interests the following practices were in effect during the compensation governance committee is comprised solely of independent directors the compensation governance committee conducts an annual review and approval of our compensation strategy with assistance from its independent compensation consultant compensia including a review of our compensation related risk profile to ensure that our compensation related risks are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company the compensation governance committee retains discretion on bonus payouts to enable it to respond to unforeseen events and adjust bonus payouts as appropriate we do not offer post employment benefits and our compensation philosophy and related governance features are complemented by several specific practices that are designed to align our executive compensation with long term stockholder interests including the following our executives are subject to company wide policies that prohibit hedging activities the pledging of our securities as collateral for loans and the shorting of our securities we offer limited perquisites that are for business related purposes or necessary for the security of our ceo and coo and our executives participate in broad based company sponsored health and welfare benefits programs on the same basis as our other full time salaried employees perquisites and other benefits consistent with the practices of many companies in our peer group we provide certain perquisites to our named executive officers for the reasons described below because of the high visibility of our company our compensation governance committee has authorized an overall security program for mr zuckerberg to address safety concerns due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder chairman and ceo we require these security measures for the company s benefit because of the importance of mr zuckerberg to facebook and we believe that the costs of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary we paid for the initial procurement installation and maintenance of security measures for mr zuckerberg s personal residences and we pay for the annual costs of security personnel in addition mr zuckerberg uses private aircraft for personal travel in connection with his overall security program on certain occasions mr zuckerberg may be accompanied by guests when using private aircraft although we do not consider mr zuckerberg s overall security program to be a perquisite for his benefit for the reasons described above the costs related to personal security for mr zuckerberg at his residence and during personal travel as well as the costs of private aircraft for personal travel pursuant to mr zuckerberg s overall security program are reported as other compensation to mr zuckerberg in the all other compensation column in summary compensation table below our compensation governance committee has also authorized a security program for ms sandberg including certain personal security measures to address safety concerns resulting from her position as our coo we require these security measures for the company s benefit because of the importance of ms sandberg to facebook and we believe the costs are appropriate and necessary the costs related to personal security for ms sandberg are reported as other compensation to ms sandberg in the all other compensation column in summary compensation table below say on pay vote we held a non binding advisory stockholder vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers commonly referred to as a say on pay vote at our annual meeting of stockholders over of the voting power of shares voted at the annual meeting of stockholders were cast in favor of our say on pay proposal our then compensation committee considered the result of this advisory vote to be an endorsement of our compensation program policies practices and philosophy for our named executive officers our compensation governance committee has considered and will continue to consider the outcome of our say on pay votes and our stockholder views when making compensation decisions for our named executive officers based on the results of a separate non binding advisory stockholder vote on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding the compensation program of our named executive officers commonly referred to as a say on frequency vote held at our annual meeting of stockholders our board of directors determined that we will hold our say on pay vote every three years until the next required say on frequency vote which will occur no later than we value the opinions of our stockholders and will continue to consider the outcome of future say on pay votes when we make compensation decisions for the members of our executive team including the named executive officers the next say on pay vote will take place at our annual meeting of stockholders m tax deductibility section m of the internal revenue code of as amended code limits the amount that we may deduct from our federal income taxes for remuneration paid to our named executive officers other than our cfo to million dollars per executive officer per year unless certain requirements are met section m provides an exception from this deduction limitation for certain forms of performance based compensation as well as for the gain recognized by covered executive officers upon the exercise of qualifying compensatory stock options in addition grandfather provisions may apply to certain compensation arrangements that were entered into by a corporation before it was publicly held and through april while our compensation governance committee is mindful of the benefit to us of the full deductibility of compensation our compensation governance committee believes that it should not be constrained by the requirements of section m where those requirements would impair flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives therefore our compensation governance committee has not adopted a policy that requires that all compensation be deductible and accordingly gain recognized from rsus granted after april may be non deductible our compensation governance committee intends to continue to compensate our executive officers in a manner consistent with the best interests of our company and our stockholders in addition because of the fact based nature of the performance based compensation exception under section m and the limited availability of formal guidance thereunder we cannot guarantee that any compensation arrangements intended to qualify for exemption under section m will actually receive this treatment compensation risk assessment our management team and the compensation governance committee each play a role in evaluating and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans practices and policies for all employees including our named executive officers in early compensia the compensation governance committee s independent compensation consultant performed an assessment in conjunction with management of our compensation plans and practices and concluded that our compensation program does not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company the compensation governance committee has reviewed this report and agreed with the conclusion the objective of the assessment was to identify any compensation plans or practices that may encourage employees to take unnecessary risk that could threaten the company no such plans or practices were identified the risk assessment process included among other things a review of our cash and equity incentivebased compensation plans to ensure that they are aligned with our company performance goals and the overall compensation to ensure an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay components and

connection with a termination or a change in control limitations on liability and indemnification matters our restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law consequently our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors except liability for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders any act or omission not in good faith or that

may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of as amended securities act may be permitted to directors executive officers or persons controlling us we have been informed that in the opinion of

with the launch of its next generation ad platform snapdeal has extended its ad platform to its entire three lakh seller community as of now over sellers are advertising on snapdeal ads these sellers

compensation benefits employee benefits employee benefits are optional non wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their normal wages or salaries these types of benefits may include group insurance health dental vision life etc disability income protection retirement benefits daycare tuition reimbursement sick leave vacation paid and non paid funding of education as well as flexible and alternative work arrangements in this section the benefits of benefits plan the basics health dental life ad d long term disability employee assistance plans eaps retirement benefits indirect non financial compensation the benefits of benefits plans although expensive there are many intrinsic benefits to providing your employees with a comprehensive benefit plan for most it is the ability to find and keep highly qualified staff that is the key driver with the sector being highly competitive and the number of new employees entering the workforce dwindling employers are challenged to become even more creative and responsive in the design timing and generosity of their benefit plans the more progressive the organization the more flexible the structure is in response to today s challenges i e like having four different generations of employees working side by side employers who continue to provide the more traditional and limited program may find it more difficult to find and keep different types of employees here are just a few of the advantages of offering benefits to your employees for employers by providing increased access and flexibility in employee benefits employers can not only recruit but retain qualified employees providing benefits to employees is seen as managing high risk coverage at low costs and easing the company s financial burden employee benefits have been proven to improve productivity because employees are more effective with they are assured of security for themselves and their families premiums are tax deductible as corporation expense which means savings for the organization for employees employees can experience a peace of mind which leads to increased productivity and satisfaction by being assured that they are their families are protected in any mishap employees with personal life and disability insurance can enjoy additional protection including income replacement in the event of serious illness or disability employees can feel a sense of pride in their employer if they are satisfied with the coverage they receive back to top the basics health dental health and dental benefits are considered the foundation of any benefit program design when considering the root issues of all absenteeism from the workplace most employers agree that health or dental related illness is cited most as the cause while many have not thought of dental coverage as being a key attraction point a number of medical reports have been published recently that indicate that many of our common virus and illnesses are actually related to poor dental health an organization s ability to be creative flexible and generous in providing health and dental coverage can be a key to attracting and retaining top performers as part of the total compensation package health even in canada where government plans provide approximately of all healthcare expenses the remaining gap is still perceived as a major concern for employees and employers private healthcare plans are restricted by legislation to expenses not fully covered by government programs organizational health expense plans are generally permitted in the following areas across canada hospital room charges in excess of the standard rate to cover semi private or private accommodation hospital charges for emergency treatment outside canada drugs medication and vaccines and other supplies available only by prescription professional services of a physician for out of country medical expenses professional services for private duty nursing charges for special medical appliances such as crutches artificial limbs or wheelchairs non emergency ambulance services dental treatments not requiring hospitalization professional services provided by licensed paramedicals such as psychologists massage therapists speech therapists podiatrists physiotherapists chiropractors osteopaths or naturopaths vision care expenses including frames and lenses contact lenses fitting and remedial treatment laser eye correction surgery this option is one that many employers struggle to provide their employees with as the number requiring vision care is so great the cost of including this option could raise the employer s costs by anywhere from to it is common practice to include many of the above items under a single extended healthcare plan most benefit carriers will tailor a plan to include only those features and coverage s desired certain items however are often restricted or sold in combination with other coverage s to contain overall plan costs or to subsidize heavily utilized services extended healthcare plan options should be selected based on the organization s overall compensation objectives and employee needs for small organizations the range of coverage options may be limited if the plans are financed on a fully insured basis these plans offer restricted flexibility to limit the occurrence of high risk claims these pre packaged plans are available to small organizations through affiliation with umbrella organizations such as chambers of commerce boards of trade trade associations and professional organizations for larger organizations the range of options is mostly limited by cost considerations dental dental plan design is the art of finding a delicate balance between understanding what the foundational priorities are and allocating sufficient funds to ensure that the coverage is perceived as being sufficient and appropriate although the type of dental work can differ from person to person some common elements have been found most employees their spouses and children require basic preventative dental care and repair therefore most employers elect to design the plan in such a way as to minimize the cost to employees of basic coverage since major restorative care and orthodontics tend to be more elective in nature and less common in need across the employee group than basic services most plans do not provide equal coverage in all areas for example the plan might pay of basic and of the other two categories it is also common to find deductibles co insurance and benefit maximums for the non basic services to free up more funds for the necessary preventive ones high employee deductibles and co insurance percentages can help to limit plan disbursements because employees will be paying more of the total costs the potential problem is that these high employee costs may in effect force postponement of needed dental work until the repair bill is even higher paying of basic preventative care from day one is the overwhelming choice of employers having the dental plan require a pre treatment evaluation for certain expenses helps control cost levels by ensuring that the plan only pays for reasonable treatments it also avoids any misunderstanding by the employee as to what services are covered and how much he or she is required to pay it is always preferable to ensure the employee knows what the plan will pay for and what exact dollar amount is their responsibility a commonly asked question of benefit administrators is why the dental plan is not optional but compulsory if the plan is optional only those employees who are likely to need dental care will sign up they will almost always use services that exceed their contributions deductibles and co insurance those who feel that the benefits will not cover their costs will decline because of this adverse selection cost per employee will be so high that employers would not be perceived as competitive back to top life and ad d most employers design their plans with a provision to protect the employee and or their family in the event of accidental death or dismemberment ad d employers often provide basic coverage as a factor of the employee s salary example the employee s salary in the event of death or total paralysis with additional coverage available should the employee chose to purchase it each employee benefit plan should include a chart that identifies what coverage is available and the associated cost back to top long term disability long term disability is an income replacement provision this is one provision that cannot be purchased through a spousal plan employees are asked to pay the total cost of the premiums in order to receive a tax free payment should they be unable to work long term disability coverage is applied for when an employee is unable to complete a certain percentage of the essential duties of their role due to illness on an ongoing basis the structure of each plan can differ slightly so understanding what you are trying to achieve with this program including elimination periods and termination options is critical at the outset employee assistance plans eaps an eap or employee assistance program is a confidential short term counseling service for employees with personal problems that affect their work performance studies have shown that providing confidential qualified counseling and support can reduce the stress and conflict felt by the employee which in turn can reduce absenteeism and ultimately turnover one on one sessions are offered and online information coaching and support services are also available employees turn to the eap for help with a variety of issues including the following dependent care issues such as searching for child care information identifying services for special needs children obtaining advice on the college application process or arranging for residential care for an elder dealing with the stress of a major life change even a positive one such as having or adopting a child getting married moving or buying a home or getting a promotion serious personal or professional concerns such as general anxiety depression substance abuse burnout coping with illness the loss of a loved one relationship challenges or resolving interpersonal conflicts different types of programs are available to employers to provide employee assistance employers can establish their own in house programs join a consortium of organizations to provide external services or refer employees to public and private providers of this service the range of costs across these options can vary widely organizations must then decide the most advantageous approach to achieve the level of improved wellness among their employees in selecting the best eap provider several factors need to be considered how accessible and convenient are the services to be provided location of offices and confidentially concerns are important here how is the quality of services to be measured how is client satisfaction to be assessed how are service costs to be determined and will there be limits placed on the frequency and extent of services provided what will the charges be per hour of service per individual before choosing an eap provider these questions need to be answered and the answers reflected in any service proposal or contract back to top retirement benefits a retirement plan or a pension is an arrangement by an employer to provide their employees with an income when they are no longer earning a regular income from working retirement plans may be set up by in a variety of ways but typically will have a form of a guaranteed payment often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money into a fund while employed so that they will receive benefits upon retirement pension plans are considered a form of delayed income pension plans pension plans are usually classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the payments are determined a defined benefit plan guarantees a predictable monthly payment at retirement calculated by using an established formula with some combination of the employee s salary years of service and or age a defined contribution plan will provide a payment payout at retirement that will be determined by the amount of money contributed during the life of the plan and the performance of the stock or investments used registered retirement savings plans a registered retirement savings plan or rrsp is an account that provides tax benefits for saving for retirement yet is not necessarily based on the employer employee relationship rrsps can provide ways to save money for retirement and defer and reduce taxes because contributions to rrsps up to established limits may be deducted from income in pre taxed dollars income earned within the account is not taxed until money is withdrawn from the plan rrsp accounts can be setup with as either individual rrsp an individual rrsp is associated with only a single individual only they contribute money to their rrsp spousal rrsp the spouse of the contributor is actually the account holder a spousal rrsp is a means of splitting income in retirement group rrsp an employer can arrange for employees to make contributions through a schedule of regular payroll deductions in many organizations rrsp contributions can be based on a matching program this means that the employer will put in a certain percentage or dollar amount based on the contributions the employee makes the employee gets to receive the tax savings immediately at the time of deduction instead of having to wait until the end of the tax year phased retirement today s work place is challenged with having up to four different generations working side by side for most employers designing a compensation and benefit structure that address the unique needs of each demographic group is a complex task added to that is the shift in pension structures over the past few years some non profit organizations provide their employees with a pension fund however most tend to offer only contributions to an rrsp this leads to an increasing number of employees not feeling able to retire it is important that organizations understand the details of their pension plan whether it is a defined benefit or contribution or simply an rrsp program before considering design changes for those not hindered by a design change one option that is gaining in popularity especially in this sector is providing a phased retirement program for older skilled employees for employees components of the phased program are allowing employees who might be considering retiring to delay their departure date continue to earn a partial income that reduces the burden on their pension income they continue to receive benefit coverage and are able to acclimate gradually by continuing to reduce their hours until they are prepared to leave for employers employers are able to develop a timely and effective succession plan without losing critical skills or intellectual capital organizations benefit by being able to tap into the most experienced staff at a reduced salary while transitioning to a new team or organizational design hurdles employees need to understand the impact continuing to work may have on pension or benefit programs also to be considered is the timing of starting your phased approach if an employee starts too soon they might not have accumulated enough to compensate for the reduced salary employers need to be sure that the phased retirement program is structured in a way that will not diminish the work of the organization or the financial position of the employee back to top indirect non financial compensation indirect compensation will look different in every organization ultimately it is the way in which you choose to define the culture of your organization and your total compensation rewards program that will differentiate it of course it is important to ensure it aligns with organizational strategic objectives recent studies all indicate that in today s changing work environment it is the flexibility and creativity that draws and keeps the highly skilled employee benefit perspective from a benefit perspective being creative and considering ways to improve the access or quality of your benefits could look like allowing employees to access their benefit as of their hire date being able to accumulate sick days to bridge to disability coverage being able to use some sick days as personal health days to allow employees to have a break without using all their holidays or pretending to be sick receiving your birthday off with pay eliminating the probationary period language from contracts offer letters seeking insurance providers with vision care benefits at reasonable costs allowing for some increased flexibility in personalizing benefit options i e health spending accounts vision care versus dental and more paramedical coverage although these options have a cost associated with them the cost is significantly less than the benefit an organization can reap in return if your insurance provider does not allow you the freedom to make some adjustments in your plan then it might be time to research what else is available other perspectives many articles have been written highlighting the keys to creating the best organization and to finding and keeping the best employees in recent studies the following were identified as key factors compensation paying employees fairly against both the market conditions as well as ensuring internal equity was still the number one factor considered providing clear information on the organization s compensation structure and consistent processes were critical to an employee s sense of commitment professional development for many people especially the younger generations the ability to develop both personally and professionally was highly valued and a key consideration deciding where to work access to training and development on the job and through courses or conferences were listed in a study done by the conference board of canada as important another variation of this was receiving reimbursement for courses taken on the employee s own time most commonly reimbursed were courses that aligned with a professional designation in the employees current role culture employees who were surveyed and asked what kept them in their current role indicated that having a culture that recognized the importance of connecting performance to rewards were key to their satisfaction performance management was one component that influenced the culture having clearly defined expectations being able to identify goals to work towards and having their evaluation align with those agreed to goals contributed to higher satisfaction levels receiving effective and realistic feedback both positive and constructive increased a continuous learning environment and increases commitment to the organization because performance both good and bad is recognized succession planning when operating within an organization brings a sense of purpose and sustainability to employees confidence in the future and their role it in was reported consistently by those who had been identified for a succession plan consider ways to develop younger staff with great potential by having them be identified as a potential successor to a long term employee the employee wins by learning new and critical skills while feeling rewarded for their hard work to date the more senior person feels rewarded for years of service and identified as a key contributor the organization wins by ensuring that intellectual capital is not lost but transitioned from one employee to another trust demonstrated as part of the culture of an organization is highly valued by all generations of employees in steven covey s book moving at the speed of trust leaders are challenged to evaluate if their organization s culture is one of trust or mistrust employees who feel trusted and respected will strive harder to maintain that trust and are less likely to do something that will result in a loss of trust workplace flexibility alternative work arrangements are effective ways to negotiate an arrangement that meet the needs of the organization while also providing employees will what they need to balance their home and work environments listed below are just some of the ideas that could be explored finding out what your organization would value can start this process the key is to ensure that any alternative arrangements considered do not hinder the organization s ability to ensure that core work is being completed in the time and manner required to maintain sustainability having clear expectations on both the organization and the employee s part as to the terms and conditions of the alternative work arrangement can prevent ineffective or damaging results flexible time this can be establishing core hours then allowing employees to work earlier in the day or later in the day example core hours are to person a starts at and works till person b works from to seasonal hours can be established in a variety of terms just as flexible hours schedule of part time employees example hiring a part time person to work days a week or a but they actually work full time for months a year and then take a combination of their time vacation and hours and take a month in the summer and a month in the winter off work they would continue to receive the salary for months a year compressed work week allowing an employee to work their full number of hours in less days example core hours are hours per week the employee works hours days instead of hour days job sharing having qualified employees share the duties and tasks of one position both could work days or alternative between days one week and the next the advantage of job sharing is having people who both know the role the downside can be having a communication gap between individuals doing the role consider having an employee who is contemplating retirement job share with a more junior employee with high potential transition knowledge skills and commitment telecommuting this is the practice of allowing an employee work from their home location instead of on your premises there are guidelines governing the considerations for this type of employment in the past ten years the number of people telecommuting has tripled with results indicating that increased productivity and effectiveness were seen from this type of working arrangement regular part time work many people today are looking for meaningful work but on a part time basis a desire to balance work and life priorities has increased exponentially over the past decade and employers who recognize the contribution part time employees can make are leading their organizations forward educational partnership many employees are looking for opportunities to balance academic pursuits with employment opportunities considering how you could structure a role for a person in the final stages of their education could result in an increased pool of potential employees and employees who will be loyal to an organization that provided with them practical experience and the ability to create a flexible schedule regardless of whether you are developing an alternative work arrangement or increasing the flexibility of your benefit program it is important to understand what motivates employees and what culture you are building in your organization the better able you are to align the two together the increased success you will have

the european commission has concluded that ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to billion to apple this is illegal under eu state aid rules because it allowed apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses ireland must now recover the illegal aid commissioner margrethe vestager in charge of competition policy said member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies this is illegal under eu state aid rules the commission s investigation concluded that ireland granted illegal tax benefits to apple which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years in fact this selective treatment allowed apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of per cent on its european profits in down to per cent in following an in depth state aid investigation launched in june the european commission has concluded that two tax rulings issued by ireland to apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by apple in ireland since the rulings endorsed a way to establish the taxable profits for two irish incorporated companies of the apple group apple sales international and apple operations europe which did not correspond to economic reality almost all sales profits recorded by the two companies were internally attributed to a head office the commission s assessment showed that these head offices existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits these profits allocated to the head offices were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the irish tax law which are no longer in force as a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from in to in on the profits of apple sales international this selective tax treatment of apple in ireland is illegal under eu state aid rules because it gives apple a significant advantage over other businesses that are subject to the same national taxation rules the commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a ten year period preceding the commission s first request for information in ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in ireland from apple for the years to of up to billion plus interest in fact the tax treatment in ireland enabled apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of apple products in the entire eu single market this is due to apple s decision to record all sales in ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold this structure is however outside the remit of eu state aid control if other countries were to require apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules this would reduce the amount to be recovered by ireland apple s tax structure in europe apple sales international and apple operations europe are two irish incorporated companies that are fully owned by the apple group ultimately controlled by the us parent apple inc they hold the rights to use apple s intellectual property to sell and manufacture apple products outside north and south america under a so called cost sharing agreement with apple inc under this agreement apple sales international and apple operations europe make yearly payments to apple in the us to fund research and development efforts conducted on behalf of the irish companies in the us these payments amounted to about us billion in and significantly increased in these expenses mainly borne by apple sales international contributed to fund more than half of all research efforts by the apple group in the us to develop its intellectual property worldwide these expenses are deducted from the profits recorded by apple sales international and apple operations europe in ireland each year in line with applicable rules the taxable profits of apple sales international and apple operations europe in ireland are determined by a tax ruling granted by ireland in which in was replaced by a similar second tax ruling this tax ruling was terminated when apple sales international and apple operations europe changed their structures in apple sales internationalapple sales international is responsible for buying apple products from equipment manufacturers around the world and selling these products in europe as well as in the middle east africa and india apple set up their sales operations in europe in such a way that customers were contractually buying products from apple sales international in ireland rather than from the shops that physically sold the products to customers in this way apple recorded all sales and the profits stemming from these sales directly in ireland the two tax rulings issued by ireland concerned the internal allocation of these profits within apple sales international rather than the wider set up of apple s sales operations in europe specifically they endorsed a split of the profits for tax purposes in ireland under the agreed method most profits were internally allocated away from ireland to a head office within apple sales international this head office was not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings only a fraction of the profits of apple sales international were allocated to its irish branch and subject to tax in ireland the remaining vast majority of profits were allocated to the head office where they remained untaxed therefore only a small percentage of apple sales international s profits were taxed in ireland and the rest was taxed nowhere in for example according to figures released at us senate public hearings apple sales international recorded profits of us billion c a billion but under the terms of the tax ruling only around million were considered taxable in ireland leaving billion of profits untaxed as a result apple sales international paid less than million of corporate tax in ireland in an effective tax rate of about on its overall annual profits in subsequent years apple sales international s recorded profits continued to increase but the profits considered taxable in ireland under the terms of the tax ruling did not thus this effective tax rate decreased further to only in apple operations europeon the basis of the same two tax rulings from and apple operations europe benefitted from a similar tax arrangement over the same period of time the company was responsible for manufacturing certain lines of computers for the apple group the majority of the profits of this company were also allocated internally to its head office and not taxed anywhere commission assessmenttax rulings as such are perfectly legal they are comfort letters issued by tax authorities to give a company clarity on how its corporate tax will be calculated or on the use of special tax provisions the role of eu state aid control is to ensure member states do not give selected companies a better tax treatment than others via tax rulings or otherwise more specifically profits must be allocated between companies in a corporate group and between different parts of the same company in a way that reflects economic reality this means that the allocation should be in line with arrangements that take place under commercial conditions between independent businesses so called arm s length principle in particular the commission s state aid investigation concerned two consecutive tax rulings issued by ireland which endorsed a method to internally allocate profits within apple sales international and apple operations europe two irish incorporated companies it assessed whether this endorsed method to calculate the taxable profits of each company in ireland gave apple an undue advantage that is illegal under eu state aid rules the commission s investigation has shown that the tax rulings issued by ireland endorsed an artificial internal allocation of profits within apple sales international and apple operations europe which has no factual or economic justification as a result of the tax rulings most sales profits of apple sales international were allocated to its head office when this head office had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business or any other substantive business for that matter only the irish branch of apple sales international had the capacity to generate any income from trading i e from the distribution of apple products therefore the sales profits of apple sales international should have been recorded with the irish branch and taxed there the head office did not have any employees or own premises the only activities that can be associated with the head offices are limited decisions taken by its directors many of which were at the same time working full time as executives for apple inc on the distribution of dividends administrative arrangements and cash management these activities generated profits in terms of interest that based on the commission s assessment are the only profits which can be attributed to the head offices similarly only the irish branch of apple operations europe had the capacity to generate any income from trading i e from the production of certain lines of computers for the apple group therefore sales profits of apple operation europe should have been recorded with the irish branch and taxed there on this basis the commission concluded that the tax rulings issued by ireland endorsed an artificial allocation of apple sales international and apple operations europe s sales profits to their head offices where they were not taxed as a result the tax rulings enabled apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies which is illegal under eu state aid rules this decision does not call into question ireland s general tax system or its corporate tax rate

in this document refer to facebook inc a delaware corporation and where appropriate its wholly owned subsidiaries the term facebook may also refer to our products regardless of the manner in which they are accessed for references to accessing facebook on the web or via a website such terms refer to accessing facebook on personal computers for references to accessing facebook on mobile such term refers to accessing facebook via a mobile application or via a mobile optimized version of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet limitations of key metrics and other data the numbers for our key metrics which include our daily active users daus mobile daus monthly active users maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than of our worldwide maus in we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories user misclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or non human entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in for example we estimate user misclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while user provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varies by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the user s ip address and self disclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the user s actual location for example a mobile only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user s actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses the numbers of daus mobile daus maus mobile maus mobile only daus and mobile only maus discussed in this annual report on form k as well as arpu do not include users of instagram or whatsapp unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics included herein do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated part i item business overview our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected our top priority is to build

security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people s data foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states u s federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the european legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for non compliance in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations various laws and regulations in the united states and abroad such as the u s bank secrecy act the dodd frank act the usa patriot act and the credit card act impose certain anti money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services under these laws and regulations financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value or prepaid access products requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and are applying for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfers anti money laundering charitable fundraising counter terrorist financing gambling banking and lending financial privacy and data security and

information contained in this annual report on form k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment risks related to our business and industry if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if users increasingly engage with other products or services we fail to introduce new products or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency prominence format size and quality of ads that we display users have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services user behavior on any of our products changes including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance there are decreases in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products or concerns related to privacy and sharing safety security or other factors we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is interesting useful and relevant to them we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third party content users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services or may not be featured or otherwise available there are adverse changes in our products that are mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation including settlements or consent decrees technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content we adopt terms policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing or user data that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public we elect to focus our user growth and engagement efforts more on longer term initiatives or if initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued whether as a result of actions by us third parties or otherwise we fail to provide adequate customer service to users marketers or developers we developers whose products are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity or our current or future products such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third party mobile and web applications if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook for and advertising accounted for and respectively of our revenue in addition we have recently introduced advertising on instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have long term advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us we expect our ability to grow advertising revenue will continue to be dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us or the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including decreases in user engagement including time spent on our products our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our mobile products product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand the pricing of our ads or both our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users changes to third party policies that limit our ability to deliver or target advertising on mobile devices the availability accuracy and utility of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers or our ability to further improve such tools loss of advertising market share to our competitors including if prices for purchasing ads on facebook increase or if competitors offer lower priced or more integrated products adverse legal developments relating to advertising including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us content on our products developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry the degree to which users opt out of certain types of ad targeting the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they click on our ads changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced and the impact of macroeconomic conditions whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems any changes in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long term best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long term benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communication and the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products that replicate the full range of capabilities we provide for example google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and video sharing and micro blogging and companies that provide web and mobile based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent on mobile devices and online in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences and or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook products and services and we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with facebook in favor of increased engagement with these other products and services in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in user engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more far reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook may use information shared by our users through facebook in order to develop products or features that compete with us certain competitors including google could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines or web browsers by making acquisitions by limiting or denying our access to advertising measurement or delivery systems by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or by making it more difficult to communicate with our users as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products compared to our competitors products particularly with respect to mobile products the size and composition of our user base the engagement of our users with our products and competing products the timing and market acceptance of products including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors products our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users our ability to monetize our products the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors customer service and support efforts marketing and selling efforts including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments our ability to establish and maintain developers interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other products changes mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation including settlements and consent decrees some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us acquisitions or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitors our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees particularly software engineers designers and product managers our ability to cost effectively manage and grow our operations and our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected action by governments to restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example in july we acquired oculus vr inc oculus a company developing virtual reality technology we do not have prior experience with consumer hardware products or virtual reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market oculus products or technology and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technology in addition in october we acquired whatsapp inc whatsapp and we have also invested significant resources in growing messenger we have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short term financial results we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to deliver the most relevant content to our users which may adversely affect the distribution of content of marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their development and marketing efforts on facebook we also may introduce changes to existing products or introduce new stand alone products that direct users away from properties where we have a proven means of monetization for example we have taken action to redirect users who send messages from within the facebook application to our stand alone messenger application although we do not monetize the stand alone messenger application in any significant manner in addition we plan to continue focusing on growing the user base for whatsapp and potentially other stand alone applications that may have limited or no near term monetization and it is possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application we also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of mobile products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term these decisions may not produce the long term benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with marketers and developers and our business and results of operations could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third party mobile and web applications integrated with facebook we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy and other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brands we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users or by users acting under false or inauthentic identities by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security related purposes or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business our industry is prone to cyber attacks with third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future as a result of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users to lose confidence in our products or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance government surveillance or other factors in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the actions of our users or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year or other factors the frequency prominence size format and quality of ads shown to users the pricing of our ads and other products our ability to maintain or increase payments and other fees revenue the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on facebook the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors increases in marketing sales and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins costs related to acquisitions including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet our ability to obtain equipment and components for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost effective manner system failures or outages which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time breaches of security or privacy and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third party actions fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products share based compensation expense including acquisition related expense adverse litigation judgments settlements or other litigation related costs changes in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy and data protection or enforcement by government regulators including fines orders or consent decrees the overall tax rate for our business which may be affected by a number of factors including the financial results of our international subsidiaries and the timing size and integration of acquisitions we may make from time to time tax obligations that may arise from changes in laws or resolutions of tax examinations that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates changes in u s generally accepted accounting principles and changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve greater market penetration for example the growth rate of our revenue declined from from to to from to we expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount of content they consume and the data they share with us as we develop and implement new products and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations we expect to continue to invest in our global connectivity efforts which may not have a clear path to monetization we may also be subject to increased costs in order to obtain and attract third party content or to facilitate the distribution of our products in addition we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our oculus products any such investments may not be successful and any such increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability our business is subject to complex and evolving u s and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy and data protection rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations in addition foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states these u s federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process and or receive transnational data that is critical to our operations including data relating to users customers or partners outside the united states and those laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change for example in october the european court of justice invalidated the european commission s safe harbour decision as a legitimate basis on which facebook could rely for the transfer of data from the european union to the united states in addition the other bases on which facebook relies are likely to be subject to regulatory or judicial scrutiny if facebook is unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which it operates it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results proposed legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the european legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for non compliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services these existing and proposed laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries investigations or actions can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquires in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of consumer and data protection as we continue to grow and expand our operations for example several data protection authorities in europe have initiated actions seeking to assert jurisdiction over facebook inc and our subsidiaries and to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information and other data protection authorities may do the same orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a non profit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code and or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various non practicing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non practicing entities from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party s rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative non infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative non infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages and or seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per user harm is small or non existent in addition we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our ipo we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy and personal injury torts this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for third party actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial for example in we paid approximately billion in cash and issued million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our acquisition of whatsapp and we paid approximately million in cash and issued million shares of our class b common stock in connection with our acquisition of oculus we also issued a substantial number of rsus to help retain the employees of these companies there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions in the future we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our common stock we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example oculus and whatsapp are larger and more complex than companies we have historically acquired in particular oculus builds technology and products that are new to facebook and with which we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support prior to the acquisition we are making substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed if our goodwill or finite lived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we review our finite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finite lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite lived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted as our user base and engagement continue to grow and the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve such as increased engagement with video we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users it is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities our business could be adversely affected our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally and or by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors vulnerabilities or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in measurement or billing errors compromise our ability to protect the data of our users and or our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example social games on facebook rely on adobe flash which games are currently responsible for substantially all of our payments revenue in july certain vulnerabilities discovered in flash led to temporary interruption of support for flash by popular web browsers if similar interruptions occur in the future and disrupt our ability to provide social games to some or all of our users our ability to generate payments revenue would be harmed any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects discovered in the software on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads particularly advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than of our worldwide maus in we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories user misclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or non human entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in for example we estimate that such user misclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while user provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varied by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the user s ip address and self disclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the user s actual location for example a mobile only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user s actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to as of december from as of december and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our third party relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at will employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custom made for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high as we mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively we may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile and or web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers and we expect that our payments revenue will continue to decline in the future as usage of facebook on personal computers continues to decline we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers specifically applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games we have experienced and expect to see the continued decline in usage of facebook on personal computers for the foreseeable future which we expect will result in a continuing decline in payments revenue in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebook integrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of facebook on personal computers or otherwise if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook or if facebook integrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance could be adversely affected payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and are applying for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook is not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to third party vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including political social or economic instability risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance intellectual property and terrestrial infrastructure matters potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls foreign exchange controls and tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the united states or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulties in staffing managing and overseeing global operations and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations compliance with the u s foreign corrupt practices act the u k bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions and compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our oculus products for example the oculus products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our oculus products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our financial results could be adversely affected we rely on third parties to manufacture our oculus products we may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them we also require the suppliers and business partners of our oculus products to comply with law and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to our reputation in addition the securities and exchange commission s conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of the origin source and chain of custody of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured we may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule such as costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the minerals used in oculus products the adoption of conflict minerals related governance policies processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities we may face inventory risk with respect to our oculus products we may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our oculus products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to oculus products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products oculus may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new oculus product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition in august we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes as of december no amounts were outstanding under this facility if we draw down on this facility in the future our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase significantly which could have an adverse effect on our financial results we may require additional capital to support our business growth and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms if at all we may require additional capital to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances our ability to obtain additional capital if and when required will depend on our business plans investor demand our operating performance the condition of the capital markets and other factors if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equity linked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock and our existing stockholders may experience dilution if we are unable to obtain additional capital when required or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to regular review and audit by u s federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position and results of operations many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business for example in the united kingdom enacted the diverted profits tax and australia passed the tax integrity multinational anti avoidance law both of which could increase our tax obligations the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project and has issued in and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations in addition the current u s administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to u s tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer u s taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may at a price of per share our stock price has ranged from to through december in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results the financial projections we may provide to the public any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors additional shares of our class a common stock being sold into the market by us our existing stockholders or in connection with acquisitions including shares sold by our employees to cover tax liabilities in connection with rsu vesting events or the anticipation of such sales investor sentiment with respect to our competitors our business partners and our industry in general announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features technical innovations acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base the level of user engagement or the effectiveness of our ad products changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry including our developers and competitors price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole the inclusion or deletion of our class a common stock from any trading indices such as the s p index media coverage of our business and financial performance lawsuits threatened or filed against us developments in anticipated or new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions including interim or final rulings by tax judicial or regulatory bodies and other events or factors including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism or responses to these events in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of our class a common stock increases in addition our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the ten to one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock we have elected to take advantage of the controlled company exemption to the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies which could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have an independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock our status as a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than of the combined voting power of our common stock any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding class b common stock voting as a separate class we have a dual class common stock structure which provides mr zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two thirds of the combined vote of our then outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent only our chairman our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and certain litigation against us can only be brought in delaware item unresolved staff comments none item properties our corporate headquarters are located in menlo park california as of december we owned and leased approximately two million square feet for our corporate headquarters and acres of land to accommodate anticipated future growth in addition we leased office and data center facilities

other jurisdictions against us our directors and or certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other trading related errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings in the u s district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in and the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers on july the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions on december the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec in addition we are also currently parties to multiple other lawsuits related to our products including intellectual property lawsuits as well as class action lawsuits

obligations long term debt total liabilities additional paid in capital total stockholders equity in november the fasb issued accounting standards update no income taxes topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified all of our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets data for all periods presented as a result of the reclassifications certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities as of december and were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets free cash flow in addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap we monitor free cash flow fcf as a non gaap measure to manage our business make planning decisions evaluate our performance and allocate resources we define fcf as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and property and equipment acquired under capital leases we believe that fcf is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business we have chosen to subtract both purchases of property and equipment and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in our calculation of fcf because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business regardless of whether we finance such property or equipment with a capital lease the market for financing servers and other technical equipment is dynamic and we expect our use of capital leases could vary significantly from year to year we have chosen our definition for fcf because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business we use fcf in discussions with our senior management and board of directors fcf has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other gaap financial measures such as net cash provided by operating activities some of the limitations of fcf are fcf does not reflect our future contractual commitments and other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the fcf measure through disclosure of such limitations presentation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap and reconciliation of fcf to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities as presented below the following is a reconciliation of fcf to the most comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities year ended december in millions net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment property and equipment acquired under capital leases free cash flow for the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by million of income tax refundable from income tax loss carrybacks due to the recognition of tax benefits related to share based compensation from restricted stock units granted prior to january we received substantially all of this refund in which increased our net cash provided by operating activities and fcf for the year ended december item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k particularly in part i item risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form k certain revenue information in the sections entitled executive overview of full year results and revenue foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a non gaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year using monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u s dollar this non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year over year comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this non gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business executive overview of full year results our key user metrics and financial results for are as follows user growth daily active users daus were billion on average for december an increase of year over year mobile daus were million on average for december an increase of year over year monthly active users maus were billion as of december an increase of year over year mobile maus were billion as of december an increase of year over year financial results revenue was billion up year over year or year over year on a constant currency basis and ad revenue was billion up year over year or year over year on a constant currency basis total costs and expenses were billion income from operations was billion net income was billion with diluted earnings per share of capital expenditures were billion effective tax rate was cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion as of december headcount was as of december in we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities i continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile ii growing the number of marketers using our ad products and iii making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers in addition we invested and will continue to invest across three priorities i our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses ii our next generation of services such as instagram messenger and whatsapp and iii our long term innovation efforts such as connectivity efforts virtual reality and artificial intelligence research we expect these investments will continue to drive significant overall year over year expense growth compared to trends in our user metrics the numbers for our key metrics our daily active users daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu and certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures daily active users daus we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we view daus and daus as a percentage of maus as measures of user engagement note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east worldwide daus increased to billion on average during december from million during december we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india the united states and brazil overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december compared to the same period in we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions mobile daus we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we define a mobile only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day worldwide mobile daus increased to million on average during december from million during december in all regions an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during december as compared to the same period during with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during december on average during december there were million mobileonly daus increasing from million mobile only daus during the same period in the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future monthly active users maus we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user in the last days as of the date of measurement maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community as of december we had billion maus an increase of from december users in india the united states and brazil represented key sources of growth in overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december compared to the same period in we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions mobile maus we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user during the period of measurement we define a mobile only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement worldwide mobile maus increased to billion as of december from billion as of december in all regions an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in as compared to the same period in with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in there were million mobile only maus as of december increasing from million mobile only maus during the same period in the remaining million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during december we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in in the united states canada region was more than seven times higher than in the asia pacific region note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue generating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer for worldwide arpu was an increase of from over this period arpu increased by in united states canada in europe in asia pacific and in rest of world the general strengthening of the u s dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from to had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our arpu outside the united states and canada region in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such as asia pacific and rest of world such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes share based compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k revenue recognition for payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers people can make payments on facebook by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the facebook website the price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties share based compensation we account for share based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all share based payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award share based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share based awards that we expect to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued post acquisition employment we have accounted for them as post acquisition share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management s expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired as of december no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets has been identified acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life components of results of operations revenue advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties including our mobile applications and third party affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by people the number of actions taken by people or the number of impressions delivered we recognize revenue from the delivery of click based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content and action based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impression based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression click or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor we recognize revenue on a net basis payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games our other fees revenue which has not been significant in recent periods consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the

good from a developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of the transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer the price of the purchase is an amount that is solely determined by the developer our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the service performed we record revenue on a net basis as we do

recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such only those share based awards that we expect to vest are recorded we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued post acquisition employment we have accounted for them as post acquisition share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award during the years ended december and we realized tax benefits from share based award activity of billion billion and million respectively these amounts reflect the extent that the total reduction to our income tax liability from share based award activity was greater than the amount of the deferred tax assets that we had previously recorded in anticipation of these benefits these amounts are the aggregate of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that we recorded reduced by any individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded these net amounts were recorded as an adjustment to stockholders equity in each period as an increase to cash flows from operating activities and were not recognized in our consolidated statements of income in addition we reported excess tax benefits that decreased our cash flows from operating activities and increased our cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december and by billion billion and million respectively the amounts of these excess tax benefits reflect the total of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that were recorded but were not reduced by any of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded income taxes we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities these differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse we recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties advertising expense advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income we incurred advertising expenses of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds with maturities of days or less from the date of purchase we hold investments in marketable securities consisting of u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations our available for sale investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses net of taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in stockholders equity unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income expense net when a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthan temporary we have not recorded any such impairment charge in the periods presented we determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other income expense net we classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions fair value of financial instruments we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs our valuation technique used to measure the fair value of our contingent consideration liability was based on the present value of probability weighted future cash flows related to the contingent earn out criteria and the fair value of our common stock on each reporting date accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts we make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of our customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay property and equipment property and equipment which includes amounts recorded under capital leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term in the case of a capital lease whichever is shorter the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below property and equipment useful life network equipment three to five years buildings three to years computer software office equipment and other three to five years leased equipment and leasehold improvements lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use the cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations lease obligations we lease office space data centers and equipment under non cancelable capital and operating leases with various expiration dates through certain of the operating lease agreements contain rent holidays rent escalation provisions and purchase options rent holidays and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the straight line rent expense to be recorded over the lease term the lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the leased property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease we do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease inception we record assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred by third parties under build to suit lease arrangements to the extent that we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or bear construction risk prior to commencement of a lease loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired as of december no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets has been identified acquired indefinite lived intangible assets related to our in process research and development ipr d are capitalized and subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects upon successful completion of each project we will make a separate determination of useful life of the acquired indefinite lived intangible assets and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life of the specific projects acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life deferred revenue and deposits deferred revenue consists of billings in advance of revenue recognition deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users once this balance is utilized by a user approximately of this amount would then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue deferred revenue and deposits consists of the following in millions december deferred revenue deposits total deferred revenue and deposits foreign currency generally the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to u s dollars using month end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for revenue costs and expenses translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a component of stockholders equity as of december and we had a cumulative translation loss net of tax of million and million respectively net losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions were million million and million for the years ended december and respectively these losses were recorded as interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income credit risk and concentration our financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents restricted cash marketable securities and accounts receivable cash equivalents consist of short term money market funds which are managed by reputable financial institutions marketable securities consist of investments in u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities our investment policy limits investment instruments to u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries we generated and of our revenue for the years ended december and respectively from marketers and developers based in the united states with the majority of revenue outside of the united states coming from customers located in western europe china brazil canada and australia we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses during the years ended december and our bad debt expenses were million million and million respectively in the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected no customer represented or more of total revenue during the years ended december and segments our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer who makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis there are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision maker or anyone else for operations operating results and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level accordingly we have determined that we have a single reportable segment and operating unit structure recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no revenue from contracts with customers topic asu which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition in august the fasb issued asu no revenue from contracts with customers topic deferral of the effective date which delays the effective date of asu by one year the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date as such the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of we are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in november the fasb issued accounting standards update no income taxes topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet the updated standard is effective for us beginning on january with early application permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified million of our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets as of december this resulted in net adjustments of million increase and million decrease to our noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liability respectively on our december consolidated balance sheet note acquisitions during the year ended december we completed several business acquisitions for total consideration of million primarily related to a business combination involving land and buildings adjacent to our headquarters in menlo park included in this amount is a million promissory note payable issued in connection with this particular acquisition this promissory note payable is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate accordingly pro forma historical results of operations related to these business acquisitions during the year ended december have not been presented we have included the financial results of these business acquisitions in our consolidated financial

estimated useful lives where applicable in millions useful lives in years finite lived intangible assets acquired technology other land acquired other net tangible assets acquired deferred tax assets net net assets acquired goodwill total fair value consideration goodwill generated from all business acquisitions completed during the year ended december is primarily attributable to expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities the amount of goodwill generated during this period that is deductible for tax purposes is not material note earnings per share we compute earnings per share eps of class a and class b common stock using the two class method required for participating securities we consider restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders basic eps is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of our class a and class b common stock outstanding adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase for the calculation of diluted eps net income attributable to common stockholders for basic eps is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities including awards under our equity compensation plans and inducement awards under separate non plan rsu award agreements in addition the computation of the diluted eps of class a common stock assumes the conversion of our class b common stock to class a common stock while the diluted eps of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to class a common stock diluted eps attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding basic and dilutive securities in our basic and diluted eps calculation for the year ended december and do not include contingent earn out shares issuance of these earn out shares is dependent upon the completion of certain milestones these milestones have not been met as of december and accordingly these shares have been excluded from the effect of basic and dilutive securities the rsus excluded from the eps calculation because the impact would be anti dilutive were not material for the years ended december and respectively basic and diluted eps are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted eps computations for our common stock are calculated as follows in millions except per share amounts year ended december class a class b class a class b class a class b basic eps numerator net income less net income attributable to participating securities net income attributable to common stockholders denominator weighted average shares outstanding less shares subject to repurchase number

of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet we early adopted this standard retrospectively and as a result of the reclassifications certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets see note in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information note long term debt in august we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus as well as an annual commitment fee of on the daily undrawn balance of the facility we paid origination fees at closing of the revolving credit facility which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august

to a lesser extent construction of our data center sites the majority of these commitments are due within five years contingencies legal matters beginning on may multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors and or certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other trading related errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings in the u s district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in and the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers on july the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions on december the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec we are also party to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business with respect to our outstanding legal matters we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management s expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected indemnifications in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of services and products we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers directors and certain employees and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in our opinion as of december there was not at least a reasonable possibility we had incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of such parties we have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through december note stockholders equity follow on offering in december we completed a follow on offering in which we issued and sold million shares of class a common stock at a

addition shares available for grant under the stock plan which were reserved but not issued forfeited or repurchased at their original issue price or subject to outstanding awards under the stock plan as of the effective date of our ipo were added to the reserves of the plan and shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of rsus are also added to the reserves of the plan in january we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of rsus in order to cover any required withholding taxes rather than our previous approach of net share settlement the maximum term for stock options granted under the plan may not exceed ten years from the date of grant our plan will terminate ten years from the date of approval unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors or a committee thereof in connection with an acquisition in we granted inducement awards covering an aggregate of million rsus earned over a service period

of december was realized in a future period this would result in a tax benefit of billion within our provision of income taxes at such time on july the united states tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of sharebased compensation expense in an intercompany cost sharing arrangement this opinion concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share share based compensation a final decision was issued by the tax court however this decision may be appealed by the commissioner the impact of the conclusions stated by the tax court in its opinion was not material to our consolidated financial statements we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions the material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the united states and ireland we are under examination by the internal revenue service irs for our through tax years we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations and we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next months related to these years our and future years remain open to examination by the irs our and future years remain open to examination in ireland although the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next months however

directors and performs such additional duties as the board of directors may otherwise determine and delegate generally each regular meeting of our board of directors includes a meeting of our independent directors without management present controlled company status because mr zuckerberg controls a majority of our outstanding voting power we are a controlled company under the corporate governance rules of the nasdaq stock market llc nasdaq therefore we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors has determined not to have an independent nominating function and to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board notwithstanding our status as a controlled company we intend to continue to have a compensation governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors director independence the rules of nasdaq generally require that a majority of the members of a listed company s board of directors be independent in addition the listing rules generally require that subject to specified exceptions each member of a listed company s audit compensation and governance committees be independent although we are a controlled company under the corporate governance rules of nasdaq and therefore are not required to comply with certain rules requiring director independence we have nevertheless opted under our corporate governance guidelines to have a majority of the members of our board of directors be independent and to have a compensation governance committee comprised solely of independent directors audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in rule under the securities exchange act of as amended exchange act in order to be considered independent for purposes of rule a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee the board of directors or any other board committee accept directly or indirectly any consulting advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries our board of directors has determined that none of our non employee directors has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the rules of nasdaq our board of directors has also determined that messrs andreessen and bowles board of directors and dr desmond hellmann who comprise our audit committee and messrs andreessen hastings and thiel who comprise our compensation governance committee satisfy the independence standards for those committees established by applicable sec rules nasdaq rules and applicable rules of the internal revenue code of as amended code classified board so long as the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent a majority of the combined voting power of common stock we will not have a classified board of directors and all directors will be elected for annual terms as of the close of business on april the outstanding shares of class b common stock represented a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock however our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock we will have a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size each serving staggered three year terms at such time our directors will be assigned by the then current board of directors to a class upon expiration of the term of a class of directors directors for that class will be elected for three year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which that term expires as a result only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three year terms each director s term continues until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death resignation or removal in addition when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and we have a classified board only our board of directors may fill vacancies on our board any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that as nearly as possible each class will consist of one third of the total number of directors the classification of our board of directors if implemented may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management board committees our board of directors has established an audit committee and a compensation governance committee each of which have the composition and responsibilities described below members serve on these committees until their resignations or until otherwise determined by our board of directors each of these committees has a written charter current copies of the charters of the audit committee and compensation governance committee are available on our website at http investor fb com governance cfm from time to time the board of directors may also establish ad hoc committees to

and analysis overview this section explains our executive compensation philosophy objectives and design our compensation setting process our executive compensation program components and the decisions made in with respect to the compensation of each of our named executive officers our named executive officers for which consist of the executive officers who appear in summary compensation table below are mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and chief executive officer ceo sheryl k sandberg our chief operating officer coo david m wehner our chief financial officer cfo christopher k cox our chief product officer cpo and mike schroepfer our chief technology officer cto executive compensation philosophy objectives and design philosophy we are focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected we believe that facebook is still in the early stages of this journey and that for us to be successful we must hire and retain people who can continue to develop our strategy quickly innovate and build new products bolster the growth of our user base and user engagement and constantly enhance our business model to achieve these objectives we need a highly talented team comprised of engineering product sales and general and administrative professionals we also expect our executive team to possess and demonstrate strong leadership and management capabilities objectives our compensation programs for our named executive officers are built to support the following objectives attract the top talent in our leadership positions and motivate our executives to deliver the highest level of individual and team impact and results encourage our executives to model the important aspects of our culture which include moving fast being bold communicating openly focusing on impact and building social value in the world ensure each one of our named executive officers receives a total compensation package that encourages his or her longterm retention reward high levels of performance with commensurate levels of compensation and align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders in the overall success of facebook by emphasizing long term incentives design our executive compensation program continues to be heavily weighted towards equity in particular restricted stock units rsus with cash compensation that is generally below market relative to executive compensation at our peer companies we believe that equity compensation offers the best vehicle to focus our executive officers on our mission and the achievement of our long term strategic and financial objectives and to align our executive officers with the long term interests of our stockholders we typically grant our executive officers an annual equity award with service based vesting conditions where the commencement of vesting is deferred until a date some years in the future as discussed further in elements of executive compensation equity compensation below when combined with the executives prior equity awards we believe that these additional grants represent a strong long term retention tool and provide the executive officers with long term equity incentives we evaluate our executive compensation programs including our mix of cash and equity compensation on an annual basis or as circumstances require based on our business objectives and the competitive environment for talent for the near future we anticipate continuing our emphasis on pay for performance and long term incentive compensation for our executive officers while increasing cash compensation in order to move closer to market relative to our peer companies compensation setting process role of our compensation governance committee the compensation governance committee is responsible for overseeing all aspects of our executive compensation programs including executive salaries payouts under our bonus plan the size and structure of equity awards and any executive perquisites the compensation governance committee is solely responsible for determining the compensation of our ceo and reviews and approves compensation of other executive officers the compensation governance committee was formed in june by merging two separate committees of our board of directors the compensation committee and the governance committee the compensation governance committee is the successor to the compensation committee in all respects we will not distinguish between the compensation committee and the compensation governance committee and will refer to the compensation governance committee throughout this document role of management in setting compensation for our ceo our coo and our head of people worked closely with the compensation governance committee in managing our executive compensation program and attended meetings of the compensation governance committee our ceo and coo made recommendations to the compensation governance committee regarding compensation for our executive officers other than for themselves because of their daily involvement with our executive team no executive officer participated directly in the final deliberations or determinations regarding his or her own compensation package except for our ceo who has requested that his base salary continue to be fixed at per year our management team and the compensation governance committee each play a role in evaluating and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans practices and policies for all employees including our named executive officers as further described in compensation risk assessment below role of compensation consultant the compensation governance committee has the authority to engage its own advisors to assist in carrying out its responsibilities in the compensation governance committee engaged the services of compensia inc compensia a national compensation consulting firm to advise the compensation governance committee regarding the amount and types of compensation that we provide to our executives and how our compensation practices compared to the compensation practices of other companies compensia reports directly to the compensation governance committee compensia does not provide any services to us other than the services provided to the compensation governance committee the compensation governance committee believes that compensia does not have any conflicts of interest in advising the compensation governance committee under applicable sec or nasdaq rules use of comparative market data we aim to compensate our executive officers at levels that are commensurate with the most competitive levels of compensation for executives in similar positions at a group of publicly traded peer companies set forth below with whom we compete for hiring and retaining executive talent our peer group the compensation governance committee also considered the scope of responsibility of each executive officer our current practice of maintaining minimal differentiation between the cash packages of our executive officers the unvested balances of equity awards for each executive officer as well as the compensation governance committee s assessment of each executive officer s performance and impact on the organization in determining compensation we did not use a formula for taking into account these different factors we analyze market data for executive compensation at least annually using the most relevant published survey sources public filings and input from compensia management and compensia provided the compensation governance committee with both cash and equity compensation data for our peer group which was selected from companies that meet some or all of the criteria listed below high technology or media company key talent competitor minimum revenue of billion and or minimum market capitalization of billion using this criteria as a baseline the compensation governance committee approved the following companies for inclusion in our compensation peer group for adobe microsoft alphabet netflix amazon com qualcomm apple salesforce com cisco systems sap ebay the walt disney company emc twitter linkedin vmware yahoo in the fourth quarter of our compensation governance committee reviewed our executive compensation against this peer group to ensure that our executive officer compensation was competitive and sufficient to recruit and retain our executive officers compensia provided the compensation governance committee with total cash compensation data base salaries and cash bonus awards at target and total compensation data total cash compensation and equity compensation at various percentiles while the compensation governance committee considered this data in determining executive officer compensation we did not seek to benchmark our executive compensation to any particular level the total compensation for our named executive officers was not determined based on any pre set target percentile of market rather we sought to compensate our executive officers at a level that would allow us to successfully recruit and retain the best possible talent for our executive team we relied heavily on the knowledge and experience of the compensation governance committee and our management in determining the appropriate compensation levels for our executive officers overall based on compensia s analysis of our peer group target total cash compensation for our executive officers was below the percentile of our peers when equity compensation was factored in without taking into account the effect of the deferred vesting start dates that are applicable to the equity compensation of our executive officers total compensation for our named executive officers other than our ceo fell between the and percentile relative to the companies in the peer group in the second quarter of the compensation governance committee reviewed the selection criteria and the companies in the peer group following that review the compensation governance committee decided not to make any changes to the composition of the peer group accordingly we plan to use the following list of companies in our peer group for the executive compensation process adobe microsoft alphabet netflix amazon com qualcomm apple salesforce com cisco systems sap ebay the walt disney company emc twitter linkedin vmware yahoo the compensation governance committee expects to periodically review and update this peer group and the underlying criteria as our business and market environment continue to evolve elements of executive compensation our executive officer compensation packages generally include base salary performance based cash incentives and equity based compensation in the form of rsus we believe that our compensation mix supports our objective of focusing on at risk compensation having significant financial upside based on company and individual performance we expect to continue to emphasize equity awards because of the direct link that equity compensation provides between stockholder interests and the interests of our executive officers thereby motivating our executive officers to focus on increasing our value over the long term base salary the compensation governance committee believes base salaries are a necessary element of compensation in order to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers the compensation governance committee reviews base salaries for our executive officers at least annually and may adjust them from time to time if needed to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors historically our executive officers have received base salaries within a very narrow range that was established when we were a smaller company with cash constraints and based on our desire to maintain internal pay equity between executive officers and also relative to other key employees as we have grown we have increased base salaries for our executive officers other than our ceo with the goal of bringing salaries closer to market over time in the first quarter of the compensation governance committee decided to increase the base salaries of our executive officers other than our ceo in order to continue to bring their salaries closer to those paid by our peer group companies for similar positions accordingly our compensation governance committee increased the base salary of ms sandberg by and messrs wehner cox and schroepfer by following these salary increases as noted above these executive officer salaries fell between the and percentile of the salaries provided by our peer group companies for executives in similar positions mr zuckerberg has previously requested to receive a base salary of per year named executive officer base salary mark zuckerberg sheryl k sandberg david m wehner christopher k cox mike schroepfer cash bonuses our bonus plan bonus plan provides variable cash incentives payable semi annually that are designed to motivate our executive officers to focus on company wide priorities and to reward them for individual results and achievements in the individual target bonus percentage for each named executive officer was unchanged from at of such executive s base salary after the base salary increases noted above target total cash compensation base salary plus target bonus for executive officers other than our ceo was at approximately the percentile of our peer group companies for executives in similar positions all of our executive officers except our ceo participated in the bonus plan in for there were two six month performance periods under our bonus plan which we refer to as first half and second half for each performance period in the compensation governance committee approved a set of companywide priorities in order to focus our executive officers on key areas of performance for the period in question the first half and second half company priorities reflect operational and non operational objectives established by our compensation governance committee in consultation with our ceo and cfo the company wide priorities do not have specific targets associated with them for purposes of determining performance under the bonus plan and our compensation governance committee has complete discretion to determine the level of bonus payout for each performance period priorities and company performance percentage our first half company wide priorities were as follows grow our user base across all our products increase sharing and engagement continue to achieve revenue growth and significant savings from efficiency improve product quality improve our brand and make progress toward our long term investments none of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the total bonus the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the company performance percentage on a qualitative basis taking into account our delivery of results in the areas identified by the company wide priorities approved by the compensation governance committee as well as our overall business engineering and product development achievements the compensation governance committee also did not determine any pre set ranges for the company performance percentage the first half company performance percentage approved by the compensation governance committee was the compensation governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company wide priorities our second half company wide priorities were as follows grow our user base across all of our products increase sharing engagement and utility continue to achieve revenue growth and significant savings from efficiency improve product quality improve our brand and make progress toward our long term investments none of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the total bonus the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the company performance percentage on a qualitative basis taking into account our delivery of results in the areas identified by the companywide priorities approved by the compensation governance committee as well as our overall business engineering and product development achievements the compensation governance committee also did not determine any pre set ranges for the company performance percentage the second half company performance percentage approved by the compensation governance committee was the compensation governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company wide priorities particularly the strength of our user growth and engagement and our continued strong revenue growth bonus plan payouts we calculate bonus plan payouts to each participant using the following formula base eligible earnings x individual bonus target percentage x individual performance percentage x company performance percentage individual bonus payout individual performance percentage the individual performance percentage is based upon each executive s individual performance assessment for the performance period under consideration in line with our pay for performance philosophy a higher performance assessment drives a higher individual percentage and vice versa such that it is possible for an executive with a low assessment to get less than their target bonus payout or no bonus payout whatsoever in potential individual performance percentages under our bonus plan were or an executive meeting our expected high level of performance expectations would receive an individual performance percentage of individual performance assessments for each executive officer were determined at the discretion of the compensation governance committee in close consultation with our ceo and our coo except in each case when their own performance assessment was being determined the performance assessment determinations were based on an overall subjective assessment of each officer s performance and no single factor was determinative in setting bonus levels nor was the impact of any individual factor on the bonus quantifiable we operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and we set a high bar for performance expectations for each one of our executive officers the compensation governance committee evaluates our executive officers based on their overall performance impact and results as well as their demonstration of strong leadership long term vision effective execution and management capabilities first half and second half payout levels and achievements and considerations for each executive were as follows mark zuckerberg mr zuckerberg did not participate in the bonus plan in although mr zuckerberg did not participate in the bonus plan the compensation governance committee separately assessed his performance as our ceo sheryl k sandberg ms sandberg received for the first half bonus which reflected her overall leadership and execution on business priorities her contribution to growing revenue including the continued growth in mobile ad revenue and her leadership in key policy matters ms sandberg received for the second half bonus which reflected her role in growing our revenue year over year her strategic guidance in various business matters and the strong growth in the number of advertisers on our platform david m wehner mr wehner received for the first half bonus which reflected his overall leadership of our finance organization and in particular driving long range planning for the company mr wehner received for the second half bonus which reflected his effective communication with our investors strategic facilities planning for our growing workforce and his contributions to the strong financial performance of the company as well as the overall performance of the finance function christopher k cox mr cox received for the first half bonus which reflected his overall leadership of the product organization improvements in the quality of news feed and his contributions to increases in user growth and engagement mr cox received for the second half bonus which reflected his leadership and innovations in the areas of product design and engagement such as reactions progress in our brand efforts and continued growth in time spent with our products mike schroepfer mr schroepfer received for the first half bonus which reflected his leadership and execution on our engineering priorities recruitment of engineering leadership talent and the continued development of a sustainable and cost effective engineering infrastructure mr schroepfer received for the second half bonus which reflected his strong leadership of the engineering team successful launch of gear vr and continued progress on other long term investments the following table summarizes the calculations that were used in determining the cash bonus paid to each of our named executive officers performance period base eligible earnings individual bonus percentage target bonus individual performance percentage company performance percentage individual bonus payout sheryl k sandberg first half second half total david m wehner first half second half total christopher k cox first half second half total mike schroepfer first half second half total reflects actual earnings for which may differ from approved base salaries due to the effective dates of salary increases and the number of pay dates in the calendar year equity compensation most of our executive officers compensation is delivered through equity awards we use equity compensation to align our executive officers financial interests with those of our stockholders to attract industry leaders of the highest caliber and to retain them for the long term in addition to the initial equity grant that each executive receives as part of his or her new hire package the compensation governance committee typically grants our executives additional equity awards each year as part of our company wide equity refresher program additional equity grants for each of our executive officers are determined on a discretionary basis taking into account the following factors delivering equity values that are highly competitive when compared against those our peer group would grant to executives with similar responsibility each executive officer s individual performance assessment the results and contributions delivered during the year as well as the anticipated potential future impact of each individual executive the size and vesting schedule of existing equity grants in order to maximize the long term retentive power of all additional grants and the size of each executive officer s total cash compensation base salary plus cash bonus awards at target which is generally lower than the cash compensation for executives with similar responsibilities at our peer group based on the foregoing factors in our compensation governance committee awarded each of our executive officers other than our ceo a grant of rsus with a specific initial equity value based on an estimated total value for each grant before taking into account the deferred vesting considerations described below the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the specific individual equity values vesting schedules and vesting start dates based on these qualitative decisions the compensation governance committee then calculated the number of rsus to be granted by dividing this initial equity value by per share which was the average closing price for the seven trading days following the announcement of our earnings for the fourth quarter of and the same price that was used for refresher grants to all other employees vesting of rsu grants due to our desire to provide incentives for our executive officers to focus on long term strategic and financial objectives the compensation governance committee deferred the vesting start dates of all rsu grants made to our executive officers other than our cfo to a future date determined individually for each executive as a result the rsu grants generally will not begin to vest unless the recipient remains continuously employed by us through future dates as described in the following paragraphs and in grants of plan based awards table below the compensation governance committee reviewed the size and vesting schedule for the remaining unvested portion of the outstanding equity award holdings of each of our executive officers and agreed with the recommendation of our ceo and coo except that our coo did not participate in discussions regarding her own equity compensation that the existing equity awards appropriately satisfied our retention and incentive goals for the immediate future for each of our executive officers accordingly the additional equity awards granted to our executive officers in other than our cfo start vesting only after a significant portion of each executive s outstanding equity awards have vested the compensation governance committee believes that these deferred vesting schedules make the equity awards more valuable to us in retaining our executive officers and reflect our emphasis on our long term success in the case of our cfo the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate not to defer the vesting start date for mr wehner s rsu grant in order to increase his total compensation to a level appropriate for his new role as cfo typically the rsu grants for our executive officers vest over four years following the vesting start date the compensation and governance committee determined that it was appropriate to shorten the vesting schedule for ms sandberg and lengthen the vesting for mr wehner based on individual circumstances described below for more information relating to the vesting schedules of these rsu grants see grants of plan based awards table below equity grants mr zuckerberg did not receive any additional equity grants in because our compensation governance committee believed that his existing equity ownership position sufficiently aligns his interests with those of our stockholders our other named executive officers received the following rsu grants in sheryl k sandberg ms sandberg received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to three year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of november the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate for this rsu grant to vest over three years in order to deliver competitive compensation in future years david m wehner mr wehner received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to five year vesting with a one year cliff based on continued employment from and after a vesting start date of february such that one fifth of the shares shall vest on february and the remainder of the shares shall vest quarterly thereafter the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate for this rsu grant to vest over five years to increase the retentive power of this grant christopher k cox mr cox received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to four year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of february mike schroepfer mr schroepfer received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to four year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of february following the grants of these equity awards the total compensation for our named executive officers other than our ceo was between the and percentiles relative to the companies in our peer group compensation governance the compensation governance committee seeks to ensure sound executive compensation practices to adhere to our payfor performance philosophy while appropriately managing risk and aligning our compensation programs with long term stockholder interests the following practices were in effect during the compensation governance committee is comprised solely of independent directors the compensation governance committee conducts an annual review and approval of our compensation strategy with assistance from its independent compensation consultant compensia including a review of our compensation related risk profile to ensure that our compensation related risks are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company the compensation governance committee retains discretion on bonus payouts to enable it to respond to unforeseen events and adjust bonus payouts as appropriate we do not offer post employment benefits and our compensation philosophy and related governance features are complemented by several specific practices that are designed to align our executive compensation with long term stockholder interests including the following our executives are subject to company wide policies that prohibit hedging activities the pledging of our securities as collateral for loans and the shorting of our securities we offer limited perquisites that are for business related purposes or necessary for the security of our ceo and coo and our executives participate in broad based company sponsored health and welfare benefits programs on the same basis as our other full time salaried employees perquisites and other benefits consistent with the practices of many companies in our peer group we provide certain perquisites to our named executive officers for the reasons described below because of the high visibility of our company our compensation governance committee has authorized an overall security program for mr zuckerberg to address safety concerns due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder chairman and ceo we require these security measures for the company s benefit because of the importance of mr zuckerberg to facebook and we believe that the costs of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary we paid for the initial procurement installation and maintenance of security measures for mr zuckerberg s personal residences and we pay for the annual costs of security personnel in addition mr zuckerberg uses private aircraft for personal travel in connection with his overall security program on certain occasions mr zuckerberg may be accompanied by guests when using private aircraft although we do not consider mr zuckerberg s overall security program to be a perquisite for his benefit for the reasons described above the costs related to personal security for mr zuckerberg at his residence and during personal travel as well as the costs of private aircraft for personal travel pursuant to mr zuckerberg s overall security program are reported as other compensation to mr zuckerberg in the all other compensation column in summary compensation table below our compensation governance committee has also authorized a security program for ms sandberg including certain personal security measures to address safety concerns resulting from her position as our coo we require these security measures for the company s benefit because of the importance of ms sandberg to facebook and we believe the costs are appropriate and necessary the costs related to personal security for ms sandberg are reported as other compensation to ms sandberg in the all other compensation column in summary compensation table below say on pay vote we held a non binding advisory stockholder vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers commonly referred to as a say on pay vote at our annual meeting of stockholders over of the voting power of shares voted at the annual meeting of stockholders were cast in favor of our say on pay proposal our then compensation committee considered the result of this advisory vote to be an endorsement of our compensation program policies practices and philosophy for our named executive officers our compensation governance committee has considered and will continue to consider the outcome of our say on pay votes and our stockholder views when making compensation decisions for our named executive officers based on the results of a separate non binding advisory stockholder vote on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding the compensation program of our named executive officers commonly referred to as a say on frequency vote held at our annual meeting of stockholders our board of directors determined that we will hold our say on pay vote every three years until the next required say on frequency vote which will occur no later than we value the opinions of our stockholders and will continue to consider the outcome of future say on pay votes when we make compensation decisions for the members of our executive team including the named executive officers the next say on pay vote will take place at our annual meeting of stockholders m tax deductibility section m of the internal revenue code of as amended code limits the amount that we may deduct from our federal income taxes for remuneration paid to our named executive officers other than our cfo to million dollars per executive officer per year unless certain requirements are met section m provides an exception from this deduction limitation for certain forms of performance based compensation as well as for the gain recognized by covered executive officers upon the exercise of qualifying compensatory stock options in addition grandfather provisions may apply to certain compensation arrangements that were entered into by a corporation before it was publicly held and through april while our compensation governance committee is mindful of the benefit to us of the full deductibility of compensation our compensation governance committee believes that it should not be constrained by the requirements of section m where those requirements would impair flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives therefore our compensation governance committee has not adopted a policy that requires that all compensation be deductible and accordingly gain recognized from rsus granted after april may be non deductible our compensation governance committee intends to continue to compensate our executive officers in a manner consistent with the best interests of our company and our stockholders in addition because of the fact based nature of the performance based compensation exception under section m and the limited availability of formal guidance thereunder we cannot guarantee that any compensation arrangements intended to qualify for exemption under section m will actually receive this treatment compensation risk assessment our management team and the compensation governance committee each play a role in evaluating and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans practices and policies for all employees including our named executive officers in early compensia the compensation governance committee s independent compensation consultant performed an assessment in conjunction with management of our compensation plans and practices and concluded that our compensation program does not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company the compensation governance committee has reviewed this report and agreed with the conclusion the objective of the assessment was to identify any compensation plans or practices that may encourage employees to take unnecessary risk that could threaten the company no such plans or practices were identified the risk assessment process included among other things a review of our cash and equity incentivebased compensation plans to ensure that they are aligned with our company performance goals and the overall compensation to ensure an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay components and

connection with a termination or a change in control limitations on liability and indemnification matters our restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law consequently our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors except liability for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in section of the delaware general corporation law or any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify our directors executive officers and other key employees made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she serves or served in such capacity at our request to the

arising out of their services as one of our directors or executive officers or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request including liability arising out of negligence or active or passive wrongdoing by the officer or director we believe that these charter provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons such as directors officers and key employees we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty they may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers even though an action if successful might benefit us and other stockholders further a stockholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of as amended securities act may be permitted to directors executive officers or persons controlling us we have been informed that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable rule sales plans certain of our directors and executive officers have adopted

compensation benefits employee benefits employee benefits are optional non wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their normal wages or salaries these types of benefits may include group insurance health dental vision life etc disability income protection retirement benefits daycare tuition reimbursement sick leave vacation paid and non paid funding of education as well as flexible and alternative work arrangements in this section the benefits of benefits plan the basics health dental life ad d long term disability employee assistance plans eaps retirement benefits indirect non financial compensation the benefits of benefits plans although expensive there are many intrinsic benefits to providing your employees with a comprehensive benefit plan for most it is the ability to find and keep highly qualified staff that is the key driver with the sector being highly competitive and the number of new employees entering the workforce dwindling employers are challenged to become even more creative and responsive in the design timing and generosity of their benefit plans the more progressive the organization the more flexible the structure is in response to today s challenges i e like having four different generations of employees working side by side employers who continue to provide the more traditional and limited program may find it more difficult to find and keep different types of employees here are just a few of the advantages of offering benefits to your employees for employers by providing increased access and flexibility in employee benefits employers can not only recruit but retain qualified employees providing benefits to employees is seen as managing high risk coverage at low costs and easing the company s financial burden employee benefits have been proven to improve productivity because employees are more effective with they are assured of security for themselves and their families premiums are tax deductible as corporation expense which means savings for the organization for employees employees can experience a peace of mind which leads to increased productivity and satisfaction by being assured that they are their families are protected in any mishap employees with personal life and disability insurance can enjoy additional protection including income replacement in the event of serious illness or disability employees can feel a sense of pride in their employer if they are satisfied with the coverage they receive back to top the basics health dental health and dental benefits are considered the foundation of any benefit program design when considering the root issues of all absenteeism from the workplace most employers agree that health or dental related illness is cited most as the cause while many have not thought of dental coverage as being a key attraction point a number of medical reports have been published recently that indicate that many of our common virus and illnesses are actually related to poor dental health an organization s ability to be creative flexible and generous in providing health and dental coverage can be a key to attracting and retaining top performers as part of the total compensation package health even in canada where government plans provide approximately of all healthcare expenses the remaining gap is still perceived as a major concern for employees and employers private healthcare plans are restricted by legislation to expenses not fully covered by government programs organizational health expense plans are generally permitted in the following areas across canada hospital room charges in excess of the standard rate to cover semi private or private accommodation hospital charges for emergency treatment outside canada drugs medication and vaccines and other supplies available only by prescription professional services of a physician for out of country medical expenses professional services for private duty nursing charges for special medical appliances such as crutches artificial limbs or wheelchairs non emergency ambulance services dental treatments not requiring hospitalization professional services provided by licensed paramedicals such as psychologists massage therapists speech therapists podiatrists physiotherapists chiropractors osteopaths or naturopaths vision care expenses including frames and lenses contact lenses fitting and remedial treatment laser eye correction surgery this option is one that many employers struggle to provide their employees with as the number requiring vision care is so great the cost of including this option could raise the employer s costs by anywhere from to it is common practice to include many of the above items under a single extended healthcare plan most benefit carriers will tailor a plan to include only those features and coverage s desired certain items however are often restricted or sold in combination with other coverage s to contain overall plan costs or to subsidize heavily utilized services extended healthcare plan options should be selected based on the organization s overall compensation objectives and employee needs for small organizations the range of coverage options may be limited if the plans are financed on a fully insured basis these plans offer restricted flexibility to limit the occurrence of high risk claims these pre packaged plans are available to small organizations through affiliation with umbrella organizations such as chambers of commerce boards of trade trade associations and professional organizations for larger organizations the range of options is mostly limited by cost considerations dental dental plan design is the art of finding a delicate balance between understanding what the foundational priorities are and allocating sufficient funds to ensure that the coverage is perceived as being sufficient and appropriate although the type of dental work can differ from person to person some common elements have been found most employees their spouses and children require basic preventative dental care and repair therefore most employers elect to design the plan in such a way as to minimize the cost to employees of basic coverage since major restorative care and orthodontics tend to be more elective in nature and less common in need across the employee group than basic services most plans do not provide equal coverage in all areas for example the plan might pay of basic and of the other two categories it is also common to find deductibles co insurance and benefit maximums for the non basic services to free up more funds for the necessary preventive ones high employee deductibles and co insurance percentages can help to limit plan disbursements because employees will be paying more of the total costs the potential problem is that these high employee costs may in effect force postponement of needed dental work until the repair bill is even higher paying of basic preventative care from day one is the overwhelming choice of employers having the dental plan require a pre treatment evaluation for certain expenses helps control cost levels by ensuring that the plan only pays for reasonable treatments it also avoids any misunderstanding by the employee as to what services are covered and how much he or she is required to pay it is always preferable to ensure the employee knows what the plan will pay for and what exact dollar amount is their responsibility a commonly asked question of benefit administrators is why the dental plan is not optional but compulsory if the plan is optional only those employees who are likely to need dental care will sign up they will almost always use services that exceed their contributions deductibles and co insurance those who feel that the benefits will not cover their costs will decline because of this adverse selection cost per employee will be so high that employers would not be perceived as competitive back to top life and ad d most employers design their plans with a provision to protect the employee and or their family in the event of accidental death or dismemberment ad d employers often provide basic coverage as a factor of the employee s salary example the employee s salary in the event of death or total paralysis with additional coverage available should the employee chose to purchase it each employee benefit plan should include a chart that identifies what coverage is available and the associated cost back to top long term disability long term disability is an income replacement provision this is one provision that cannot be purchased through a spousal plan employees are asked to pay the total cost of the premiums in order to receive a tax free payment should they be unable to work long term disability coverage is applied for when an employee is unable to complete a certain percentage of the essential duties of their role due to illness on an ongoing basis the structure of each plan can differ slightly so understanding what you are trying to achieve with this program including elimination periods and termination options is critical at the outset employee assistance plans eaps an eap or employee assistance program is a confidential short term counseling service for employees with personal problems that affect their work performance studies have shown that providing confidential qualified counseling and support can reduce the stress and conflict felt by the employee which in turn can reduce absenteeism and ultimately turnover one on one sessions are offered and online information coaching and support services are also available employees turn to the eap for help with a variety of issues including the following dependent care issues such as searching for child care information identifying services for special needs children obtaining advice on the college application process or arranging for residential care for an elder dealing with the stress of a major life change even a positive one such as having or adopting a child getting married moving or buying a home or getting a promotion serious personal or professional concerns such as general anxiety depression substance abuse burnout coping with illness the loss of a loved one relationship challenges or resolving interpersonal conflicts different types of programs are available to employers to provide employee assistance employers can establish their own in house programs join a consortium of organizations to provide external services or refer employees to public and private providers of this service the range of costs across these options can vary widely organizations must then decide the most advantageous approach to achieve the level of improved wellness among their employees in selecting the best eap provider several factors need to be considered how accessible and convenient are the services to be provided location of offices and confidentially concerns are important here how is the quality of services to be measured how is client satisfaction to be assessed how are service costs to be determined and will there be limits placed on the frequency and extent of services provided what will the charges be per hour of service per individual before choosing an eap provider these questions need to be answered and the answers reflected in any service proposal or contract back to top retirement benefits a retirement plan or a pension is an arrangement by an employer to provide their employees with an income when they are no longer earning a regular income from working retirement plans may be set up by in a variety of ways but typically will have a form of a guaranteed payment often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money into a fund while employed so that they will receive benefits upon retirement pension plans are considered a form of delayed income pension plans pension plans are usually classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the payments are determined a defined benefit plan guarantees a predictable monthly payment at retirement calculated by using an established formula with some combination of the employee s salary years of service and or age a defined contribution plan will provide a payment payout at retirement that will be determined by the amount of money contributed during the life of the plan and the performance of the stock or investments used registered retirement savings plans a registered retirement savings plan or rrsp is an account that provides tax benefits for saving for retirement yet is not necessarily based on the employer employee relationship rrsps can provide ways to save money for retirement and defer and reduce taxes because contributions to rrsps up to established limits may be deducted from income in pre taxed dollars income earned within the account is not taxed until money is withdrawn from the plan rrsp accounts can be setup with as either individual rrsp an individual rrsp is associated with only a single individual only they contribute money to their rrsp spousal rrsp the spouse of the contributor is actually the account holder a spousal rrsp is a means of splitting income in retirement group rrsp an employer can arrange for employees to make contributions through a schedule of regular payroll deductions in many organizations rrsp contributions can be based on a matching program this means that the employer will put in a certain percentage or dollar amount based on the contributions the employee makes the employee gets to receive the tax savings immediately at the time of deduction instead of having to wait until the end of the tax year phased retirement today s work place is challenged with having up to four different generations working side by side for most employers designing a compensation and benefit structure that address the unique needs of each demographic group is a complex task added to that is the shift in pension structures over the past few years some non profit organizations provide their employees with a pension fund however most tend to offer only contributions to an rrsp this leads to an increasing number of employees not feeling able to retire it is important that organizations understand the details of their pension plan whether it is a defined benefit or contribution or simply an rrsp program before considering design changes for those not hindered by a design change one option that is gaining in popularity especially in this sector is providing a phased retirement program for older skilled employees for employees components of the phased program are allowing employees who might be considering retiring to delay their departure date continue to earn a partial income that reduces the burden on their pension income they continue to receive benefit coverage and are able to acclimate gradually by continuing to reduce their hours until they are prepared to leave for employers employers are able to develop a timely and effective succession plan without losing critical skills or intellectual capital organizations benefit by being able to tap into the most experienced staff at a reduced salary while transitioning to a new team or organizational design hurdles employees need to understand the impact continuing to work may have on pension or benefit programs also to be considered is the timing of starting your phased approach if an employee starts too soon they might not have accumulated enough to compensate for the reduced salary employers need to be sure that the phased retirement program is structured in a way that will not diminish the work of the organization or the financial position of the employee back to top indirect non financial compensation indirect compensation will look different in every organization ultimately it is the way in which you choose to define the culture of your organization and your total compensation rewards program that will differentiate it of course it is important to ensure it aligns with organizational strategic objectives recent studies all indicate that in today s changing work environment it is the flexibility and creativity that draws and keeps the highly skilled employee benefit perspective from a benefit perspective being creative and considering ways to improve the access or quality of your benefits could look like allowing employees to access their benefit as of their hire date being able to accumulate sick days to bridge to disability coverage being able to use some sick days as personal health days to allow employees to have a break without using all their holidays or pretending to be sick receiving your birthday off with pay eliminating the probationary period language from contracts offer letters seeking insurance providers with vision care benefits at reasonable costs allowing for some increased flexibility in personalizing benefit options i e health spending accounts vision care versus dental and more paramedical coverage although these options have a cost associated with them the cost is significantly less than the benefit an organization can reap in return if your insurance provider does not allow you the freedom to make some adjustments in your plan then it might be time to research what else is available other perspectives many articles have been written highlighting the keys to creating the best organization and to finding and keeping the best employees in recent studies the following were identified as key factors compensation paying employees fairly against both the market conditions as well as ensuring internal equity was still the number one factor considered providing clear information on the organization s compensation structure and consistent processes were critical to an employee s sense of commitment professional development for many people especially the younger generations the ability to develop both personally and professionally was highly valued and a key consideration deciding where to work access to training and development on the job and through courses or conferences were listed in a study done by the conference board of canada as important another variation of this was receiving reimbursement for courses taken on the employee s own time most commonly reimbursed were courses that aligned with a professional designation in the employees current role culture employees who were surveyed and asked what kept them in their current role indicated that having a culture that recognized the importance of connecting performance to rewards were key to their satisfaction performance management was one component that influenced the culture having clearly defined expectations being able to identify goals to work towards and having their evaluation align with those agreed to goals contributed to higher satisfaction levels receiving effective and realistic feedback both positive and constructive increased a continuous learning environment and increases commitment to the organization because performance both good and bad is recognized succession planning when operating within an organization brings a sense of purpose and sustainability to employees confidence in the future and their role it in was reported consistently by those who had been identified for a succession plan consider ways to develop younger staff with great potential by having them be identified as a potential successor to a long term employee the employee wins by learning new and critical skills while feeling rewarded for their hard work to date the more senior person feels rewarded for years of service and identified as a key contributor the organization wins by ensuring that intellectual capital is not lost but transitioned from one employee to another trust demonstrated as part of the culture of an organization is highly valued by all generations of employees in steven covey s book moving at the speed of trust leaders are challenged to evaluate if their organization s culture is one of trust or mistrust employees who feel trusted and respected will strive harder to maintain that trust and are less likely to do something that will result in a loss of trust workplace flexibility alternative work arrangements are effective ways to negotiate an arrangement that meet the needs of the organization while also providing employees will what they need to balance their home and work environments listed below are just some of the ideas that could be explored finding out what your organization would value can start this process the key is to ensure that any alternative arrangements considered do not hinder the organization s ability to ensure that core work is being completed in the time and manner required to maintain sustainability having clear expectations on both the organization and the employee s part as to the terms and conditions of the alternative work arrangement can prevent ineffective or damaging results flexible time this can be establishing core hours then allowing employees to work earlier in the day or later in the day example core hours are to person a starts at and works till person b works from to seasonal hours can be established in a variety of terms just as flexible hours schedule of part time employees example hiring a part time person to work days a week or a but they actually work full time for months a year and then take a combination of their time vacation and hours and take a month in the summer and a month in the winter off work they would continue to receive the salary for months a year compressed work week allowing an employee to work their full number of hours in less days example core hours are hours per week the employee works hours days instead of hour days job sharing having qualified employees share the duties and tasks of one position both could work days or alternative between days one week and the next the advantage of job sharing is having people who both know the role the downside can be having a communication gap between individuals doing the role consider having an employee who is contemplating retirement job share with a more junior employee with high potential transition knowledge skills and commitment telecommuting this is the practice of allowing an employee work from their home location instead of on your premises there are guidelines governing the considerations for this type of employment in the past ten years the number of people telecommuting has tripled with results indicating that increased productivity and effectiveness were seen from this type of working arrangement regular part time work many people today are looking for meaningful work but on a part time basis a desire to balance work and life priorities has increased exponentially over the past decade and employers who recognize the contribution part time employees can make are leading their organizations forward educational partnership many employees are looking for opportunities to balance academic pursuits with employment opportunities considering how you could structure a role for a person in the final stages of their education could result in an increased pool of potential employees and employees who will be loyal to an organization that provided with them practical experience and the ability to create a flexible schedule regardless of whether you are developing an alternative work arrangement or increasing the flexibility of your benefit program it is important to understand what motivates employees and what culture you are building in your organization the better able you are to align the two together the increased success you will have

the european commission has concluded that ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to billion to apple this is illegal under eu state aid rules because it allowed apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses ireland must now recover the illegal aid commissioner margrethe vestager in charge of competition policy said member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies this is illegal under eu state aid rules the commission s investigation concluded that ireland granted illegal tax benefits to apple which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years in fact this selective treatment allowed apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of per cent on its european profits in down to per cent in following an in depth state aid investigation launched in june the european commission has concluded that two tax rulings issued by ireland to apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by apple in ireland since the rulings endorsed a way to establish the taxable profits for two irish incorporated companies of the apple group apple sales international and apple operations europe which did not correspond to economic reality almost all sales profits recorded by the two companies were internally attributed to a head office the commission s assessment showed that these head offices existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits these profits allocated to the head offices were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the irish tax law which are no longer in force as a result of the allocation method endorsed in the tax rulings apple only paid an effective corporate tax rate that declined from in to in on the profits of apple sales international this selective tax treatment of apple in ireland is illegal under eu state aid rules because it gives apple a significant advantage over other businesses that are subject to the same national taxation rules the commission can order recovery of illegal state aid for a ten year period preceding the commission s first request for information in ireland must now recover the unpaid taxes in ireland from apple for the years to of up to billion plus interest in fact the tax treatment in ireland enabled apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of apple products in the entire eu single market this is due to apple s decision to record all sales in ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold this structure is however outside the remit of eu state aid control if other countries were to require apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules this would reduce the amount to be recovered by ireland apple s tax structure in europe apple sales international and apple operations europe are two irish incorporated companies that are fully owned by the apple group ultimately controlled by the us parent apple inc they hold the rights to use apple s intellectual property to sell and manufacture apple products outside north and south america under a so called cost sharing agreement with apple inc under this agreement apple sales international and apple operations europe make yearly payments to apple in the us to fund research and development efforts conducted on behalf of the irish companies in the us these payments amounted to about us billion in and significantly increased in these expenses mainly borne by apple sales international contributed to fund more than half of all research efforts by the apple group in the us to develop its intellectual property worldwide these expenses are deducted from the profits recorded by apple sales international and apple operations europe in ireland each year in line with applicable rules the taxable profits of apple sales international and apple operations europe in ireland are determined by a tax ruling granted by ireland in which in was replaced by a similar second tax ruling this tax ruling was terminated when apple sales international and apple operations europe changed their structures in apple sales internationalapple sales international is responsible for buying apple products from equipment manufacturers around the world and selling these products in europe as well as in the middle east africa and india apple set up their sales operations in europe in such a way that customers were contractually buying products from apple sales international in ireland rather than from the shops that physically sold the products to customers in this way apple recorded all sales and the profits stemming from these sales directly in ireland the two tax rulings issued by ireland concerned the internal allocation of these profits within apple sales international rather than the wider set up of apple s sales operations in europe specifically they endorsed a split of the profits for tax purposes in ireland under the agreed method most profits were internally allocated away from ireland to a head office within apple sales international this head office was not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings only a fraction of the profits of apple sales international were allocated to its irish branch and subject to tax in ireland the remaining vast majority of profits were allocated to the head office where they remained untaxed therefore only a small percentage of apple sales international s profits were taxed in ireland and the rest was taxed nowhere in for example according to figures released at us senate public hearings apple sales international recorded profits of us billion c a billion but under the terms of the tax ruling only around million were considered taxable in ireland leaving billion of profits untaxed as a result apple sales international paid less than million of corporate tax in ireland in an effective tax rate of about on its overall annual profits in subsequent years apple sales international s recorded profits continued to increase but the profits considered taxable in ireland under the terms of the tax ruling did not thus this effective tax rate decreased further to only in apple operations europeon the basis of the same two tax rulings from and apple operations europe benefitted from a similar tax arrangement over the same period of time the company was responsible for manufacturing certain lines of computers for the apple group the majority of the profits of this company were also allocated internally to its head office and not taxed anywhere commission assessmenttax rulings as such are perfectly legal they are comfort letters issued by tax authorities to give a company clarity on how its corporate tax will be calculated or on the use of special tax provisions the role of eu state aid control is to ensure member states do not give selected companies a better tax treatment than others via tax rulings or otherwise more specifically profits must be allocated between companies in a corporate group and between different parts of the same company in a way that reflects economic reality this means that the allocation should be in line with arrangements that take place under commercial conditions between independent businesses so called arm s length principle in particular the commission s state aid investigation concerned two consecutive tax rulings issued by ireland which endorsed a method to internally allocate profits within apple sales international and apple operations europe two irish incorporated companies it assessed whether this endorsed method to calculate the taxable profits of each company in ireland gave apple an undue advantage that is illegal under eu state aid rules the commission s investigation has shown that the tax rulings issued by ireland endorsed an artificial internal allocation of profits within apple sales international and apple operations europe which has no factual or economic justification as a result of the tax rulings most sales profits of apple sales international were allocated to its head office when this head office had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business or any other substantive business for that matter only the irish branch of apple sales international had the capacity to generate any income from trading i e from the distribution of apple products therefore the sales profits of apple sales international should have been recorded with the irish branch and taxed there the head office did not have any employees or own premises the only activities that can be associated with the head offices are limited decisions taken by its directors many of which were at the same time working full time as executives for apple inc on the distribution of dividends administrative arrangements and cash management these activities generated profits in terms of interest that based on the commission s assessment are the only profits which can be attributed to the head offices similarly only the irish branch of apple operations europe had the capacity to generate any income from trading i e from the production of certain lines of computers for the apple group therefore sales profits of apple operation europe should have been recorded with the irish branch and taxed there on this basis the commission concluded that the tax rulings issued by ireland endorsed an artificial allocation of apple sales international and apple operations europe s sales profits to their head offices where they were not taxed as a result the tax rulings enabled apple to pay substantially less tax than other companies which is illegal under eu state aid rules this decision does not call into question ireland s general tax system or its corporate tax rate

such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while user provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varies by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the user s ip address and self disclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the user s actual location for example a mobile only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user s actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses the numbers of daus mobile daus maus mobile maus mobile only daus and mobile only maus discussed in this annual report on form k as well as arpu do not include users of instagram or whatsapp

including on facebook instagram and third party applications and websites competition our business is characterized by innovation rapid change and disruptive technologies we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communications and the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for application developers we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our products to attract and retain marketers and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products we compete with the following companies that offer products that replicate the full range of capabilities we provide for example google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and video sharing and micro blogging companies that provide web and mobile based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage people and capture time spent on mobile devices and online traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences and or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns as we introduce or acquire new products as our existing products evolve or as other companies introduce new products and services we may become subject to additional competition technology our product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience as our user base grows and the level of engagement from the people who use our products continues to increase including on mobile devices our computing needs continue to expand we make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones as well as for our marketers and developers we are also investing in a number of longer term initiatives such as connectivity efforts artificial intelligence research and virtual reality to develop technologies that we believe will help us better serve our communities and pursue our mission to make the world more open and connected our research and development expenses were billion billion and billion in and respectively for information about our research and development expenses see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations research and development of

a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining marketers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the advertising campaign cycle from pre purchase decision making to real time optimizations to postcampaign analytics we work directly with marketers through traditional advertising agencies and with an ecosystem of specialized agencies and partners we currently

data centers in various locations throughout the united states and also own a data center facility in sweden marketing to date our communities have grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest in addition we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to build our

confidentiality procedures non disclosure agreements with third parties employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights in addition to further protect our proprietary rights from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or

of u s federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve user privacy and data protection rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people s data foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states u s federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the european legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for non compliance in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations various laws and regulations in the united states and abroad such as the u s bank secrecy act

additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment risks related to our business and industry if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if users increasingly engage with other products or services we fail to introduce new products or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services that are not favorably received users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency prominence format size and quality of ads that we display users have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services user behavior on any of our products changes including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance there are decreases in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products or concerns related to privacy and sharing safety security or other factors we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is interesting useful and relevant to them we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third party content users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services or may not be featured or otherwise available there are adverse changes in our products that are mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation including settlements or consent decrees technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content we adopt terms policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing or user data that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public we elect to focus our user growth and engagement efforts more on longer term initiatives or if initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued whether as a result of actions by us third parties or otherwise we fail to provide adequate customer service to users marketers or developers we developers whose products are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity or our current or future products such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third party mobile and web applications if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook for and advertising accounted for and respectively of our revenue in addition we have recently introduced advertising on instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have long term advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us we expect our ability to grow advertising revenue will continue to be dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us or the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including decreases in user engagement including time spent on our products our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our mobile products product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand the pricing of our ads or both our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users changes to third party policies that limit our ability to deliver or target advertising on mobile devices the availability accuracy and utility of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers or our ability to further improve such tools loss of advertising market share to our competitors including if prices for purchasing ads on facebook increase or if competitors offer lower priced or more integrated products adverse legal developments relating to advertising including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us content on our products developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry the degree to which users opt out of certain types of ad targeting the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they click on our ads changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced and the impact of macroeconomic conditions whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems any changes in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long term best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long term benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communication and the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products that replicate the full range of capabilities we provide for example google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and video sharing and micro blogging and companies that provide web and mobile based information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent on mobile devices and online in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences and or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook products and services and we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with facebook in favor of increased engagement with these other products and services in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in user engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more far reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook may use information shared by our users through facebook in order to develop products or features that compete with us certain competitors including google could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines or web browsers by making acquisitions by limiting or denying our access to advertising measurement or delivery systems by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or by making it more difficult to communicate with our users as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products compared to our competitors products particularly with respect to mobile products the size and composition of our user base the engagement of our users with our products and competing products the timing and market acceptance of products including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors products our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users our ability to monetize our products the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors customer service and support efforts marketing and selling efforts including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments our ability to establish and maintain developers interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other products changes mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation including settlements and consent decrees some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us acquisitions or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitors our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees particularly software engineers designers and product managers our ability to cost effectively manage and grow our operations and our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected action by governments to restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example in july we acquired oculus vr inc oculus a company developing virtual reality technology we do not have prior experience with consumer hardware products or virtual reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market oculus products or technology and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technology in addition in october we acquired whatsapp inc whatsapp and we have also invested significant resources in growing messenger we have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short term financial results we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to deliver the most relevant content to our users which may adversely affect the distribution of content of marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their development and marketing efforts on facebook we also may introduce changes to existing products or introduce new stand alone products that direct users away from properties where we have a proven means of monetization for example we have taken action to redirect users who send messages from within the facebook application to our stand alone messenger application although we do not monetize the stand alone messenger application in any significant manner in addition we plan to continue focusing on growing the user base for whatsapp and potentially other stand alone applications that may have limited or no near term monetization and it is possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application we also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of mobile products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term these decisions may not produce the long term benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with marketers and developers and our business and results of operations could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third party mobile and web applications integrated with facebook we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy and other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brands we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users or by users acting under false or inauthentic identities by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security related purposes or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business our industry is prone to cyber attacks with third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future as a result of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users to lose confidence in our products or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance government surveillance or other factors in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the actions of our users or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year or other factors the frequency prominence size format and quality of ads shown to users the pricing of our ads and other products our ability to maintain or increase payments and other fees revenue the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on facebook the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors increases in marketing sales and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins costs related to acquisitions including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet our ability to obtain equipment and components for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost effective manner system failures or outages which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time breaches of security or privacy and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third party actions fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products share based compensation expense including acquisition related expense adverse litigation judgments settlements or other litigation related costs changes in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy and data protection or enforcement by government regulators including fines orders or consent decrees the overall tax rate for our business which may be affected by a number of factors including the financial results of our international subsidiaries and the timing size and integration of acquisitions we may make from time to time tax obligations that may arise from changes in laws or resolutions of tax examinations that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates changes in u s generally accepted accounting principles and changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve greater market penetration for example the growth rate of our revenue declined from from to to from to we expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount of content they consume and the data they share with us as we develop and implement new products and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations we expect to continue to invest in our global connectivity efforts which may not have a clear path to monetization we may also be subject to increased costs in order to obtain and attract third party content or to facilitate the distribution of our products in addition we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our oculus products any such investments may not be successful and any such increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability our business is subject to complex and evolving u s and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy and data protection rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations in addition foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states these u s federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process and or receive transnational data that is critical to our operations including data relating to users customers or partners outside the united states and those laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change for example in october the european court of justice invalidated the european commission s safe harbour decision as a legitimate basis on which facebook could rely for the transfer of data from the european union to the united states in addition the other bases on which facebook relies are likely to be subject to regulatory or judicial scrutiny if facebook is unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which it operates it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results proposed legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the european legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for non compliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services these existing and proposed laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries investigations or actions can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquires in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of consumer and data protection as we continue to grow and expand our operations for example several data protection authorities in europe have initiated actions seeking to assert jurisdiction over facebook inc and our subsidiaries and to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information and other data protection authorities may do the same orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a non profit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code and or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various non practicing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non practicing entities from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party s rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative non infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative non infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages and or seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged per user harm is small or non existent in addition we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our ipo we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy and personal injury torts this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for third party actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial for example in we paid approximately billion in cash and issued million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our acquisition of whatsapp and we paid approximately million in cash and issued million shares of our class b common stock in connection with our acquisition of oculus we also issued a substantial number of rsus to help retain the employees of these companies there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions in the future we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our common stock we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example oculus and whatsapp are larger and more complex than companies we have historically acquired in particular oculus builds technology and products that are new to facebook and with which we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support prior to the acquisition we are making substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed if our goodwill or finite lived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we review our finite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finite lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite lived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted as our user base and engagement continue to grow and the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve such as increased engagement with video we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users it is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities our business could be adversely affected our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally and or by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors vulnerabilities or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in measurement or billing errors compromise our ability to protect the data of our users and or our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example social games on facebook rely on adobe flash which games are currently responsible for substantially all of our payments revenue in july certain vulnerabilities discovered in flash led to temporary interruption of support for flash by popular web browsers if similar interruptions occur in the future and disrupt our ability to provide social games to some or all of our users our ability to generate payments revenue would be harmed any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects discovered in the software on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads particularly advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than of our worldwide maus in we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories user misclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or non human entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in for example we estimate that such user misclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while user provided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varied by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the user s ip address and self disclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the user s actual location for example a mobile only user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user s actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to as of december from as of december and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our third party relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at will employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custom made for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high as we mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively we may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile and or web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers and we expect that our payments revenue will continue to decline in the future as usage of facebook on personal computers continues to decline we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers specifically applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games we have experienced and expect to see the continued decline in usage of facebook on personal computers for the foreseeable future which we expect will result in a continuing decline in payments revenue in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebook integrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of facebook on personal computers or otherwise if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook or if facebook integrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance could be adversely affected payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and are applying for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook is not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to third party vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including political social or economic instability risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance intellectual property and terrestrial infrastructure matters potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls foreign exchange controls and tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the united states or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries difficulties in staffing managing and overseeing global operations and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations compliance with the u s foreign corrupt practices act the u k bribery act and similar laws in other jurisdictions and compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our oculus products for example the oculus products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our oculus products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our financial results could be adversely affected we rely on third parties to manufacture our oculus products we may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them we also require the suppliers and business partners of our oculus products to comply with law and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to our reputation in addition the securities and exchange commission s conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of the origin source and chain of custody of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured we may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule such as costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the minerals used in oculus products the adoption of conflict minerals related governance policies processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities we may face inventory risk with respect to our oculus products we may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our oculus products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to oculus products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products oculus may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new oculus product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition in august we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes as of december no amounts were outstanding under this facility if we draw down on this facility in the future our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase significantly which could have an adverse effect on our financial results we may require additional capital to support our business growth and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms if at all we may require additional capital to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances our ability to obtain additional capital if and when required will depend on our business plans investor demand our operating performance the condition of the capital markets and other factors if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equity linked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock and our existing stockholders may experience dilution if we are unable to obtain additional capital when required or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to regular review and audit by u s federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position and results of operations many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business for example in the united kingdom enacted the diverted profits tax and australia passed the tax integrity multinational anti avoidance law both of which could increase our tax obligations the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project and has issued in and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations in addition the current u s administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to u s tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer u s taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations risks related to ownership of our class a common stock the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may at a price of per share our stock price has ranged from to through december in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results the financial projections we may provide to the public any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors additional shares of our class a common stock being sold into the market by us our existing stockholders or in connection with acquisitions including shares sold by our employees to cover tax liabilities in connection with rsu vesting events or the anticipation of such sales investor sentiment with respect to our competitors our business partners and our industry in general announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features technical innovations acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base the level of user engagement or the effectiveness of our ad products changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry including our developers and competitors price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole the inclusion or deletion of our class a common stock from any trading indices such as the s p index media coverage of our business and financial performance lawsuits threatened or filed against us developments in anticipated or new legislation and pending lawsuits or regulatory actions including interim or final rulings by tax judicial or regulatory bodies and other events or factors including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism or responses to these events in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of our class a common stock increases in addition our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the ten to one voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock we have elected to take advantage of the controlled company exemption to the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies which could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have an independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaq listed companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock our status as a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than of the combined voting power of our common stock any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding class b common stock voting as a separate class we have a dual class common stock structure which provides mr zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two thirds of the combined vote of our then outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent only our chairman our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and certain litigation against us can only be brought in delaware item unresolved staff comments none item properties our corporate headquarters are located in menlo park california as of december we owned and leased approximately two million square feet for our corporate headquarters and acres of land to accommodate anticipated future growth in addition we leased office and data center facilities around the world totaling three million square feet we also own data centers in various locations throughout the united states and a data center facility in sweden during we entered into an agreement to lease an entire office building in london united kingdom that is currently under construction as a result of our involvement during the construction period we are considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction project as such we have excluded the square footage from the total leased space and owned properties disclosed above we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs item legal proceedings beginning on may multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors and or certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other trading related errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings in the u s district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in and the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers on july the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions on december the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec in addition we are also currently parties to multiple other lawsuits related to our products including intellectual property lawsuits as well as class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers and we may in the future be subject to additional lawsuits and disputes we are also involved in other claims government and regulatory investigations and proceedings

obligations long term debt total liabilities additional paid in capital total stockholders equity in november the fasb issued accounting standards update no income taxes topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified all of our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets data for all periods presented as a result of the reclassifications certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities as of december and were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets free cash flow in addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap we monitor free cash flow fcf as a non gaap measure to manage our business make planning decisions evaluate our performance and allocate resources we define fcf as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and property and equipment acquired under capital leases we believe that fcf is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business we have chosen to subtract both purchases of property and equipment and property and equipment acquired under capital leases in our calculation of fcf because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business regardless of whether we finance such property or equipment with a capital lease the market for financing servers and other technical equipment is dynamic and we expect our use of capital leases could vary significantly from year to year we have chosen our definition for fcf because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business we use fcf in discussions with our senior management and board of directors fcf has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other gaap financial measures such as net cash provided by operating activities some of the limitations of fcf are fcf does not reflect our future contractual commitments and other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the fcf measure through disclosure of such limitations presentation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap and reconciliation of fcf to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities as presented below the following is a reconciliation of fcf to the most comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities year ended december in millions net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment property and equipment acquired under capital leases free cash flow for the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by million of income tax refundable from income tax loss carrybacks due to the recognition of tax benefits related to share based compensation from restricted stock units granted prior to january we received substantially all of this refund in which increased our net cash provided by operating activities and fcf for the year ended december item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k particularly in part i item risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form k certain revenue information in the sections entitled executive overview of full year results and revenue foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a non gaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year using monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u s dollar this non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year over year comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this non gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business executive overview of full year results our key user metrics and financial results for are as follows user growth daily active users daus were billion on average for december an increase of year over year mobile daus were million on average for december an increase of year over year monthly active users maus were billion as of december an increase of year over year mobile maus were billion as of december an increase of year over year financial results revenue was billion up year over year or year over year on a constant currency basis and ad revenue was billion up year over year or year over year on a constant currency basis total costs and expenses were billion income from operations was billion net income was billion with diluted earnings per share of capital expenditures were billion effective tax rate was cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion as of december headcount was as of december in we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities i continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile ii growing the number of marketers using our ad products and iii making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers in addition we invested and will continue to invest across three priorities i our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses ii our next generation of services such as instagram messenger and whatsapp and iii our long term innovation efforts such as connectivity efforts virtual reality and artificial intelligence research we expect these investments will continue to drive significant overall year over year expense growth compared to trends in our user metrics the numbers for our key metrics our daily active users daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu and certain other metrics such as mobile only daus and mobile only maus do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures daily active users daus we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we view daus and daus as a percentage of maus as measures of user engagement note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east worldwide daus increased to billion on average during december from million during december we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india the united states and brazil overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december compared to the same period in we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions mobile daus we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we define a mobile only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day worldwide mobile daus increased to million on average during december from million during december in all regions an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during december as compared to the same period during with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during december on average during december there were million mobileonly daus increasing from million mobile only daus during the same period in the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future monthly active users maus we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user in the last days as of the date of measurement maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community as of december we had billion maus an increase of from december users in india the united states and brazil represented key sources of growth in overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december compared to the same period in we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions mobile maus we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m facebook com whether on a mobile phone or tablet or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user during the period of measurement we define a mobile only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement worldwide mobile maus increased to billion as of december from billion as of december in all regions an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in as compared to the same period in with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in there were million mobile only maus as of december increasing from million mobile only maus during the same period in the remaining million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during december we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in in the united states canada region was more than seven times higher than in the asia pacific region note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue generating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer for worldwide arpu was an increase of from over this period arpu increased by in united states canada in europe in asia pacific and in rest of world the general strengthening of the u s dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from to had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our arpu outside the united states and canada region in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such as asia pacific and rest of world such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes share based compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k revenue recognition for payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers people can make payments on facebook by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the facebook website the price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties share based compensation we account for share based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all share based payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award share based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share based awards that we expect to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued post acquisition employment we have accounted for them as post acquisition share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management s expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired as of december no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets has been identified acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life components of results of operations revenue advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook

was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices in we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately

estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately of total advertising revenue as compared with in the same period in advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the

current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results

significant accounting policies organization and description of business facebook was incorporated in delaware in july our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising basis of presentation we prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of facebook inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated use of estimates conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources we base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition collectability of accounts receivable contingent liabilities fair value of financial instruments fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment and income taxes these estimates are based on management s knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in the future actual results could differ materially from those estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue once all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of our obligations to our customer has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured revenue for the years ended december and consists of the following in millions year ended december advertising payments and other fees total revenue advertising advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook properties including our mobile applications and third party affiliated websites or mobile applications the arrangements are evidenced by either online acceptance of terms and conditions or contracts that stipulate the types of advertising to be delivered the timing and the pricing marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by our users the number of actions taken by our users or the number of impressions delivered the typical term of an advertising arrangement is less than one month with billing generally occurring after the delivery of the advertisement we recognize revenue from the delivery of click based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content and action based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impression based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit cards and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good from a developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of the transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer the price of the purchase is an amount that is solely determined by the developer our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the service performed we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person additionally we record all payments revenue at the time of the purchase of the related virtual goods net of estimated refunds or chargebacks other fees which includes our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices were not material in all periods presented in our financial statements revenue is recognized net of applicable sales and other taxes cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation energy and bandwidth costs and salaries benefits and share based compensation for employees on our operations teams cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions amortization of intangible assets costs associated with data partner arrangements and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold share based compensation we account for share based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of gaap those provisions require all share based payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight line basis in our consolidated statements of income over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award the majority of our awards are earned over a service period of four years share based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such only those share based awards that we expect to vest are recorded we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued post acquisition employment we have accounted for them as post acquisition share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award during the years ended december and we realized tax benefits from share based award activity of billion billion and million respectively these amounts reflect the extent that the total reduction to our income tax liability from share based award activity was greater than the amount of the deferred tax assets that we had previously recorded in anticipation of these benefits these amounts are the aggregate of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that we recorded reduced by any individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded these net amounts were recorded as an adjustment to stockholders equity in each period as an increase to cash flows from operating activities and were not recognized in our consolidated statements of income in addition we reported excess tax benefits that decreased our cash flows from operating activities and increased our cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december and by billion billion and million respectively the amounts of these excess tax benefits reflect the total of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was greater than the deferred tax assets that were recorded but were not reduced by any of the individual transactions in which the reduction to our income tax liability was less than the deferred tax assets that were recorded income taxes we recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities these differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse we recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties advertising expense advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income we incurred advertising expenses of million million and million for the years ended december and respectively cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds with maturities of days or less from the date of purchase we hold investments in marketable securities consisting of u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cash available for current operations our available for sale investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses net of taxes included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in stockholders equity unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income expense net when a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthan temporary we have not recorded any such impairment charge in the periods presented we determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other income expense net we classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon the term of the remaining restrictions fair value of financial instruments we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis we define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs our valuation technique used to measure the fair value of our contingent consideration liability was based on the present value of probability weighted future cash flows related to the contingent earn out criteria and the fair value of our common stock on each reporting date accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts we make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors including historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of our customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay property and equipment property and equipment which includes amounts recorded under capital leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term in the case of a capital lease whichever is shorter the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below property and equipment useful life network equipment three to five years buildings three to years computer software office equipment and other three to five years leased equipment and leasehold improvements lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use the cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations lease obligations we lease office space data centers and equipment under non cancelable capital and operating leases with various expiration dates through certain of the operating lease agreements contain rent holidays rent escalation provisions and purchase options rent holidays and rent escalation provisions are considered in determining the straight line rent expense to be recorded over the lease term the lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the leased property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease we do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease inception we record assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred by third parties under build to suit lease arrangements to the extent that we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or bear construction risk prior to commencement of a lease loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired as of december no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets has been identified acquired indefinite lived intangible assets related to our in process research and development ipr d are capitalized and subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects upon successful completion of each project we will make a separate determination of useful life of the acquired indefinite lived intangible assets and the related amortization will be recorded as an expense over the estimated useful life of the specific projects acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life deferred revenue and deposits deferred revenue consists of billings in advance of revenue recognition deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users once this balance is utilized by a user approximately of this amount would then be payable to the developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue deferred revenue and deposits consists of the following in millions december deferred revenue deposits total deferred revenue and deposits foreign currency generally the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to u s dollars using month end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for revenue costs and expenses translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a component of stockholders equity as of december and we had a cumulative translation loss net of tax of million and million respectively net losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions were million million and million for the years ended december and respectively these losses were recorded as interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income credit risk and concentration our financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents restricted cash marketable securities and accounts receivable cash equivalents consist of short term money market funds which are managed by reputable financial institutions marketable securities consist of investments in u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities our investment policy limits investment instruments to u s government securities u s government agency securities and corporate debt securities with the main objective of preserving capital and maintaining liquidity accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries we generated and of our revenue for the years ended december and respectively from marketers and developers based in the united states with the majority of revenue outside of the united states coming from customers located in western europe china brazil canada and australia we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses during the years ended december and our bad debt expenses were million million and million respectively in the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected no customer represented or more of total revenue during the years ended december and segments our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer who makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financial information presented on a consolidated basis there are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision maker or anyone else for operations operating results and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level accordingly we have determined that we have a single reportable segment and operating unit structure recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no revenue from contracts with customers topic asu which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition in august the fasb issued asu no revenue from contracts with customers topic deferral of the effective date which delays the effective date of asu by one year the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date as such the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of we are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in november the fasb issued accounting standards update no income taxes topic balance sheet classification of deferred taxes asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet the updated standard is effective for us beginning on january with early application permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period we early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified million of our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets as of december this resulted in net adjustments of million increase and million decrease to our noncurrent deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liability respectively on our december consolidated balance sheet note acquisitions during the year ended december we completed several business acquisitions for total consideration of million primarily related to a business combination involving land and buildings adjacent to our headquarters in menlo park included in this amount is a million promissory note payable issued in connection with this particular acquisition this promissory note payable is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate accordingly pro forma historical results of operations related to these business acquisitions during the year ended december have not been presented we have included the financial results of these business acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition the following table summarizes the allocation of the total consideration transferred during the year ended december including the related estimated useful lives where applicable in millions useful lives in years finite lived intangible assets acquired technology other land acquired other net tangible assets acquired deferred tax assets net net assets acquired goodwill total fair value consideration goodwill generated from all business acquisitions completed during the year ended december is primarily attributable to expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities the amount of goodwill generated during this period that is deductible for tax purposes is not material note earnings per share we compute earnings per share eps of class a and class b common stock using the two class method required for participating securities we consider restricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders basic eps is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of our class a and class b common stock outstanding adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase for the calculation of diluted eps net income attributable to common stockholders for basic eps is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities including awards under our equity compensation plans and inducement awards under separate non plan rsu award agreements in addition the computation of the diluted eps of class a common stock assumes the conversion of our class b common stock to class a common stock while the diluted eps of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to class a common stock diluted eps attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding basic and dilutive securities in our basic and diluted eps calculation for the year ended december and do not include contingent earn out shares issuance of these earn out shares is dependent upon the completion of certain milestones these milestones have not been met as of december and accordingly these shares have been excluded from the effect of basic and dilutive securities the rsus excluded from the eps calculation because the impact would be anti dilutive were not material for the years ended december and respectively basic and diluted eps are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted eps computations for our common stock are calculated as follows in millions except per share amounts year ended december class a class b class a class b class a class b basic eps numerator net income less net income attributable to participating securities net income attributable to common stockholders denominator weighted average shares outstanding less shares subject to repurchase number

gross unrealized gains or losses on our marketable securities as of december and were not significant in addition the gross unrealized loss that had been in a continuous loss position for months or longer was not significant as of december there was no such loss as of december as of december we considered the decreases in market value on our marketable securities to be temporary in nature and did not consider any of our investments to be other than temporarily impaired the following table classifies our marketable securities by contractual maturities in millions december due in one year

develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity we estimate the fair value of our contingent consideration liability based on the present value of probability weighted future cash flows related to the contingent earn out criteria and the fair value of our common stock on each reporting date changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability subsequent to the acquisition date such as changes in the probability assessment and the fair value of our common stock are recognized in earnings in the period when the change in the estimated fair value occurs during the year ended december we recognized an increase in the fair value of our contingent liability of million in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our common stock note property and equipment property and equipment consists of the following in millions december

millions december income tax payable deferred tax liabilities contingent consideration liability other liabilities other liabilities in november the fasb issued asu which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet we early adopted this standard retrospectively and as a result of the reclassifications certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets see note in these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information note long term debt in august we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus as well as an annual commitment fee of on the daily undrawn balance of the facility we paid origination fees at closing of the revolving credit facility which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august as of december no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this facility note commitments and contingencies commitments leases we entered into various capital lease arrangements to obtain property and equipment for our operations additionally on occasion we have purchased property and equipment for which we have subsequently obtained capital financing under sale leaseback transactions these agreements are typically for three years except for a building lease which is for years with interest rates ranging from to the leases are secured by the underlying leased buildings leasehold improvements and equipment we have also entered into various non cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices equipment land and data centers with original lease periods expiring between and we are committed to pay a portion of the related actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements certain of these arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions and we recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight line basis the following is a schedule by years of the future minimum lease

total minimum lease payments less amount representing interest and taxes less current portion of the present value of minimum lease payments capital lease obligations net of current portion in we entered into an agreement to lease an entire office building in london united kingdom that is currently under construction as a result of our involvement during the construction period we are considered to be the owner of the construction project for accounting purposes the above financing obligation building in progress leased facility represents the total expected financing and lease obligation associated with this lease and will be settled through monthly lease payments to the landlord when we occupy the office space upon completion this amount includes million that is included in property and equipment net and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december operating lease expense was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively other contractual commitments we also have billion of non cancelable contractual commitments as of december primarily related to network infrastructure for our data center operations and to a lesser extent construction of our data center sites the majority of these commitments are due within five years contingencies legal matters beginning on may multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors and or certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other trading related errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings in the u s district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in and the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers on july the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions on december the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec we are also party to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business with respect to our outstanding legal matters we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management s expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected indemnifications in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of services and products we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters we have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties these agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers directors and certain employees and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement historically payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in our opinion as of

altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of sharebased compensation expense in an intercompany cost sharing arrangement this opinion concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share share based compensation a final decision was issued by the tax court however this decision may be appealed by the commissioner the impact of the conclusions stated by the tax court in its opinion was not material to our consolidated financial statements we are subject to taxation in the united states and various other state and foreign jurisdictions the material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the united states and ireland we are under examination by the internal revenue service irs for our through tax years we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations and we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next months related to these years our and future years remain open to examination by the irs our and future years remain open to examination in ireland although the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next months however

addition the listing rules generally require that subject to specified exceptions each member of a listed company s audit compensation and governance committees be independent although we are a controlled company under the corporate governance rules of nasdaq and therefore are not required to comply with certain rules requiring director independence we have nevertheless opted under our corporate governance guidelines to have a majority of the members of our board of directors be independent and to have a compensation governance committee comprised solely of independent directors audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in rule under the securities exchange act of as amended exchange act in order to be considered independent for purposes of

upon expiration of the term of a class of directors directors for that class will be elected for three year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which that term expires as a result only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three year terms each director s term continues until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death resignation or removal in addition when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and we have a classified board only our board of directors may fill vacancies on our board any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that as nearly as possible each class will

and analysis overview this section explains our executive compensation philosophy objectives and design our compensation setting process our executive compensation program components and the decisions made in with respect to the compensation of each of our named executive officers our named executive officers for which consist of the executive officers who appear in summary compensation table below are mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and chief executive officer ceo sheryl k sandberg our chief operating officer coo david m wehner our chief financial officer cfo christopher k cox our chief product officer cpo and mike schroepfer our chief technology officer cto executive compensation philosophy objectives and design philosophy we are focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected we believe that facebook is still in the early stages of this journey and that for us to be successful we must hire and retain people who can continue to develop our strategy quickly innovate and build new products bolster the growth of our user base and user engagement and constantly enhance our business model to achieve these objectives we need a highly talented team comprised of engineering product sales and general and administrative professionals we also expect our executive team to possess and demonstrate strong leadership and management capabilities objectives our compensation programs for our named executive officers are built to support the following objectives attract the top talent in our leadership positions and motivate our executives to deliver the highest level of individual and team impact and results encourage our executives to model the important aspects of our culture which include moving fast being bold communicating openly focusing on impact and building social value in the world ensure each one of our named executive officers receives a total compensation package that encourages his or her longterm retention reward high levels of performance with commensurate levels of compensation and align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders in the overall success of facebook by emphasizing long term incentives design our executive compensation program continues to be heavily weighted towards equity in particular restricted stock units rsus with cash compensation that is generally below market relative to executive compensation at our peer companies we believe that equity compensation offers the best vehicle to focus our executive officers on our mission and the achievement of our long term strategic and financial objectives and to align our executive officers with the long term interests of our stockholders we typically grant our executive officers an annual equity award with service based vesting conditions where the commencement of vesting is deferred until a date some years in the future as discussed further in elements of executive compensation equity compensation below when combined with the executives prior equity awards we believe that these additional grants represent a strong long term retention tool and provide the executive officers with long term equity incentives we evaluate our executive compensation programs including our mix of cash and equity compensation on an annual basis or as circumstances require based on our business objectives and the competitive environment for talent for the near future we anticipate continuing our emphasis on pay for performance and long term incentive compensation for our executive officers while increasing cash compensation in order to move closer to market relative to our peer companies compensation setting process role of our compensation governance committee the compensation governance committee is responsible for overseeing all aspects of our executive compensation programs including executive salaries payouts under our bonus plan the size and structure of equity awards and any executive perquisites the compensation governance committee is solely responsible for determining the compensation of our ceo and reviews and approves compensation of other executive officers the compensation governance committee was formed in june by merging two separate committees of our board of directors the compensation committee and the governance committee the compensation governance committee is the successor to the compensation committee in all respects we will not distinguish between the compensation committee and the compensation governance committee and will refer to the compensation governance committee throughout this document role of management in setting compensation for our ceo our coo and our head of people worked closely with the compensation governance committee in managing our executive compensation program and attended meetings of the compensation governance committee our ceo and coo made recommendations to the compensation governance committee regarding compensation for our executive officers other than for themselves because of their daily involvement with our executive team no executive officer participated directly in the final deliberations or determinations regarding his or her own compensation package except for our ceo who has requested that his base salary continue to be fixed at per year our management team and the compensation governance committee each play a role in evaluating and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans practices and policies for all employees including our named executive officers as further described in compensation risk assessment below role of compensation consultant the compensation governance committee has the authority to engage its own advisors to assist in carrying out its responsibilities in the compensation governance committee engaged the services of compensia inc compensia a national compensation consulting firm to advise the compensation governance committee regarding the amount and types of compensation that we provide to our executives and how our compensation practices compared to the compensation practices of other companies compensia reports directly to the compensation governance committee compensia does not provide any services to us other than the services provided to the compensation governance committee the compensation governance committee believes that compensia does not have any conflicts of interest in advising the compensation governance committee under applicable sec or nasdaq rules use of comparative market data we aim to compensate our executive officers at levels that are commensurate with the most competitive levels of compensation for executives in similar positions at a group of publicly traded peer companies set forth below with whom we compete for hiring and retaining executive talent our peer group the compensation governance committee also considered the scope of responsibility of each executive officer our current practice of maintaining minimal differentiation between the cash packages of our executive officers the unvested balances of equity awards for each executive officer as well as the compensation governance committee s assessment of each executive officer s performance and impact on the organization in determining compensation we did not use a formula for taking into account these different factors we analyze market data for executive compensation at least annually using the most relevant published survey sources public filings and input from compensia management and compensia provided the compensation governance committee with both cash and equity compensation data for our peer group which was selected from companies that meet some or all of the criteria listed below high technology or media company key talent competitor minimum revenue of billion and or minimum market capitalization of billion using this criteria as a baseline the compensation governance committee approved the following companies for inclusion in our compensation peer group for adobe microsoft alphabet netflix amazon com qualcomm apple salesforce com cisco systems sap ebay the walt disney company emc twitter linkedin vmware yahoo in the fourth quarter of our compensation governance committee reviewed our executive compensation against this peer group to ensure that our executive officer compensation was competitive and sufficient to recruit and retain our executive officers compensia provided the compensation governance committee with total cash compensation data base salaries and cash bonus awards at target and total compensation data total cash compensation and equity compensation at various percentiles while the compensation governance committee considered this data in determining executive officer compensation we did not seek to benchmark our executive compensation to any particular level the total compensation for our named executive officers was not determined based on any pre set target percentile of market rather we sought to compensate our executive officers at a level that would allow us to successfully recruit and retain the best possible talent for our executive team we relied heavily on the knowledge and experience of the compensation governance committee and our management in determining the appropriate compensation levels for our executive officers overall based on compensia s analysis of our peer group target total cash compensation for our executive officers was below the percentile of our peers when equity compensation was factored in without taking into account the effect of the deferred vesting start dates that are applicable to the equity compensation of our executive officers total compensation for our named executive officers other than our ceo fell between the and percentile relative to the companies in the peer group in the second quarter of the compensation governance committee reviewed the selection criteria and the companies in the peer group following that review the compensation governance committee decided not to make any changes to the composition of the peer group accordingly we plan to use the following list of companies in our peer group for the executive compensation process adobe microsoft alphabet netflix amazon com qualcomm apple salesforce com cisco systems sap ebay the walt disney company emc twitter linkedin vmware yahoo the compensation governance committee expects to periodically review and update this peer group and the underlying criteria as our business and market environment continue to evolve elements of executive compensation our executive officer compensation packages generally include base salary performance based cash incentives and equity based compensation in the form of rsus we believe that our compensation mix supports our objective of focusing on at risk compensation having significant financial upside based on company and individual performance we expect to continue to emphasize equity awards because of the direct link that equity compensation provides between stockholder interests and the interests of our executive officers thereby motivating our executive officers to focus on increasing our value over the long term base salary the compensation governance committee believes base salaries are a necessary element of compensation in order to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers the compensation governance committee reviews base salaries for our executive officers at least annually and may adjust them from time to time if needed to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors historically our executive officers have received base salaries within a very narrow range that was established when we were a smaller company with cash constraints and based on our desire to maintain internal pay equity between executive officers and also relative to other key employees as we have grown we have increased base salaries for our executive officers other than our ceo with the goal of bringing salaries closer to market over time in the first quarter of the compensation governance committee decided to increase the base salaries of our executive officers other than our ceo in order to continue to bring their salaries closer to those paid by our peer group companies for similar positions accordingly our compensation governance committee increased the base salary of ms sandberg by and messrs wehner cox and schroepfer by following these salary increases as noted above these executive officer salaries fell between the and percentile of the salaries provided by our peer group companies for executives in similar positions mr zuckerberg has previously requested to receive a base salary of per year named executive officer base salary mark zuckerberg sheryl k sandberg david m wehner christopher k cox mike schroepfer cash bonuses our bonus plan bonus plan provides variable cash incentives payable semi annually that are designed to motivate our executive officers to focus on company wide priorities and to reward them for individual results and achievements in the individual target bonus percentage for each named executive officer was unchanged from at of such executive s base salary after the base salary increases noted above target total cash compensation base salary plus target bonus for executive officers other than our ceo was at approximately the percentile of our peer group companies for executives in similar positions all of our executive officers except our ceo participated in the bonus plan in for there were two six month performance periods under our bonus plan which we refer to as first half and second half for each performance period in the compensation governance committee approved a set of companywide priorities in order to focus our executive officers on key areas of performance for the period in question the first half and second half company priorities reflect operational and non operational objectives established by our compensation governance committee in consultation with our ceo and cfo the company wide priorities do not have specific targets associated with them for purposes of determining performance under the bonus plan and our compensation governance committee has complete discretion to determine the level of bonus payout for each performance period priorities and company performance percentage our first half company wide priorities were as follows grow our user base across all our products increase sharing and engagement continue to achieve revenue growth and significant savings from efficiency improve product quality improve our brand and make progress toward our long term investments none of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the total bonus the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the company performance percentage on a qualitative basis taking into account our delivery of results in the areas identified by the company wide priorities approved by the compensation governance committee as well as our overall business engineering and product development achievements the compensation governance committee also did not determine any pre set ranges for the company performance percentage the first half company performance percentage approved by the compensation governance committee was the compensation governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company wide priorities our second half company wide priorities were as follows grow our user base across all of our products increase sharing engagement and utility continue to achieve revenue growth and significant savings from efficiency improve product quality improve our brand and make progress toward our long term investments none of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the total bonus the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the company performance percentage on a qualitative basis taking into account our delivery of results in the areas identified by the companywide priorities approved by the compensation governance committee as well as our overall business engineering and product development achievements the compensation governance committee also did not determine any pre set ranges for the company performance percentage the second half company performance percentage approved by the compensation governance committee was the compensation governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company wide priorities particularly the strength of our user growth and engagement and our continued strong revenue growth bonus plan payouts we calculate bonus plan payouts to each participant using the following formula base eligible earnings x individual bonus target percentage x individual performance percentage x company performance percentage individual bonus payout individual performance percentage the individual performance percentage is based upon each executive s individual performance assessment for the performance period under consideration in line with our pay for performance philosophy a higher performance assessment drives a higher individual percentage and vice versa such that it is possible for an executive with a low assessment to get less than their target bonus payout or no bonus payout whatsoever in potential individual performance percentages under our bonus plan were or an executive meeting our expected high level of performance expectations would receive an individual performance percentage of individual performance assessments for each executive officer were determined at the discretion of the compensation governance committee in close consultation with our ceo and our coo except in each case when their own performance assessment was being determined the performance assessment determinations were based on an overall subjective assessment of each officer s performance and no single factor was determinative in setting bonus levels nor was the impact of any individual factor on the bonus quantifiable we operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and we set a high bar for performance expectations for each one of our executive officers the compensation governance committee evaluates our executive officers based on their overall performance impact and results as well as their demonstration of strong leadership long term vision effective execution and management capabilities first half and second half payout levels and achievements and considerations for each executive were as follows mark zuckerberg mr zuckerberg did not participate in the bonus plan in although mr zuckerberg did not participate in the bonus plan the compensation governance committee separately assessed his performance as our ceo sheryl k sandberg ms sandberg received for the first half bonus which reflected her overall leadership and execution on business priorities her contribution to growing revenue including the continued growth in mobile ad revenue and her leadership in key policy matters ms sandberg received for the second half bonus which reflected her role in growing our revenue year over year her strategic guidance in various business matters and the strong growth in the number of advertisers on our platform david m wehner mr wehner received for the first half bonus which reflected his overall leadership of our finance organization and in particular driving long range planning for the company mr wehner received for the second half bonus which reflected his effective communication with our investors strategic facilities planning for our growing workforce and his contributions to the strong financial performance of the company as well as the overall performance of the finance function christopher k cox mr cox received for the first half bonus which reflected his overall leadership of the product organization improvements in the quality of news feed and his contributions to increases in user growth and engagement mr cox received for the second half bonus which reflected his leadership and innovations in the areas of product design and engagement such as reactions progress in our brand efforts and continued growth in time spent with our products mike schroepfer mr schroepfer received for the first half bonus which reflected his leadership and execution on our engineering priorities recruitment of engineering leadership talent and the continued development of a sustainable and cost effective engineering infrastructure mr schroepfer received for the second half bonus which reflected his strong leadership of the engineering team successful launch of gear vr and continued progress on other long term investments the following table summarizes the calculations that were used in determining the cash bonus paid to each of our named executive officers performance period base eligible earnings individual bonus percentage target bonus individual performance percentage company performance percentage individual bonus payout sheryl k sandberg first half second half total david m wehner first half second half total christopher k cox first half second half total mike schroepfer first half second half total reflects actual earnings for which may differ from approved base salaries due to the effective dates of salary increases and the number of pay dates in the calendar year equity compensation most of our executive officers compensation is delivered through equity awards we use equity compensation to align our executive officers financial interests with those of our stockholders to attract industry leaders of the highest caliber and to retain them for the long term in addition to the initial equity grant that each executive receives as part of his or her new hire package the compensation governance committee typically grants our executives additional equity awards each year as part of our company wide equity refresher program additional equity grants for each of our executive officers are determined on a discretionary basis taking into account the following factors delivering equity values that are highly competitive when compared against those our peer group would grant to executives with similar responsibility each executive officer s individual performance assessment the results and contributions delivered during the year as well as the anticipated potential future impact of each individual executive the size and vesting schedule of existing equity grants in order to maximize the long term retentive power of all additional grants and the size of each executive officer s total cash compensation base salary plus cash bonus awards at target which is generally lower than the cash compensation for executives with similar responsibilities at our peer group based on the foregoing factors in our compensation governance committee awarded each of our executive officers other than our ceo a grant of rsus with a specific initial equity value based on an estimated total value for each grant before taking into account the deferred vesting considerations described below the compensation governance committee applied discretion in determining the specific individual equity values vesting schedules and vesting start dates based on these qualitative decisions the compensation governance committee then calculated the number of rsus to be granted by dividing this initial equity value by per share which was the average closing price for the seven trading days following the announcement of our earnings for the fourth quarter of and the same price that was used for refresher grants to all other employees vesting of rsu grants due to our desire to provide incentives for our executive officers to focus on long term strategic and financial objectives the compensation governance committee deferred the vesting start dates of all rsu grants made to our executive officers other than our cfo to a future date determined individually for each executive as a result the rsu grants generally will not begin to vest unless the recipient remains continuously employed by us through future dates as described in the following paragraphs and in grants of plan based awards table below the compensation governance committee reviewed the size and vesting schedule for the remaining unvested portion of the outstanding equity award holdings of each of our executive officers and agreed with the recommendation of our ceo and coo except that our coo did not participate in discussions regarding her own equity compensation that the existing equity awards appropriately satisfied our retention and incentive goals for the immediate future for each of our executive officers accordingly the additional equity awards granted to our executive officers in other than our cfo start vesting only after a significant portion of each executive s outstanding equity awards have vested the compensation governance committee believes that these deferred vesting schedules make the equity awards more valuable to us in retaining our executive officers and reflect our emphasis on our long term success in the case of our cfo the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate not to defer the vesting start date for mr wehner s rsu grant in order to increase his total compensation to a level appropriate for his new role as cfo typically the rsu grants for our executive officers vest over four years following the vesting start date the compensation and governance committee determined that it was appropriate to shorten the vesting schedule for ms sandberg and lengthen the vesting for mr wehner based on individual circumstances described below for more information relating to the vesting schedules of these rsu grants see grants of plan based awards table below equity grants mr zuckerberg did not receive any additional equity grants in because our compensation governance committee believed that his existing equity ownership position sufficiently aligns his interests with those of our stockholders our other named executive officers received the following rsu grants in sheryl k sandberg ms sandberg received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to three year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of november the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate for this rsu grant to vest over three years in order to deliver competitive compensation in future years david m wehner mr wehner received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to five year vesting with a one year cliff based on continued employment from and after a vesting start date of february such that one fifth of the shares shall vest on february and the remainder of the shares shall vest quarterly thereafter the compensation governance committee determined that it was appropriate for this rsu grant to vest over five years to increase the retentive power of this grant christopher k cox mr cox received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to four year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of february mike schroepfer mr schroepfer received an equity grant in the amount of rsus this grant had an initial equity value of million these rsus are subject to four year quarterly vesting based on continued employment from and after a deferred vesting start date of

limited perquisites that are for business related purposes or necessary for the security of our ceo and coo and our executives participate in broad based company sponsored health and welfare benefits programs on the same basis as our other full time salaried employees perquisites and other benefits consistent with the practices of many companies in our peer group we provide certain perquisites to our named executive officers for the reasons described below because of the high visibility of our company our compensation governance committee has authorized an overall security program for mr zuckerberg to address safety concerns due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder chairman and ceo we require these security measures for the company s benefit because of the importance of mr zuckerberg to facebook and we believe that the costs of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary we paid for the initial procurement installation and maintenance of security measures for mr zuckerberg s personal residences and we pay for the annual costs of security personnel in addition mr zuckerberg uses private aircraft for personal travel in connection with his overall security program on certain occasions mr zuckerberg may be accompanied by guests when using private aircraft although we do not consider mr zuckerberg s overall security program to be a perquisite for his benefit for the reasons described above the costs related to personal security for mr zuckerberg at his residence and during personal travel as well as the costs of private aircraft for personal travel pursuant to mr zuckerberg s overall security program are reported as other compensation to mr zuckerberg in the all other

amended code limits the amount that we may deduct from our federal income taxes for remuneration paid to our named executive officers other than our cfo to million dollars per executive officer per year unless certain requirements are met section m provides an exception from this deduction limitation for certain forms of performance based compensation as well as for the gain recognized by covered executive officers upon the exercise of qualifying compensatory stock options in addition grandfather provisions may apply to certain compensation arrangements that were entered into by a corporation before it was publicly held and through april while our compensation governance committee is mindful of the benefit to us of the full deductibility of compensation our compensation governance committee believes that it should not be constrained by the requirements of section m where those requirements would impair flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives therefore our compensation governance committee has not adopted a policy that requires that all compensation be deductible and accordingly gain recognized from rsus granted after april may be non deductible our compensation governance committee intends to continue to compensate our executive officers in a manner consistent with the best interests of our company and our stockholders in addition because of the fact based nature of the performance based compensation exception under section m and the limited availability of formal guidance thereunder we cannot guarantee that any compensation arrangements intended to qualify for exemption under section m will actually receive this treatment compensation risk assessment our management team and the compensation governance committee each play a role in evaluating and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans practices and policies for all employees including our named executive officers in early compensia the compensation governance committee s independent compensation consultant performed an assessment in conjunction with management of our compensation plans and practices and concluded that our compensation program does not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company the compensation governance committee has reviewed this report and agreed with the conclusion the objective of the assessment was to identify any compensation plans or practices that may encourage employees to take unnecessary risk that could threaten the company no such plans or practices were identified the risk assessment process included among other things a review of our cash and equity incentivebased compensation plans to ensure that they are aligned with our company performance goals and the overall compensation to ensure an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay components and between short and long term incentives report of the compensation governance committee this report of the compensation governance committee is required by the securities and exchange commission sec

connection with a termination or a change in control limitations on liability and indemnification matters our restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the delaware general corporation law consequently our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors except liability for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in section of the delaware general corporation law

retain qualified persons such as directors officers and key employees we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our

first improving the user interface of the seller panel for better ease of posting ads second lowering the prices for ads to ensure better roi and third increasing seller awareness with respect to how they can utilise the ad platforms better most e tailers first start with keyword based monetisation it is affordable and costs around per month but solutions like homepage banners email marketing category page banner etc can run into lakhs of rupees e commerce players need to make the model more affordable for the majority of the sellers yes advertising is lucrative as in most cases the same or slightly upgraded infrastructure can start generating ad revenue but it may take years for it to become the primary reason for profitability say analysts it took amazon com several years to transform advertising into a core business and the same will apply here but in the near future it may remain an ancillary revenue stream our advertising platform is seeing about growth month on month

compensation benefits employee benefits employee benefits are optional non wage compensation provided to employees in addition to their normal wages or salaries these types of benefits may include group insurance health dental vision life etc disability income protection retirement benefits daycare tuition reimbursement sick leave vacation paid and non paid funding of education as well as flexible and alternative work arrangements in this section the benefits of benefits plan the basics health dental life ad d long term disability employee assistance plans eaps retirement benefits indirect non financial compensation the benefits of benefits plans although expensive there are many intrinsic benefits to providing your employees with a comprehensive benefit plan for most it is the ability to find and keep highly qualified staff that is the key driver with the sector being highly competitive and the number of new employees entering the workforce dwindling employers are challenged to become even more creative and responsive in the design timing and generosity of their benefit plans the more progressive the organization the more flexible the structure is in response to today s challenges i e like having four different generations of employees working side by side employers who continue to provide the more traditional and limited program may find it more difficult to find and keep different types of employees here are just a few of the advantages of offering benefits to your employees for employers by providing increased access and flexibility in employee benefits employers can not only recruit but retain qualified employees providing benefits to employees is seen as managing high risk coverage at low costs and easing the company s financial burden employee benefits have been proven to improve productivity because employees are more effective with they are assured of security for themselves and their families premiums are tax deductible as corporation expense which means savings for the organization for employees employees can experience a peace of mind which leads to increased productivity and satisfaction by being assured that they are their families are protected in any mishap employees with personal life and disability insurance can enjoy additional protection including income replacement in the event of serious illness or disability employees can feel a sense of pride in their employer if they are satisfied with the coverage they receive back to top the basics health dental health and dental benefits are considered the foundation of any benefit program design when considering the root issues of all absenteeism from the workplace most employers agree that health or dental related illness is cited most as the cause while many have not thought of dental coverage as being a key attraction point a number of medical reports have been published recently that indicate that many of our common virus and illnesses are actually related to poor dental health an organization s ability to be creative flexible and generous in providing health and dental coverage can be a key to attracting and retaining top performers as part of the total compensation package health even in canada where government plans provide approximately of all healthcare expenses the remaining gap is still perceived as a major concern for employees and employers private healthcare plans are restricted by legislation to expenses not fully covered by government programs organizational health expense plans are generally permitted in the following areas across canada hospital room charges in excess of the standard rate to cover semi private or private accommodation hospital charges for emergency treatment outside canada drugs medication and vaccines and other supplies available only by prescription professional services of a physician for out of country medical expenses professional services for private duty nursing charges for special medical appliances such as crutches artificial limbs or wheelchairs non emergency ambulance services dental treatments not requiring hospitalization professional services provided by licensed paramedicals such as psychologists massage therapists speech therapists podiatrists physiotherapists chiropractors osteopaths or naturopaths vision care expenses including frames and lenses contact lenses fitting and remedial treatment laser eye correction surgery this option is one that many employers struggle to provide their employees with as the number requiring vision care is so great the cost of including this option could raise the employer s costs by anywhere from to it is common practice to include many of the above items under a single extended healthcare plan most benefit carriers will tailor a plan to include only those features and coverage s desired certain items however are often restricted or sold in combination with other coverage s to contain overall plan costs or to subsidize heavily utilized services extended healthcare plan options should be selected based on the organization s overall compensation objectives and employee needs for small organizations the range of coverage options may be limited if the plans are financed on a fully insured basis these plans offer restricted flexibility to limit the occurrence of high risk claims these pre packaged plans are available to small organizations through affiliation with umbrella organizations such as chambers of commerce boards of trade trade associations and professional organizations for larger organizations the range of options is mostly limited by cost considerations dental dental plan design is the art of finding a delicate balance between understanding what the foundational priorities are and allocating sufficient funds to ensure that the coverage is perceived as being sufficient and appropriate although the type of dental work can differ from person to person some common elements have been found most employees their spouses and children require basic preventative dental care and repair therefore most employers elect to design the plan in such a way as to minimize the cost to employees of basic coverage since major restorative care and orthodontics tend to be more elective in nature and less common in need across the employee group than basic services most plans do not provide equal coverage in all areas for example the plan might pay of basic and of the other two categories it is also common to find deductibles co insurance and benefit maximums for the non basic services to free up more funds for the necessary preventive ones high employee deductibles and co insurance percentages can help to limit plan disbursements because employees will be paying more of the total costs the potential problem is that these high employee costs may in effect force postponement of needed dental work until the repair bill is even higher paying of basic preventative care from day one is the overwhelming choice of employers having the dental plan require a pre treatment evaluation for certain expenses helps control cost levels by ensuring that the plan only pays for reasonable treatments it also avoids any misunderstanding by the employee as to what services are covered and how much he or she is required to pay it is always preferable to ensure the employee knows what the plan will pay for and what exact dollar amount is their responsibility a commonly asked question of benefit administrators is why the dental plan is not optional but compulsory if the plan is optional only those employees who are likely to need dental care will sign up they will almost always use services that exceed their contributions deductibles and co insurance those who feel that the benefits will not cover their costs will decline because of this adverse selection cost per employee will be so high that employers would not be perceived as competitive back to top life and ad d most employers design their plans with a provision to protect the employee and or their family in the event of accidental death or dismemberment ad d employers often provide basic coverage as a factor of the employee s salary example the employee s salary in the event of death or total paralysis with additional coverage available should the employee chose to purchase it each employee benefit plan should include a chart that identifies what coverage is available and the associated cost back to top long term disability long term disability is an income replacement provision this is one provision that cannot be purchased through a spousal plan employees are asked to pay the total cost of the premiums in order to receive a tax free payment should they be unable to work long term disability coverage is applied for when an employee is unable to complete a certain percentage of the essential duties of their role due to illness on an ongoing basis the structure of each plan can differ slightly so understanding what you are trying to achieve with this program including elimination periods and termination options is critical at the outset employee assistance plans eaps an eap or employee assistance program is a confidential short term counseling service for employees with personal problems that affect their work performance studies have shown that providing confidential qualified counseling and support can reduce the stress and conflict felt by the employee which in turn can reduce absenteeism and ultimately turnover one on one sessions are offered and online information coaching and support services are also available employees turn to the eap for help with a variety of issues including the following dependent care issues such as searching for child care information identifying services for special needs children obtaining advice on the college application process or arranging for residential care for an elder dealing with the stress of a major life change even a positive one such as having or adopting a child getting married moving or buying a home or getting a promotion serious personal or professional concerns such as general anxiety depression substance abuse burnout coping with illness the loss of a loved one relationship challenges or resolving interpersonal conflicts different types of programs are available to employers to provide employee assistance employers can establish their own in house programs join a consortium of organizations to provide external services or refer employees to public and private providers of this service the range of costs across these options can vary widely organizations must then decide the most advantageous approach to achieve the level of improved wellness among their employees in selecting the best eap provider several factors need to be considered how accessible and convenient are the services to be provided location of offices and confidentially concerns are important here how is the quality of services to be measured how is client satisfaction to be assessed how are service costs to be determined and will there be limits placed on the frequency and extent of services provided what will the charges be per hour of service per individual before choosing an eap provider these questions need to be answered and the answers reflected in any service proposal or contract back to top retirement benefits a retirement plan or a pension is an arrangement by an employer to provide their employees with an income when they are no longer earning a regular income from working retirement plans may be set up by in a variety of ways but typically will have a form of a guaranteed payment often retirement plans require both the employer and employee to contribute money into a fund while employed so that they will receive benefits upon retirement pension plans are considered a form of delayed income pension plans pension plans are usually classified as either defined benefit or defined contribution according to how the payments are determined a defined benefit plan guarantees a predictable monthly payment at retirement calculated by using an established formula with some combination of the employee s salary years of service and or age a defined contribution plan will provide a payment payout at retirement that will be determined by the amount of money contributed during the life of the plan and the performance of the stock or investments used registered retirement savings plans a registered retirement savings plan or rrsp is an account that provides tax benefits for saving for retirement yet is not necessarily based on the employer employee relationship rrsps can provide ways to save money for retirement and defer and reduce taxes because contributions to rrsps up to established limits may be deducted from income in pre taxed dollars income earned within the account is not taxed until money is withdrawn from the plan rrsp accounts can be setup with as either individual rrsp an individual rrsp is associated with only a single individual only they contribute money to their rrsp spousal rrsp the spouse of the contributor is actually the account holder a spousal rrsp is a means of splitting income in retirement group rrsp an employer can arrange for employees to make contributions through a schedule of regular payroll deductions in many organizations rrsp contributions can be based on a matching program this means that the employer will put in a certain percentage or dollar amount based on the contributions the employee makes the employee gets to receive the tax savings immediately at the time of deduction instead of having to wait until the end of the tax year phased retirement today s work place is challenged with having up to four different generations working side by side for most employers designing a compensation and benefit structure that address the unique needs of each demographic group is a complex task added to that is the shift in pension structures over the past few years some non profit organizations provide their employees with a pension fund however most tend to offer only contributions to an rrsp this leads to an increasing number of employees not feeling able to retire it is important that organizations understand the details of their pension plan whether it is a defined benefit or contribution or simply an rrsp program before considering design changes for those not hindered by a design change one option that is gaining in popularity especially in this sector is providing a phased retirement program for older skilled employees for employees components of the phased program are allowing employees who might be considering retiring to delay their departure date continue to earn a partial income that reduces the burden on their pension income they continue to receive benefit coverage and are able to acclimate gradually by continuing to reduce their hours until they are prepared to leave for employers employers are able to develop a timely and effective succession plan without losing critical skills or intellectual capital organizations benefit by being able to tap into the most experienced staff at a reduced salary while transitioning to a new team or organizational design hurdles employees need to understand the impact continuing to work may have on pension or benefit programs also to be considered is the timing of starting your phased approach if an employee starts too soon they might not have accumulated enough to compensate for the reduced salary employers need to be sure that the phased retirement program is structured in a way that will not diminish the work of the organization or the financial position of the employee back to top indirect non financial compensation indirect compensation will look different in every organization ultimately it is the way in which you choose to define the culture of your organization and your total compensation rewards program that will differentiate it of course it is important to ensure it aligns with organizational strategic objectives recent studies all indicate that in today s changing work environment it is the flexibility and creativity that draws and keeps the highly skilled employee benefit perspective from a benefit perspective being creative and considering ways to improve the access or quality of your benefits could look like allowing employees to access their benefit as of their hire date being able to accumulate sick days to bridge to disability coverage being able to use some sick days as personal health days to allow employees to have a break without using all their holidays or pretending to be sick receiving your birthday off with pay eliminating the probationary period language from contracts offer letters seeking insurance providers with vision care benefits at reasonable costs allowing for some increased flexibility in personalizing benefit options i e health spending accounts vision care versus dental and more paramedical coverage although these options have a cost associated with them the cost is significantly less than the benefit an organization can reap in return if your insurance provider does not allow you the freedom to make some adjustments in your plan then it might be time to research what else is available other perspectives many articles have been written highlighting the keys to creating the best organization and to finding and keeping the best employees in recent studies the following were identified as key factors compensation paying employees fairly against both the market conditions as well as ensuring internal equity was still the number one factor considered providing clear information on the organization s compensation structure and consistent processes were critical to an employee s sense of commitment professional development for many people especially the younger generations the ability to develop both personally and professionally was highly valued and a key consideration deciding where to work access to training and development on the job and through courses or conferences were listed in a study done by the conference board of canada as important another variation of this was receiving reimbursement for courses taken on the employee s own time most commonly reimbursed were courses that aligned with a professional designation in the employees current role culture employees who were surveyed and asked what kept them in their current role indicated that having a culture that recognized the importance of connecting performance to rewards were key to their satisfaction performance management was one component that influenced the culture having clearly defined expectations being able to identify goals to work towards and having their evaluation align with those agreed to goals contributed to higher satisfaction levels receiving effective and realistic feedback both positive and constructive increased a continuous learning environment and increases commitment to the organization because performance both good and bad is recognized succession planning when operating within an organization brings a sense of purpose and sustainability to employees confidence in the future and their role it in was reported consistently by those who had been identified for a succession plan consider ways to develop younger staff with great potential by having them be identified as a potential successor to a long term employee the employee wins by learning new and critical skills while feeling rewarded for their hard work to date the more senior person feels rewarded for years of service and identified as a key contributor the organization wins by ensuring that intellectual capital is not lost but transitioned from one employee to another trust demonstrated as part of the culture of an organization is highly valued by all generations of employees in steven covey s book moving at the speed of trust leaders are challenged to evaluate if their organization s culture is one of trust or mistrust employees who feel trusted and respected will strive harder to maintain that trust and are less likely to do something that will result in a loss of trust workplace flexibility alternative work arrangements are effective ways to negotiate an arrangement that meet the needs of the organization while also providing employees will what they need to balance their home and work environments listed below are just some of the ideas that could be explored finding out what your organization would value can start this process the key is to ensure that any alternative arrangements considered do not hinder the organization s ability to ensure that core work is being completed in the time and manner required to maintain sustainability having clear expectations on both the organization and the employee s part as to the terms and conditions of the alternative work arrangement can prevent ineffective or damaging results flexible time this can be establishing core hours then allowing employees to work earlier in the day or later in the day example core hours are to person a starts at and works till person b works from to seasonal hours can be established in a variety of terms just as flexible hours schedule of part time employees example hiring a part time person to work days a week or a but they actually work full time for months a year and then take a combination of their time vacation and hours and take a month in the summer and a month in the winter off work they would continue to receive the salary for months a year compressed work week allowing an employee to work their full number of hours in less days example core hours are hours per week the employee works hours days instead of hour days job sharing having qualified employees share the duties and tasks of one position both could work days or alternative between days one week and the next the advantage of job sharing is having people who both know the role the downside can be having a communication gap between individuals doing the role consider having an employee who is contemplating retirement job share with a more junior employee with high potential transition knowledge skills and commitment telecommuting this is the practice of allowing an employee work from their home location instead of on your premises there are guidelines governing the considerations for this type of employment in the past ten years the number of people telecommuting has tripled with results indicating that increased productivity and effectiveness were seen from this type of working arrangement regular part time work many people today are looking for meaningful work but on a part time basis a desire to balance work and life priorities has increased exponentially over the past decade and employers who recognize the contribution part time employees can make are leading their organizations forward educational partnership many employees are looking for opportunities to balance academic pursuits with employment opportunities considering how you could structure a role for a person in the final stages of their education could result in an increased pool of potential employees and employees who will be loyal to an organization that provided with them practical experience and the ability to create a flexible schedule regardless of whether you are developing an alternative work arrangement or increasing the flexibility of your benefit program it is important to understand what motivates employees and what culture you are building in your organization the better able you are to align the two together the increased success you will have
