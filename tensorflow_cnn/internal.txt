the following guidance is intended to assist policy writers to develop policy documents and should be read in conjunction with the policy document template summary table all the important information relating to the policy should be displayed at the top of the policy document so that it is easily accessible for the reader this information should include the policy title date of approval effective date date for review name of the policy officer policy title where possible the first word of the title should refer to the substance of the policy this will assist the reader access the policy from the policy a z e g accreditation of prior learning policy rather than policy on the accreditation of prior learning structure information should be presented in a logical sequence to assist the reader policy writers should use the section structure provided within the template but may create sub headings if necessary context may contain some contextual or background information and may include a sentence on how the policy supports the university s strategic plan definitions if necessary include an explanation of terms or abbreviations used within the policy and procedure where there are existing definitions of the terms in other university regulations or policy those definitions should be used purpose a concise statement on why the policy exists and what is its intent this statement should not contain background information or detailed explanations and should be suitable to act as a summary for viewing on the policy a z prior to the user reviewing the whole document scope specify the parameters of the policy which university cohort does the policy apply to this section should also reference any exclusions from the operation of the policy policy principles principles should provide broad directional information and the rationale for the policy by embodying the university s expected outcomes of its application roles and responsibilities some policies may require the articulation of roles to be undertaken by those responsible for applying the policy outline the university s expectations and detail the responsibilities of relevant parties process optional detailed operational procedures are separate from policy documents however some procedural information may be appropriately provided in the policy document particularly with regard to academic decision making policy toolkit guidelines for completion of policy documents document management policy documents and appendices are structured and presented consistently using the policy document template document control during the development stage there may be a number of people contributing to the development of a draft policy and so document version control is very important it is the responsibility of the policy officer to keep track of the developing drafts of the document via a continuously updated master document version numbers should be used to signify each revised version of the draft and a record of summarised revisions should be kept by the policy officer document version history all policy documents should include a comprehensive revision list at the end of the document this should chart the formal approval route and note any changes proposed by university committees this version history should remain on the published policy document and be updated following any subsequent changes to the policy style when drafting policy documents it is useful to bear in mind that different audiences are likely to access the policy and that policy users are not necessarily subject matter experts and may be accessing information on a topic for the first time it is important that policy documents are written in a clear and concise manner using plain english and avoiding jargon to ensure consistency of style and presentation those drafting policy documents are asked to consider the following use the policy document template use plain english and simple short sentences main headings and paragraphs should be numbered sequentially to facilitate referencing policy should be directive in style and therefore words such as will and must are appropriate to create a recognisable identity for policy documents a uniform format should be used font arial headings in bold and paragraphs separated by one line space policies should be as succinct as possible

products are re inspected in order to issue either an up to date certificate or an appeal certificate frequently the applicant doesn t question the quality and condition of the lot but needs a current certificate in order to satisfy a buyer seller contract occasionally the quality of previously inspected merchandise is questioned by a financially interested party and they request an appeal inspection inspection certificates are accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts contained within although it is division policy to assign only one grade representing a specific lot as a whole there have been cases involving the perishable agricultural commodities act paca in which both the plaintiff and defendant produced usda certificates each with a different grade it is very difficult to settle such claims unless the grade on one certificate can be reversed there should be no conflicting certificates on the lot unless the quality of the lot has changed due to age storage handling or other condition factors if such a change has taken place the original certificate is valid for the date of original inspection and the later certificate is also valid for the date of the later inspection these instructions will address such situations a formal appeal inspections if possible formal appeal inspections should be discouraged an appeal may often be avoided by having the inspector or supervisor review a few samples of the product with the applicant he or she can explain why the sample units were assigned a certain grade or why certain factors were evaluated as they were if the applicant requests a formal appeal the inspection should be handled as outlined in the regulations for appeal inspections these instructions supplement the regulations filing for appeal an appeal inspection may be requested by any financially interested party who is not satisfied with the results of the inspection as represented by a certificate on the lot in question they may file for an appeal provided a the lot of processed products can be identified as the same lot previously inspected b the request is within days of the previous inspection this period may be extended by the regional or national offices and c the complaint concerns a factor s which would not be a result of a change in a condition factor s since the previous inspection see section below sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the division will issue an appeal certificate when it has been established that the previous inspection is in error the original certificate is reversed and copies of the appeal certificate are sent to all financially interested parties denying request for appeal requests for an appeal inspection may be denied under the following circumstances a the complaint concerns a factor which may have undergone a change of condition since the original inspection such as oxidation of frozen fruits severe de tinning of apple sauce or other canned product hydrogen swells or other types of spoilage frozen broccoli or asparagus spears that are shattered due to possible mishandling flavor deterioration of canned citrus juice due to long storage at high temperatures and severe dehydration of frozen vegetables b the lot cannot be identified c the first inspection certification was based on restricted sampling for an example of a certificate showing restricted sampling see the aim inspection series certification manual d code marks do not agree with the original inspection e count does not agree with the original certificate there are certain exceptions to this provision if the original certificate covered a large lot and the re inspection covers a substantial quantity of merchandise an appeal on a portion of the original certificate may be granted provided that there is no question about identity however an appeal would not be granted on a very small segment of the original quantity for example if the quantity would be substantially less than the quantity represented by a single sample unit on the original inspection f lot is not accessible for proper sampling g if there has been a revision to the grade standards between the two sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of inspections and such revision would affect the grade assigned to the product h the original certificate is grade not certified gnc account unsanitary conditions of the plant or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material for example a frog or mouse may be found in a container during the original inspection plant conditions may warrant a gnc certificate even though this incident is strictly accidental it would be most unlikely that a re inspection of the lot would find another frog or mouse however the division would not deem it advisable to completely ignore previous production or inspection history and reverse the original inspection certificate i reasons for appeal are inadequate or frivolous for example i just don t trust the inspectors in the location office j when it is not in the interest of usda to perform the appeal this is a broad category and the national office would need to evaluate all facts in order to render an appropriate decision even if denied an appeal inspection due to any of these reasons the applicant may request a re inspection or an up to date inspection on the lot in question the result of this new inspection would establish the grade of the lot except that no grade would be assigned if usda records show that the original certificate was gnc account unsanitary processing conditions or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material see h above performing the appeal a information required the application may be made orally or in writing if made orally it must be confirmed in writing it must include the location of the lot the reason s for the appeal the date and serial number of the certificate covering the original inspection of the product and the name of issuing office sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b sampling the sampling rate on an appeal inspection should be at least the next sample size larger than the normal sampling rate for the lot size based on the single sampling plan in other words if the sample size in the regulations would normally be for the size of lot involved at least sample units would be drawn on the same lot for an appeal inspection if the applicant merely requests an up to date inspection and it is not known until the sample is examined that an appeal is in order as determined by the division the certificate should not be issued until additional sample units are drawn since stratification can occur in large containers at least a portion of samples of bulk container lots such as pound frozen should be full containers for example frozen strawberries may contain rocks that would tend to settle to the bottom of the can during handling prior to freezing a subsample from the top or center of the can is not likely to reveal the presence of this type of foreign material c who may perform the appeal inspection any inspector other than the inspector who performed the original inspection may perform an appeal inspection whenever practical two inspectors who are thoroughly familiar with the product should be assigned to conduct the appeal if one inspector starts the inspection and the need to issue an appeal inspection certificate doesn t become evident until the inspection is partially complete a second inspector should be called in to confirm the results d notify the regional and national offices if a formal appeal is filed or if during a routine re inspection procedure it appears that an appeal is in order notify the regional and national offices they may require a few samples to verify the new inspection results e examination of product because of the economic significance of the appeal all samples of the product should be very carefully graded and checked for all factors if objective tests are available they should be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of f gnc ordinarily an appeal would not be granted because of unsanitary plant or product conditions where the original inspection findings make an appeal unjustified see h on page fees a appeal fees are as follows grade sustained charge regular fee plus expenses grade reversed no charge for inspection but charge applicant for expenses incurred in sampling or shipping samples note an appeal certificate reversing the original inspection can only be issued after receiving authority from the national office if the inspection results indicate that this is the case submit details to the regional office the regional office will confer with the national office before results are reported or a certificate is issued certification see the aim inspection series certification manual for specific information related to the certification of appeals and re inspections sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of bulk containers frozen products packed in used containers used pound metal and or plastic containers with friction type lids are refilled by some processors of frozen foods reused containers must be clean at time of refilling obtain a letter of conformance from the processor stating that the containers were not previously used for non food products products filled into unsanitary containers are to be classed as grade not certified gnc it may be difficult to accurately describe reused containers some of these may have been used several times and appear to be old abused or otherwise damaged they may bear an assortment of code marks and label statements certification statements regarding used containers may be found in the aim inspection series certification manual note reused containers are not acceptable for government purchases state federal and department of defense unless specified in the contract or solicitation do not certify without a written waiver unless specified in the contract tote bins many packers use large bulk containers called tote bins for frozen vegetables these bins are used during the packing season to store frozen vegetables for repack at a later date the bins vary in size and construction but can hold as much as a ton of product for financial reasons users of tote bins need to know whether or not the product is free flowing or frozen in a solid mass the type of pack should always be shown in the body of the inspection certificate a free flowing describes a pack in which the individual units of the pack are not frozen together in a solid mass but may be easily separated into individual units there may be some crusting on the interior surface of the tote bin or a few clumps of units frozen together within the container but these can be separated with moderate pressure b solid mass describes a pack in which the individual units of the product in the container are predominantly or entirely frozen together in a solid mass such product will require additional cost in repacking the product due a special break up step in the process for the purpose of inspection and certification a lot can be a group of tote bins or a single tote bin tote bins must be properly identified for future re inspection segregation etc codes should be at least inch in height and stamped on the tote bins or on tags placed in upper right or left hand corner of the side normally facing the fork lift driver the area for applying the codes may be painted to facilitate application and legibility sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the coding system may include the following plant when more than plant is operated by the same company quality designation date of pack day month and year product type style size etc when not readily apparent such as covered bins or numerous product styles period shift or lot number bin numbers special notation of abnormal quality variations i e grade b for color only etc different colored tape tags or marking ink for different quality levels or other special notations to determine the sampling rate for an item packed in tote bins or bulk storage the poundage is converted to institutional size pound containers using the number of pound containers the lot would represent refer to the regulations or the aim inspection series sampling manual when sampling tote bins use a sample scoop and dig into the product as far as possible in at least locations the sample drawn from each of the three locations may be considered as a sample unit for inspection and certification if each tote bin is a separate lot it may be composited as one sample unit if the lot consists of a group of tote bins sampling may be more representative with the use of a trier or thief which will penetrate deeply into each bin this implement should be constructed to permit sampling of the product from all levels in the bin if the product is a solid mass or if representative portions of the bin cannot be sampled the certificate should be flagged to indicate the extent of restricted sampling for restricted certification of tote bins see the aim inspection series certification manual sci division inspection series

procedures the order of examination for quality analytical and microanalyses is much the same for most products generally factors that are affected by exposure to the air are evaluated first such as color for some products such as jams jellies and applesauce consistency is the first consideration another general rule is to make the physical and organoleptic examination before analytical and micro tests cooking or any other tests that do not require the product to be intact or that would not be affected by the results of other testing familiarity with the product its grade standard and any additional grading instructions is essential in starting grading procedures the color factor is more critical in some products such as mushrooms and sweet potatoes but in all cases there is a tendency for product to become dull and somewhat darkened on exposure to air color should be evaluated soon as possible after the container is opened after obtaining net weights be alert for any abnormal product or container characteristics upon opening containers a in the case of dried fruits look for darkening sugaring etc b for jams and jellies check for mold in the head space area in low moisture fruits and fruit juice crystals or powder look for caking c for frozen product look for abnormal appearance color and or odor observe amount of frost ice crystals layer of ice dehydration shattered or broken units as in broccoli and asparagus d for canned product look for darkening in the head space area particularly with light colored products such as applesauce e also visually check the head space of canned fruits and vegetables often the actual measurement is unnecessary since the can is obviously filled to more than percent of its capacity as a general rule check the headspace of any sample units that have a low net weight or appear to have a low content level this is done easily with a head space gauge f after emptying cans to determine fill of container and or drained weight check metal cans for internal defects such as severe detinning or rust sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining net contents a definitions gross weight is the weight of the packaged unit including both the food and the primary container tare or tare weight is the weight of the empty clean dry primary container in which the food is packaged net weight is the difference between the gross weight and the tare weight it is the weight of the food itself including any packing medium b scales scale accuracy and sensitivity to one tenth of an ounce is adequate for most grading purposes in some instances greater sensitivity may be necessary for example it may be necessary to weigh small packages in gram units rather than ounces individual procedures for specific products will incorporate such requirements check scales frequently to verify that they are accurate and in proper working order a standardized weight or set of calibrated weights may be used for this purpose these weights must be kept clean and damage free and not used for routine weighing operations c rules for reading scales tares electronic scales can zero tare weights exactly if using a mechanical scale read to the higher mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and the weight of the tare can is between and ounces read the weight as ounces when the tare has been established the tare bar may be adjusted accordingly and the net weights can be read directly if there is no predetermined tare take gross weights first and determine the tare weight after containers are empty clean and dry record net weight by subtracting the tare weight from the gross weight gross net and drained weight read to the lower mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and if a package of asparagus weights between and ounces read as ounces d taking net weights place containers on the scale in the center of the pan for an accurate reading if there is any residue on the containers such as frost on the exterior surfaces of frozen food packages remove such material before weighing sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of e measuring net contents when the product is fluid in nature use the following methods to determine net contents or volume convert net weight to fluid ounces after determining net weights as indicated above convert to volume measurement with the following formula net weight oz x fill fl oz specific gravity degrees c example tomato juice no cylinder net weight ounces refractive index degrees c see aim inspection series technical procedures manual sucrose conversion table to obtain specific gravity specific gravity fill fl oz measuring flask glass flasks are available that are accurately calibrated for measuring volume of liquids the flask is calibrated for volume of a liquid at a standard temperature usually degrees c the legend is etched on each flask the fluid product being measured must be at this temperature for accuracy it is also important to avoid incorporating air into the liquid when filling the flask to do so always pour the liquid slowly down the side of the flask heavier products such as tomato juice nectars etc must stand after filling the flask to permit any trapped air to escape determining tare weight these procedures applies to all types of primary containers cans glass fiber etc except polyethylene or other thin plastic film when the weight of the primary container is quite uniform and is a very small percentage of the total gross weight in such uniform light weight poly bags a single bag from the lot may be used as the tare when the tare involves cartons the liquid from frozen products such as frozen sliced strawberries soaks into the fiber during the freezing period rather than using new or air dried cartons use soaked cartons wiped with a dry towel to determine the tare for such a lot sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a field office procedures option average tare wash dry and weigh empty containers from the lot subtract the smallest weight from

greater or greater b field office procedures option two heaviest if it is impractical or impossible to weigh the number of containers called for in the above table or if the applicant desires use the average weight of the heaviest of the containers as the tare c in plant inspection option average tare select at random empty containers and lids and weigh them collectively if possible use the average weight from these containers as the tare make this tare determination at least once per day normally early in the shift and again at any time there is a change in the supply of containers d in plant inspection option pre weighed tare weigh the tare containers and mark these containers with their respective weights or identify the containers with the tare weight recorded on the worksheet pass these pre weighed tare containers through the filler and capture them after a point where there is no further chance to alter the fill subtract the appropriate tare weight from the gross weight to determine the net weight of each container e in plant inspection option heaviest tare in some instances the plant may wish to use the heaviest of the weighed cans as tare or if in line control is based on subgroups of for example cans the heaviest of the may be used as the tare this option should only be used when the plant requests such restrictive control sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining drained weight tare a dry empty mesh sieve except use a mesh sieve for canned tomatoes use the inch diameter sieve for smaller capacity containers and the inch diameter sieve for larger containers rest one edge of the tared sieve on the side of a grading tray approximately inches deep this will produce a sieve slope angle of about to degrees distribute the product evenly on the screen except for canned spinach which is not spread on the screen drain for two minutes without disturbing the product except to invert halves of fruit that are obviously holding pockets of syrup at the end of two minutes place the sieve on the scale and read the drained weight directly to expedite grading and examination of the product it is ideal to have several sieves standardized to a particular weight this can be done through careful selection of sieves and the addition of solder or stainless steel washers and wire to increase the lighter sieves to the weight of the heaviest by using a single tare on the scale standardized sieve weights will allow multiple drained weight samples to be weighed sequentially at the end of the two minute draining period do not re tare the sieves after the first weighing any slight residue remaining on the mesh is considered a part of drained weight re taring the sieve would offset this small increment of weight however the sieve should be washed if there is excessive build up of material and syrup this is often seen when draining canned apples for example grade or compliance determination

sauce because the u s standards do not generally include sauces and garnishes as a part of product description misunderstandings have led to incorrect certification of such products as no applicable grade a policy division policy is to consider the u s standards for the principal item as applicable to those products packed with or in or seasoned with another ingredient consider the u s standards for both items as applicable to those products packed and another ingredient examples for frozen peas with onions the primary ingredient would be considered peas and the u s standards for frozen peas

the quality of various ingredients prior to mixing can be helpful under in plant inspection consideration should be given to the effect of the garnish or seasoning on the appearance and eating quality of the end item for example if lima beans are packed in butter sauce that has a rancid flavor which carries over into the end product certify the product as substandard example grade substandard

point where the physical characteristics and quality will not be altered by any further hand or mechanical means but may be subject to further processing such as final freezing line checks for grade determination are considered official samples they provide a record of what has happened during the packing shift they keep the inspector and the processor informed of conditions during processing and helps the processor keep quality at the desired level the number of line check samples examined will depend on the sampling plan in effect at a particular processing plant see the aim inspection series sampling manual for on line sampling procedures use approved score sheets and tally sheets for recording inspection results the ams forms catalog which may be found at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx contains a list of approved score sheets and tally sheets see the score sheet and tally sheet section of this manual for guidelines on the development approval and completion of plant specific score sheets whenever possible make samples available for examination by plant officials and supervisors after grading this affords the inspector an opportunity to discuss any pertinent observations or changes needed during production and encourages communication between all parties the plant supervisors and subordinate inspectors a line checks for grade determination of finished product samples of the finished product are taken after processing is complete and no further change in quality is likely to occur samples are selected on a random basis so that each sample unit has an equal chance of being selected if the production rate is reasonably uniform spaced sampling intervals during a set period of packing time will generally produce good lot representation if the rate of production fluctuates considerably the sampling interval should be adjusted accordingly regardless of production patterns inspectors must not be too predictable in their sampling intervals such predictability may allow for processor manipulation timed to temporarily improve the product at the anticipated sample selection time this may be more of a problem if the grading site is located far away from the processing lines and in view of the production workers line check personnel would be seen while on their way to draw samples in time for workers to intensify their efforts to improve quality the inspector s goal is to draw samples that accurately reflect the quality of the product and such samples are not representative of the lot samples of finished product should receive all the same processing and handling as the lot which they represent and should ideally be taken from the location of the stored lot if this is not practical due to the size of the facility or location of storage consult your supervisor for guidance sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b line checks of unprocessed product line checks of samples prior to final processing give the inspector and the processor an immediate picture of the likely finished product quality the processor can promptly implement correction procedures if needed to improve subsequent production these line checks are generally considered official samples that are used to help determine the final grade of the product since they are not processed all unprocessed line check sample units from the canning line must be opened immediately after the sample units are drawn samples drawn at this stage are limited in the extent to which they fully reflect finished product inspectors must examine samples of the finished product before assigning a final grade regardless of the number of line check samples evaluated samples of the finished product should be taken from the same location as the stored lot to ensure that they received the same processing and handling as the lot they represent in some cases this will not be practical especially in large canneries if not finished samples may be taken at the end of the processing line at proper intervals if needed consult your supervisor for guidance for a quality assurance or qap type contract only finished product is used for verifying reliability there are many important reasons for examining the finished product the lot is subject to further handling and processing after line checks are examined character in many products may be adversely affected by rough handling or overcooking canned foods may be overcooked or undercooked frozen foods may not be completely frozen the color of the product may deteriorate because of improper processing or may be improved by heat exchange and equalization oxidation and pinking will sometimes be prominent in certain products after processing even though not apparent in the raw product bruises in the raw product often diminish or disappear after heat processing frozen fruits may develop considerable oxidation between the line check and freezing operation adulteration by foreign material is possible if various fruit products are held too long in warm weather after sugaring and packaging higher mold counts may be found in samples after freezing than were found in line sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of check samples objectionable material may be introduced where packing medium is added at a point after line checks are taken improper cooling may cause external rust on canned foods soon after processing cooker jams or rough handling may dent many cans in the lot under certain conditions cans may panel or buckle after improper cooling after freezing and the resulting expansion frozen foods in packing media may show poor condition because of leakers liquid may soak through and discolor primary containers of some frozen foods if held too long in the containers before freezing dried foods may be excessively moist in containers with faulty seals it may be necessary to disregard line check indications and base the final grade of the product entirely on examination of finished product samples in this situation the line check score sheets should include an explanation about why they were considered unreliable c incomplete grade a final grade cannot be determined without finished product inspection if inspection results are only available from unprocessed line checks an incomplete grade ig may be established by supplementing line check results with any other factors affecting quality of which the inspector is aware experience with the product is the key to determining accurate incomplete grades products bearing approved identification must be completely inspected and assigned a final grade issue only incomplete grades on lots that have been shipped before finished product samples can be drawn unless official inspection can be completed at the point where the lots arrive never issue a final grade based on a few cases left from a lot that has been shipped unless the certificate covers only those few cases remaining if part of a lot is shipped before samples can be drawn assign an incomplete grade to the shipped portion and a final grade to the remaining portion noting complete details on the score sheets and daily inspection reports involved if sufficient finished product sample units are later examined from a lot previously assigned an incomplete grade and if they indicate lot quality to be higher or lower than the incomplete grade the final grade is based on the examination of finished product samples

been sorted out of the regular pack this is particularly true with rtp cherries strawberries and other berries although we do not wish to encourage this type of inspection we also have no grounds for refusing to inspect a product according to u s standards quite often the question is whether the grade should be substandard or whether the product is gnc or there may be a buyer specification and we need to determine if the product meets that specification for these situations use the following guidelines a be sure to check the product for foreign material as indicated in the aim inspection series foreign material manual b even if the product meets the buyer s specification it should also be on hold for re examination account foreign material where examination for filth indicates the product might exceed the guidelines then proceed in accordance with aim inspection series foreign material manual c if the product is frozen in bulk such as barrels certification and inspection should be restricted to that portion of the containers from which the sample is drawn d do not show mold counts or rot counts or actual numerical results of any filth examination on the certificate e do not restrict foreign material examination to one factor such as mold count leaving other applicable filth analyses undetermined reporting results a reporting inspection results it s crucial to report result to the plant in a timely manner to the processor this is one of the main advantages of having in plant inspection plant employees designated to receive reports must be identified for new inspectors an individual line check sample that is below desired quality should be reported immediately to the designated plant contact so he or she may take any necessary corrective action this person is usually a qa or qc manager or technician it s a good policy to note on the line check sheet both the name of the plant contact and the time the notification was given after verbal reporting written notification is usually provided to the plant in three ways notification to the designated plant contact person immediately after results are obtained the inspector should establish a daily routine for sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of reporting grading results to the person responsible for placing lots into storage for example writing the grade of each item packed on the warehouse manager s copy of the pack report or plant production report copies of the score sheets if desired copies of the daily inspection report b reporting special cases products that are grade not certified or fail fda standards or fail requirements pertaining to the use of approved identification on the label marks all require special reporting procedures the plant will want to prevent recurrence and to make sure these items are not inadvertently shipped or mixed with like items in the warehouse a letter should be written to the responsible plant official according to division regulations the designated plant individual responsible for hold disposition should sign the letter and enter the date received four copies of the letter should be made with the plant retaining the original the inspector shall make the prescribed departmental distribution on the remainder of the copies see hold and release instructions in this manual in the case

equipment at all times safety first b inspection of products processed elsewhere there may be times when plant management purchases a processed fruit or vegetable for resale or further processing the inspector should honor an occasional request by the plant to inspect and or certify such a product provided that the product was not officially inspected before there should be no additional charge for this service unless the inspector s workday is lengthened in the process however if the plant inspector is not proficient in grading the product or if the plant facilities lack necessary

natural sugars in the fruit and sugars in the in going packing medium for the inspection purposes of canned fruits in syrup equalization is considered complete days after packing however rather than delay inspection for the day time needed for this process equalization may be achieved by comminuting all of the product and all of the packing medium together this is known as simulated equalization see the brix section in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual for additional information on simulated equalization procedures sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of simulated equalization compliance of each item with a specified syrup designation shall be determined on a shift basis on samples drawn at regular intervals entire individual containers must be blended for each determination a sampling sample units may be drawn from the processing line at any point after the seaming operation and preferably where they emerge from the cooking and cooling operation samples for simulated equalization may be obtained as follows the same container that is used for grade determination may be used for brix determination if all fruit and syrup can be retrieved for comminuting after quality factors have been determined loss of either fruit or syrup component will lead to inaccurate results separate containers may be drawn from the line for brix determination only b sampling frequency the sampling frequency for brix determination is based on the required number of sample units needed to meet the on line sampling rate in the regulations and knowledge of previous production at least three determinations must be made refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual for information regarding time sampling plans that cover non quality factors sampling frequency shall be as follows low volume one sample unit per to minutes medium volume one sample unit per minutes high volume one sample unit per minutes no change in sampling frequency is necessary unless production for three consecutive basic production periods production shift indicates a change from one volume designation to another c sub group samples if

shown in acceptance criteria on the following page d lateral samples lateral samples may be drawn at the option of the plant however these samples may be used only for the plant s guidance or to confirm rejection of a lot they may not be used to determine compliance with the average specified as shown under acceptance criteria e sampling failed lots if a lot fails because of low average brix or insufficient sample units less than minimum number required the lot may be rejected however the packer has the option to request that additional containers be drawn throughout the lot to make up to at least the minimum required for on line in plant inspection if the inspector elects to draw more than this minimum it shall be in increments as outlined in the regulations i e f general procedure record the net weights when line samples are in the laboratory this information may be valuable to the processor since to some extent low or high net weights influence the final brix readings cool the samples to approximately degrees f before opening if they are available use several blender bowls to save time in comminuting multiple samples designate each bowl for use on those products that are consistently close in degrees brix after one sample unit is comminuted it may be poured back into its original container the bowl should be completely drained before another sample unit is comminuted continue this procedure until all containers are blended and the comminuted product s is ready for refractometer readings leave the bowls inverted after brix measurements have been completed or wash with hot water and thoroughly dry before each use g communication when a brix determination is below the required value immediately notify the proper designated plant official record the name of this plant employee and the time of notification on work sheet or score sheet sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of if requested check additional blends and record these additional values in a separate column on blend sheet or work sheet these would be considered lateral samples and cannot be used to erase results of official samples day equalization to bring a lot up to date fifteen days or more after pack measure the brix on all sample units using techniques described in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual incorporate these readings with the original blend readings if they confirm the original results if these readings fail to confirm the original results make a full inspection for brix at the appropriate single sampling rate and certify on this basis disregarding the readings obtained by simulated equalization acceptance criteria a code or group of codes may be considered separately from other codes in a shift if it meets the full single sampling rate to be considered acceptable the re sampled portion must meet the requirements listed below portions that fail to meet these requirements are rejected a simulated

plant inspectors filing system a list of key management and plant personnel names should be kept on file for ready access by new inspection personnel since title and structure of management levels differ between plants the lists may vary accordingly the form and style should be based on plant management structure and chain of command include names of plant contact individuals on each shift since many inspectors go from plant to plant it is important that the filing systems be relatively uniform to minimize confusion for inspectors this system consists of two basic parts a yearly file and a permanent file in many plants these files may be adequately housed in a single file drawer larger plants requiring a greater number of records may need a three drawer filing cabinet whatever type of storage is used it must be lockable the iic is allowed flexibility in establishing these files the inspector only needs to set up folders for those topics applying to the particular plant and arrange them in the given sequence the letter and number of each folder enables the inspector to return it to the current filing location easily tab the folders with the approximate terminology as

usda grade or inspection marks when reviewing product manufacturer labels the inspector must check for all issues that are required under the inspection agreement with industry contract if a state or federal statute requires certain label information and requires that product meet certain criteria for their special mark the inspector s review should include these criteria any deviations should be reported to plant management inspectors should not enter into any discussion or controversy over label statements that are under mandatory labeling regulations such as under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or applicable state laws and regulations however inspectors should be aware of any incidences of potentially deceptive or inaccurate labeling if you are directly aware of such an incident through knowledge of the plant s processes report it to your supervisor if processors distributors or others in private industry have questions about proper labeling they should be tactfully referred to the agency usually fda with authority on the subject for further label information see the labeling section of this manual although the national office approves the use of official label marks by the applicant the iic of a plant will be responsible for reviewing and verifying all labeling materials bearing approved identification questions or problems that cannot be resolved are to be directed through the normal chain of command when labels are completed and available at the plant they should be reviewed as far in advance of use as possible the ideal situation would be to review preliminary label sketches paste ups or proofs of proposed labels before they are manufactured this step could prevent significant errors and save the firm considerable expense and inconvenience whether materials are checked prior to manufacture or not inspectors should be sure to verify finished labels because there may have been changes since the initial review products packed or certified under contract in plant or lot inspection may bear certain types of approved identification these products must meet the requirements stated in the regulations and additional qualifications set forth within in plant

with significant changes in the processing facilities the pack reflects a much higher proportion of better grades this same trend is indicated generally from other canneries and as a result the marketing of this year s pack is not expected to be as severely impacted by off grade merchandise as last year s the market for elbertas continues to be unsatisfactory however due largely to continued efforts to move the heavy carry overs of the year pack kadota figs the canning operations on kadota figs commenced on october but were curtailed by difficulties in attending the harvest in the latter stages of the season lower than normal temperatures and cool nights together with water shortages have resulted in a sharp overall drop off in production this in turn caused abnormally small sizes and below average quality as a result the final production fell below pre season expectations one problem encountered in the first weeks of processing was the heavy infestation of the raw product by dried fruit beetles this contamination was caused by poor field and harvesting methods by the farmer as a result of this condition the inspector found it necessary to suggest stringent changes in preliminary washing procedures management cooperated fully and after these improvements were made there were no further problems with the finished product sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of iv products processed cont tomatoes varying conditions in various producing areas of the state resulted in a rather confused picture for early production prospects it was evident that many of the older producing areas had experienced substantial reductions in acreage due largely to the unavailability or high rental of suitable land on the other hand major acreage expansion was reported in the westfield valley where new land was being put into production the cannery started production on the first of september but as the season progressed deliveries were not sufficient to permit continuous operations one of the features of the tomato operation was the gallon drum filling installation this facility fills each of the four drums with approximately pounds of percent solid tomato paste every minutes v sanitation general appearance and housekeeping the past year was exceptionally good the usual problems of running around the clock on certain products were encountered but generally speaking the sanitation and clean up was good the plant improved the sanitation condition of the plant because of three factors the first one was the message passed down the chain of command concerning the crucial role of good plant sanitation as well as the management of a plant sanitation program an effective program was implemented and plant employees did their parts to make it work the second factor was the installation and use of a multi drop high pressure low volume kobe pumping system throughout the processing area this helped keep hand cleaning down to a minimum and also reduced the cleaning time necessary for each area the third factor was the two shift approximately nine hour schedule that was maintained during the fruit processing season this allowed a clean up crew ample time to properly clean the plant vi major changes of facilities and equipment general installation of new boiler installation of three rotary type

the can some monitoring of the legibility of the code was necessary with adjustments made when needed the plant was made aware of the inkjet type system of coding to increase legibility this could be a more accurate method to help track inventory more precisely handling and warehousing of the finished product was efficient even though the company added warehouses two years ago anticipation of a bumper crop and inventory called for the use of outside storage of their product their storage and code tracking methods allow separate tracking of all five individual production lines sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of viii application of u s standards and inspector s instructions asparagus and figs no particular problem in applying the standards and instructions peaches the standards are difficult to apply with respect to grade d and below standards in quality specifically application of the off suture cut tolerance and uniformity

except that no provisions are made for stemmed instructions should increase the tolerance on sprouted seeds on page no standards for chopped tomatoes with basil copy of buyer s specifications for the product attached approximately cases packed ix miscellaneous with the introduction of the can dispensing units this year the overall coding system for the cannery was improved by using a basic type die mark and different combinations of side marks the cook room could better utilize the full capacity of their cookers it also proved to be more efficient in the warehouse as a mere glance at the uncased merchandise could determine its particular style grade etc x housing for inspectors the plant is located approximately miles from the city limits where there are several hotels and restaurants available at moderate rates the most affordable accommodations are at a motel located a half mile from the plant the motel has been recently renovated and complies with the federal fire and safety act

on labels using official marks will be brought to the processor s attention as will questionable labels observed in the course of inspection depending upon the nature of the deviation corrective action may be recommended or required various additives are sometimes used in the preparation of non standardized processed foods these additives such as acids salt sugar approved colorings calcium lactate etc are usually used during the manufacturing process for example some frozen vegetables may pass through brine separators during processing and accumulate trace amounts of salt in the finished product similarly citric acid may be used in the manufacture of canned apple sauce other examples include additives such as sugar coloring and calcium lactate sometimes used during the processing of french fried potatoes the use of these substances can pose a labeling problem because of the method of application the additive s may carry over to the finished product in negligible quantities this may seem to be inconsequential however since many of these products are not standardized under food and drug labeling requirements it is necessary to declare each ingredient including additives when used it is the responsibility of the packer to conform to fda requirements sci approval of labels with official marks does not relieve the company of this responsibility we will not

accurate computations and assuring that all tests have been completed each grader will print and sign his her name on the score sheet s or tally sheet s the utmost care and diligence must be observed in the preparation of these official documents in the case of legal action inspectors may be subpoenaed by the court to testify to the accuracy of the score sheet tally sheet or resulting inspection certificate on which their signatures appear everyone from those who collect the data during inspection to those who are responsible for reviewing the work shares the responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of these documents a completing standardized score sheets and tally sheets sci policy is to record in the appropriate blocks on the score sheet or tally sheet the results of quantitative examinations analytical tests and actual quality level s observed during the grading of the product in variable grade point standards score sheets are used to assess product the overall quality factors are assigned a number and the final grade is determined in attribute standards a tally sheet is used to assess product prerequisite quality factors are examined quality factors are counted and the final grade is determined note when information that is common to both types of documents is described in this instruction the documents will be referred to as score tally sheets a thoroughly

weight or net contents country of origin and packers and or distributor s name and address additional printed data may be added to score tally sheets as long as the original score tally sheet data and format has not been altered it may be helpful to prepare a sort of template score tally sheet with added information for frequent applicants labels or other information verify this with your supervisor before preparing photocopying and using these templates with their pre printed information can be a time saver however if the score tally sheet has pre printed information added this information must be verified before continuing you must check to make sure that none of the information has changed since the score tally sheet template was prepared label information should be recorded exactly as found on the label if a container has extensive label markings and it is not possible to attach a label label markings may be shown on the reverse of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in the label section of the score tally sheet stating that label marks are listed on the reverse side it is permissible to write in the label section of the score tally sheet the

logically alphabetically numerically and or chronologically this ensures that like codes are grouped together and codes are easier to track when transferred to the score tally sheet record code markings in the row titled container mark or identification within this row there are two separate rows identified as primary and case see the example above the u s standards for condition of food containers defines the primary container as the immediate container in which the product is packaged and which serves to protect preserve and maintain the condition of the product it may be metal glass fiber wood textile plastic paper or any other suitable type of material and may be supplemented by liners overwraps or other protective materials the case would then be considered the container in which the primary container is packaged in the case of bulk packed products the case may be the primary container as for example processed raisins in pound cases the case code marks for such products would be recorded in the area designated for primary codes there would be no entry for case codes accurately record the code markings on the score tally sheet code markings are to be recorded exactly as they are written on the container refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual and certification manual for examples of how to record code marks and allowable exceptions all marks and spaces have a significant meaning in the code and should be accurately recorded on the score tally sheet if a code includes a time designation or marking it must be recorded if the color of the ink used is part of the code marks record the color of the ink when repeating identical code marks use arrows to show sample units in the lot that have the identical primary or case code markings this is the only area on the score tally sheet that arrows may be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when codes contain excessive numbers letters or symbols and are too long to be legibly written within the space provided on the score tally sheet the codes may be shown on the reverse side codes will be identified by sample number and listed left to right just as they would appear on the front of the score tally sheet in the row entitled container mark or identification if there is only one code in the lot that exceeds the space provided on the score tally sheet the code may be written in the remarks section whenever a code mark is written anywhere other than in the container mark or identification section of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in that section indicating where the code s is listed example container mark or identification primary code marks on reverse side of score sheet case corrections when an entry on a score tally sheet requires correction the only approved method is to draw a single line through the error write the correct entry next to the error and initial the correction white out is not allowed if the date of the correction is different from the date of the score tally sheet show the date of the correction example recording data follow the directions as shown in aim inspection series technical procedures manual which references procedures for recording weights vacuum readings and headspace when recording analytical data on the score tally sheet use the correct units of measure for

the following guidance is intended to assist policy writers to develop policy documents and should be read in conjunction with the policy document template summary table all the important information relating to the policy should be displayed at the top of the policy document so that it is easily accessible for the reader this information should include the policy title date of approval effective date date for review name of the policy officer policy title where possible the first word of the title should refer to the substance of the policy this will assist the reader access the policy from the policy a z e g accreditation of prior learning policy rather than policy on the accreditation of prior learning structure information should be presented in a logical sequence to assist the reader policy writers should use the section structure provided within the template but may create sub headings if necessary context may contain some contextual or background information and may include a sentence on how the policy supports the university s strategic plan definitions if necessary include an explanation of terms or abbreviations used within the policy and procedure where there are existing definitions of the terms in other university regulations or policy those definitions should be used purpose a concise statement on why the policy exists and what is its intent this statement should not contain background information or detailed explanations and should be suitable to act as a summary for viewing on the policy a z prior to the user reviewing the whole document scope specify the parameters of the policy which university cohort does the policy apply to this section should also reference any exclusions from the operation of the policy policy principles principles should provide broad directional information and the rationale for the policy by embodying the university s expected outcomes of its application roles and responsibilities some policies may require the articulation of roles to be undertaken by those responsible for applying the policy outline the university s expectations and detail the responsibilities of relevant parties process optional detailed operational procedures are separate from policy documents however some procedural information may be appropriately provided in the policy document particularly with regard to academic decision making policy toolkit guidelines for completion of policy documents document management policy documents and appendices are structured and presented consistently using the policy document template document control during the development stage there may be a number of people contributing to the development of a draft policy and so document version control is very important it is the responsibility of the policy officer to keep track of the developing drafts of the document via a continuously updated master document version numbers should be used to signify each revised version of the draft and a record of summarised revisions should be kept by the policy officer document version history all policy documents should include a comprehensive revision list at the end of the document this should chart the formal approval route and note any changes proposed by university committees this version history should remain on the published policy document and be updated following any subsequent changes to the policy style when drafting policy documents it is useful to bear in mind that different audiences are likely to access the policy and that policy users are not necessarily subject matter experts and may be accessing information on a topic for the first time it is important that policy documents are written in a clear and concise manner using plain english and avoiding jargon to ensure consistency of style and presentation those drafting policy documents are asked to consider the following use the policy document template use plain english and simple short sentences main headings and paragraphs should be numbered sequentially to facilitate referencing policy should be directive in style and therefore words such as will and must are appropriate to create a recognisable identity for policy documents a uniform format should be used font arial headings in bold and paragraphs separated by one line space policies should be as succinct as possible

are transferred between bank accounts approved transfer documents are authorised and maintained on the treasury file transactions are denoted daily on the daily cash sheets the treasury management spreadsheet is updated on a monthly basis for accrued interest amounts deposit control accounts are prepared on a monthly basis by the finance administrator and approved by the financial controller on a monthly basis confirmation of deposits received from the bank are compared to the deposit control account spreadsheet on a monthly basis and issues identified are queried by the finance administrator and the relevant bank on maturity all deposit interest figures are calculated and verified with relevant banks all queries in relation to any deposit interest calculation are clarified directly with the bank the financial system is updated on a monthly basis for interest received in the relevant month interest accruals are posted at the end of each financial year borrowings borrowing guaranteeing and underwriting shall be in carried out in accordance with the framework for borrowing and loan guarantees laid down in the code of governance for irish universities the university will ensure that all borrowing and loan transactions take place in accordance with the objects and functions of the university and the university s strategic plan in addition the level of borrowing shall not impinge on the university s ability to meet its annual servicing cost nor its ability to maintain financial and operational viability any proposals for long term borrowing for funding of projects will be evaluated by the bursar in line with the university s financial plan and the objectives of this policy and will not be undertaken without an express decision of the governing authority it will normally be expected that several sources of funds will be evaluated in each case appropriate interest rate hedging through fixed rates caps and other non aggressive instruments will be undertaken to protect the university from sharp increases in interest rates on borrowings any subsequent refinancing of a borrowing arrangement will be considered if the terms are competitive and as favourable as can reasonably be achieved in the light of market conditions prevailing at the time and will require approval by the governing authority in exceptional circumstances projects may be funded or part funded from cash balances held by the university in these instances an appropriate interest rate shall be repayable as approved by the governing authority following consideration by the university executive and the appropriate sub committee of the governing authority in striking an interest rate in these circumstances the governing authority will have regard to the feasibility of the project the loss of commercial deposit interest receivable and the long term financial sustainability of the university electronic fund transfers the university s long term strategy is to complete all transactions via electronic banking and eliminate all cheque transactions and minimise cash transactions where electronic payments occur all transfers and direct debit payments will only be initiated and authorised by mandated personnel supporting documentation will be retained where moneys are received by the university via electronic means e g realex mycard etc relevant finance office personnel will perform monthly reconciliations of bank accounts and control accounts to ensure that monetary amounts are reconciled agreed to supporting documentation where available and posted to the appropriate ledger account incoming cash and cheques until such time as cash and cheques are eliminated any cheques received through the mail and opened by the bursars office are forwarded to the income fees office any cash receivable into a department outside of the bursars income office should be remitted to income fees office indicating a reference to a relevant business unit with relevant dockets from a departmental remittance book cash receipts should be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation only irish drafts postal orders euro cheques or cash should be accepted foreign drawn cheques incur substantial collection fees which may make them uneconomical to lodge daily cash sheets are maintained to indicate the summary of all cash lodgments to the bank cash received through mycard vending machines is collected twice weekly by an outside cash handling security company and lodged directly into the mycard current bank account banking of other cash and cheques should be done at least twice a week foreign exchange generally the university will seek to keep transactions involving foreign currency to a minimum and will seek wherever possible to have transactions conducted in euro rather than foreign currency the university will not hold foreign currency except in the anticipation of related expenditure or onward payment for currencies where there are both extensive purchases and sales the university will keep under review whether to open foreign currency bank accounts in order to reduce transaction costs where external service providers are appointed in relation to foreign exchange transactions their work will be checked by the finance team in all circumstances the university will retain full responsibility for day to day treasury matters and for the safeguarding of its funds

products are re inspected in order to issue either an up to date certificate or an appeal certificate frequently the applicant doesn t question the quality and condition of the lot but needs a current certificate in order to satisfy a buyer seller contract occasionally the quality of previously inspected merchandise is questioned by a financially interested party and they request an appeal inspection inspection certificates are accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts contained within although it is division policy to assign only one grade representing a specific lot as a whole there have been cases involving the perishable agricultural commodities act paca in which both the plaintiff and defendant produced usda certificates each with a different grade it is very difficult to settle such claims unless the grade on one certificate can be reversed there should be no conflicting certificates on the lot unless the quality of the lot has changed due to age storage handling or other condition factors if such a change has taken place the original certificate is valid for the date of original inspection and the later certificate is also valid for the date of the later inspection these instructions will address such situations a formal appeal inspections if possible formal appeal inspections should be discouraged an appeal may often be avoided by having the inspector or supervisor review a few samples of the product with the applicant he or she can explain why the sample units were assigned a certain grade or why certain factors were evaluated as they were if the applicant requests a formal appeal the inspection should be handled as outlined in the regulations for appeal inspections these instructions supplement the regulations filing for appeal an appeal inspection may be requested by any financially interested party who is not satisfied with the results of the inspection as represented by a certificate on the lot in question they may file for an appeal provided a the lot of processed products can be identified as the same lot previously inspected b the request is within days of the previous inspection this period may be extended by the regional or national offices and c the complaint concerns a factor s which would not be a result of a change in a condition factor s since the previous inspection see section below sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the division will issue an appeal certificate when it has been established that the previous inspection is in error the original certificate is reversed and copies of the appeal certificate are sent to all financially interested parties denying request for appeal requests for an appeal inspection may be denied under the following circumstances a the complaint concerns a factor which may have undergone a change of condition since the original inspection such as oxidation of frozen fruits severe de tinning of apple sauce or other canned product hydrogen swells or other types of spoilage frozen broccoli or asparagus spears that are shattered due to possible mishandling flavor deterioration of canned citrus juice due to long storage at high temperatures and severe dehydration of frozen vegetables b the lot cannot be identified c the first inspection certification was based on restricted sampling for an example of a certificate showing restricted sampling see the aim inspection series certification manual d code marks do not agree with the original inspection e count does not agree with the original certificate there are certain exceptions to this provision if the original certificate covered a large lot and the re inspection covers a substantial quantity of merchandise an appeal on a portion of the original certificate may be granted provided that there is no question about identity however an appeal would not be granted on a very small segment of the original quantity for example if the quantity would be substantially less than the quantity represented by a single sample unit on the original inspection f lot is not accessible for proper sampling g if there has been a revision to the grade standards between the two sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of inspections and such revision would affect the grade assigned to the product h the original certificate is grade not certified gnc account unsanitary conditions of the plant or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material for example a frog or mouse may be found in a container during the original inspection plant conditions may warrant a gnc certificate even though this incident is strictly accidental it would be most unlikely that a re inspection of the lot would find another frog or mouse however the division would not deem it advisable to completely ignore previous production or inspection history and reverse the original inspection certificate i reasons for appeal are inadequate or frivolous for example i just don t trust the inspectors in the location office j when it is not in the interest of usda to perform the appeal this is a broad category and the national office would need to evaluate all facts in order to render an appropriate decision even if denied an appeal inspection due to any of these reasons the applicant may request a re inspection or an up to date inspection on the lot in question the result of this new inspection would establish the grade of the lot except that no grade would be assigned if usda records show that the original certificate was gnc account unsanitary processing conditions or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material see h above performing the appeal a information required the application may be made orally or in writing if made orally it must be confirmed in writing it must include the location of the lot the reason s for the appeal the date and serial number of the certificate covering the original inspection of the product and the name of issuing office sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b sampling the sampling rate on an appeal inspection should be at least the next sample size larger than the normal sampling rate for the lot size based on the single sampling plan in other words if the sample size in the regulations would normally be for the size of lot involved at least sample units would be drawn on the same lot for an appeal inspection if the applicant merely requests an up to date inspection and it is not known until the sample is examined that an appeal is in order as determined by the division the certificate should not be issued until additional sample units are drawn since stratification can occur in large containers at least a portion of samples of bulk container lots such as pound frozen should be full containers for example frozen strawberries may contain rocks that would tend to settle to the bottom of the can during handling prior to freezing a subsample from the top or center of the can is not likely to reveal the presence of this type of foreign material c who may perform the appeal inspection any inspector other than the inspector who performed the original inspection may perform an appeal inspection whenever practical two inspectors who are thoroughly familiar with the product should be assigned to conduct the appeal if one inspector starts the inspection and the need to issue an appeal inspection certificate doesn t become evident until the inspection is partially complete a second inspector should be called in to confirm the results d notify the regional and national offices if a formal appeal is filed or if during a routine re inspection procedure it appears that an appeal is in order notify the regional and national offices they may require a few samples to verify the new inspection results e examination of product because of the economic significance of the appeal all samples of the product should be very carefully graded and checked for all factors if objective tests are available they should be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of f gnc ordinarily an appeal would not be granted because of unsanitary plant or product conditions where the original inspection findings make an appeal unjustified see h on page fees a appeal fees are as follows grade sustained charge regular fee plus expenses grade reversed no charge for inspection but charge applicant for expenses incurred in sampling or shipping samples note an appeal certificate reversing the original inspection can only be issued after receiving authority from the national office if the inspection results indicate that this is the case submit details to the regional office the regional office will confer with the national office before results are reported or a certificate is issued certification see the aim inspection series certification manual for specific information related to the certification of appeals and re inspections sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of bulk containers frozen products packed in used containers used pound metal and or plastic containers with friction type lids are refilled by some processors of frozen foods reused containers must be clean at time of refilling obtain a letter of conformance from the processor stating that the containers were not previously used for non food products products filled into unsanitary containers are to be classed as grade not certified gnc it may be difficult to accurately describe reused containers some of these may have been used several times and appear to be old abused or otherwise damaged they may bear an assortment of code marks and label statements certification statements regarding used containers may be found in the aim inspection series certification manual note reused containers are not acceptable for government purchases state federal and department of defense unless specified in the contract or solicitation do not certify without a written waiver unless specified in the contract tote bins many packers use large bulk containers called tote bins for frozen vegetables these bins are used during the packing season to store frozen vegetables for repack at a later date the bins vary in size and construction but can hold as much as a ton of product for financial reasons users of tote bins need to know whether or not the product is free flowing or frozen in a solid mass the type of pack should always be shown in the body of the inspection certificate a free flowing describes a pack in which the individual units of the pack are not frozen together in a solid mass but may be easily separated into individual units there may be some crusting on the interior surface of the tote bin or a few clumps of units frozen together within the container but these can be separated with moderate pressure b solid mass describes a pack in which the individual units of the product in the container are predominantly or entirely frozen together in a solid mass such product will require additional cost in repacking the product due a special break up step in the process for the purpose of inspection and certification a lot can be a group of tote bins or a single tote bin tote bins must be properly identified for future re inspection segregation etc codes should be at least inch in height and stamped on the tote bins or on tags placed in upper right or left hand corner of the side normally facing the fork lift driver the area for applying the codes may be painted to facilitate application and legibility sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the coding system may include the following plant when more than plant is operated by the same company quality designation date of pack day month and year product type style size etc when not readily apparent such as covered bins or numerous product styles period shift or lot number bin numbers special notation of abnormal quality variations i e grade b for color only etc different colored tape tags or marking ink for different quality levels or other special notations to determine the sampling rate for an item packed in tote bins or bulk storage the poundage is converted to institutional size pound containers using the number of pound containers the lot would represent refer to the regulations or the aim inspection series sampling manual when sampling tote bins use a sample scoop and dig into the product as far as possible in at least locations the sample drawn from each of the three locations may be considered as a sample unit for inspection and certification if each tote bin is a separate lot it may be composited as one sample unit if the lot consists of a group of tote bins sampling may be more representative with the use of a trier or thief which will penetrate deeply into each bin this implement should be constructed to permit sampling of the product from all levels in the bin if the product is a solid mass or if representative portions of the bin cannot be sampled the certificate should be flagged to indicate the extent of restricted sampling for restricted certification of tote bins see the aim inspection series certification manual sci division inspection series

procedures the order of examination for quality analytical and microanalyses is much the same for most products generally factors that are affected by exposure to the air are evaluated first such as color for some products such as jams jellies and applesauce consistency is the first consideration another general rule is to make the physical and organoleptic examination before analytical and micro tests cooking or any other tests that do not require the product to be intact or that would not be affected by the results of other testing familiarity with the product its grade standard and any additional grading instructions is essential in starting grading procedures the color factor is more critical in some products such as mushrooms and sweet potatoes but in all cases there is a tendency for product to become dull and somewhat darkened on exposure to air color should be evaluated soon as possible after the container is opened after obtaining net weights be alert for any abnormal product or container characteristics upon opening containers a in the case of dried fruits look for darkening sugaring etc b for jams and jellies check for mold in the head space area in low moisture fruits and fruit juice crystals or powder look for caking c for frozen product look for abnormal appearance color and or odor observe amount of frost ice crystals layer of ice dehydration shattered or broken units as in broccoli and asparagus d for canned product look for darkening in the head space area particularly with light colored products such as applesauce e also visually check the head space of canned fruits and vegetables often the actual measurement is unnecessary since the can is obviously filled to more than percent of its capacity as a general rule check the headspace of any sample units that have a low net weight or appear to have a low content level this is done easily with a head space gauge f after emptying cans to determine fill of container and or drained weight check metal cans for internal defects such as severe detinning or rust sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining net contents a definitions gross weight is the weight of the packaged unit including both the food and the primary container tare or tare weight is the weight of the empty clean dry primary container in which the food is packaged net

is adequate for most grading purposes in some instances greater sensitivity may be necessary for example it may be necessary to weigh small packages in gram units rather than ounces individual procedures for specific products will incorporate such requirements check scales frequently to verify that they are accurate and in proper working order a standardized weight or set of calibrated

weights exactly if using a mechanical scale read to the higher mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and the weight of the tare can is between and ounces read the weight as ounces when the tare has been established the tare bar may be adjusted accordingly and the net weights can be read directly if there is no predetermined tare take gross weights first and determine the tare weight after containers are empty clean and dry record net weight by subtracting the tare weight from the gross weight gross net and drained weight read to the lower mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and if a package of asparagus weights between and ounces read as ounces d taking net weights place containers on the scale in the center of the pan for an accurate reading if there is any residue on the containers such as frost on the exterior surfaces of frozen food packages remove such material before weighing sci division inspection series general procedures

available that are accurately calibrated for measuring volume of liquids the flask is calibrated for volume of a liquid at a standard temperature usually degrees c the legend is etched on each flask the fluid product being measured must be at this temperature for accuracy it is also important to avoid incorporating air into the liquid when filling the flask to do so always pour the liquid slowly down the side of the flask heavier products such as tomato juice nectars etc must stand after filling the flask to permit any trapped air to escape determining tare weight these procedures applies to all types of primary containers cans glass fiber etc except polyethylene or other thin plastic film when the weight of the primary container is quite uniform and is a very small percentage of the total gross weight in such uniform light weight poly bags a single bag from the lot may be used as the tare when the tare involves cartons the liquid from frozen products such as frozen sliced strawberries soaks into the fiber during the freezing period rather than using new or air dried cartons use soaked cartons wiped with a dry towel to determine the tare for such a lot sci division

average weight of the heaviest of the containers as the tare c in plant inspection option average tare select at random empty containers and lids and weigh them collectively if possible use the average weight from these containers as the tare make this tare determination at least once per day normally early in the shift and again at any time there is a change in the supply of containers d in plant inspection option pre weighed tare weigh the tare containers and mark these containers with their respective weights or identify the containers with the tare weight recorded on the worksheet pass these pre weighed tare containers through the filler and capture them after a point where there is no further chance to alter the fill subtract the appropriate tare weight from the gross weight to determine the net weight of each container e in plant inspection option heaviest tare in some instances the plant may wish to use the heaviest of the weighed cans as tare or if in line control is based on subgroups of for example cans the heaviest of the may be used as the tare this option should only be used when the plant requests such restrictive control sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining drained weight tare a dry empty mesh sieve except use a mesh sieve for canned tomatoes use the inch diameter sieve for smaller capacity containers and the inch diameter sieve for larger containers rest one edge of the tared sieve on the side of a grading tray approximately inches deep this will produce a sieve slope angle of about to degrees distribute the product evenly on the screen except for canned spinach which is not spread on the screen drain for two minutes without disturbing the product except to invert halves of fruit that are obviously holding pockets of syrup at the end of two minutes place the sieve on the scale and read the drained weight directly to expedite grading and examination of the product it is ideal to have several sieves standardized to a particular weight this can be done through careful selection of sieves and the addition of solder or stainless steel washers and wire to increase the lighter sieves to the weight of the heaviest by using a single tare on the scale standardized sieve weights will allow multiple drained weight samples to be weighed sequentially at the end of the two minute draining period do not re tare the sieves after the first weighing any slight residue remaining on the mesh is considered a part of drained weight re taring the sieve would offset this small increment of weight however the sieve should be washed if there is excessive build up of material and syrup this is often seen when draining canned apples for example grade or compliance determination when inspection for quality is based on any u s grade standard with a scoring system there is an allowance for samples that fall below the quality of the indicated grade lot sizes range from sample

point where the physical characteristics and quality will not be altered by any further hand or mechanical means but may be subject to further processing such as final freezing line checks for grade determination are considered official samples they provide a record of what has happened during the packing shift they keep the inspector and the processor informed of conditions during processing and helps the processor keep quality at the desired level the number of line check samples examined will depend on the sampling plan in effect at a particular processing plant see the aim inspection series sampling manual for on line sampling procedures use approved score sheets and tally sheets for recording inspection results the ams forms catalog which may be found at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx contains a list of approved score sheets and tally sheets see the score sheet and tally sheet section of this manual for guidelines on the development approval and completion of plant specific score sheets whenever possible make samples available for examination by plant officials and supervisors after grading this affords the inspector an opportunity to discuss any pertinent observations or changes needed during production and encourages communication between all parties the plant supervisors and subordinate inspectors a line checks for grade determination of finished product samples of the finished product are taken after processing is complete and no further change in quality is likely to occur samples are selected on a random basis so that each sample unit has an equal chance of being selected if the production rate is reasonably uniform spaced sampling intervals during a set period of packing time will generally produce good lot representation if the rate of production fluctuates considerably the sampling interval should be adjusted accordingly regardless of production patterns inspectors must not be too predictable in their sampling intervals such predictability may allow for processor manipulation timed to temporarily improve the product at the anticipated sample selection time this may be more of a problem if the grading site is located far away from the processing lines and in view of the production workers line check personnel would be seen while on their way to draw samples in time for workers to intensify their efforts to improve quality the inspector s goal is to draw samples that accurately reflect the quality of the product and such samples are not representative of the lot samples of finished product should receive all the same processing and handling as the lot which they represent and should ideally be taken from the location of the stored lot if this is not practical due to the size of the facility or location of storage consult your supervisor for guidance sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b line checks of unprocessed product line checks of samples prior to final processing give the inspector and the processor an immediate picture of the likely finished product quality the processor can promptly implement correction procedures if needed to improve subsequent production these line checks are generally considered official samples that are used to help determine the final grade of the product since they are not processed all unprocessed line check sample units from the canning line must be opened immediately after the sample units are drawn samples drawn at this stage are limited in the extent to which they fully reflect finished product inspectors must examine samples of the finished product before assigning a final grade regardless of the number of line check samples evaluated samples of the finished product should be taken from the same location as the stored lot to ensure that they received the same processing and handling as the lot they represent in some cases this will not be practical especially in large canneries if not finished samples may be taken at the end of the processing line at proper intervals if needed consult your supervisor for guidance for a quality assurance or qap type contract only finished product is used for verifying reliability there are many important reasons for examining the finished product the lot is subject to further handling and processing after line checks are examined character in many products may be adversely affected by rough handling or overcooking canned foods may be overcooked or undercooked frozen foods may not be completely frozen the color of the product may deteriorate because of improper processing or may be improved by heat exchange and equalization oxidation and pinking will sometimes be prominent in certain products after processing even though not apparent in the raw product bruises in the raw product often diminish or disappear after heat processing frozen fruits may develop considerable oxidation between the line check and freezing operation adulteration by foreign material is possible if various fruit products are held too long in warm weather after sugaring and packaging higher mold counts may be found in samples after freezing than were found in line sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of check samples objectionable material may be introduced where packing medium is added at a point after line checks are taken improper cooling may cause external rust on canned foods soon after processing cooker jams or rough handling may dent many cans in the lot under certain conditions cans may panel or buckle after improper cooling after freezing and the resulting expansion frozen foods in packing media may show poor condition because of leakers liquid may soak through and discolor primary containers of some frozen foods if held too long in the containers before freezing dried foods may be excessively moist in containers with faulty seals it may be necessary to disregard line check indications and base the final grade of the product entirely on examination of finished product samples in this situation the line check score sheets should include an explanation about why they were considered unreliable c incomplete grade a final grade cannot be determined without finished product inspection if inspection results are only available from unprocessed line checks an incomplete grade ig may be established by supplementing line check results with any other factors affecting quality of which the inspector is aware experience with the product is the key to determining accurate incomplete grades products bearing approved identification must be completely inspected and assigned a final grade issue only incomplete grades on lots that have been shipped before finished product samples can be drawn unless official inspection can be completed at the point where the lots arrive never issue a final grade based on a few cases left from a lot that has been shipped unless the certificate covers only those few cases remaining if part of a lot is shipped before samples can be drawn assign an incomplete grade to the shipped portion and a final grade to the remaining portion noting complete details on the score sheets and daily inspection reports involved if sufficient finished product sample units are later examined from a lot previously assigned an incomplete grade and if they indicate lot quality to be higher or lower than the incomplete grade the final grade is based on the examination of finished product samples

been sorted out of the regular pack this is particularly true with rtp cherries strawberries and other berries although we do not wish to encourage this type of inspection we also have no grounds for refusing to inspect a product according to u s standards quite often the question is whether the grade should be substandard or whether the product is gnc or there may be a buyer specification and we need to determine if the product meets that specification for these situations use the following guidelines a be sure to check the product for foreign material as indicated in the aim inspection series foreign material manual b even if the product meets the buyer s specification it should also be on hold for re examination account foreign material where examination for filth indicates the product might exceed the guidelines then proceed in accordance with aim inspection series foreign material manual c if the product is frozen in bulk such as barrels certification and inspection should

restrict foreign material examination to one factor such as mold count leaving other applicable filth analyses undetermined reporting results a reporting inspection results it s crucial to report result to the plant in a timely manner to the processor this is one of the main advantages of having in plant inspection plant employees designated to receive reports must be identified for new inspectors an individual line check sample that is below desired quality should be reported immediately to the designated plant contact so he or she may take any necessary corrective action this person is usually a qa or qc manager or technician it s a good policy to note on the line check sheet both the name of the plant contact and the time the notification was given after verbal reporting written notification is usually provided to the plant in three ways notification to the designated plant contact person immediately after results are obtained the inspector should establish a daily routine for sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of reporting grading results to the person responsible for placing lots into storage for example writing the grade of each item packed on the warehouse manager s copy of the pack report or plant production report copies of the score sheets if desired copies of the daily inspection report b reporting special cases products that are grade not certified or fail fda standards or fail requirements pertaining to the use of approved identification on the label marks all require special reporting procedures the plant will want to prevent recurrence and to make sure these items are not inadvertently shipped or mixed with like items in the warehouse a letter should be written to the responsible plant official according to division regulations the designated plant individual responsible for hold disposition should sign the letter and enter the date received four copies of the letter should be

equipment when sampling and sanitation requirements dictate follow the plant s procedures for lock out tag out procedures and do not place your hands or any body part within the confines of operating equipment at all times safety first b inspection of products processed elsewhere there may be times when plant management purchases a processed fruit or vegetable for resale or further processing the inspector should honor an occasional request by the plant to inspect and or certify such a product provided that the product was not officially inspected before there should be no additional charge for this service unless the inspector s workday is lengthened in the process however if the plant inspector is not proficient in grading the product or if the plant facilities lack necessary inspection equipment plant management should be advised to request that the product be inspected under lot inspection on a fee basis through the area oic c in plant tanker inspection and sealing a good sanitation and sealing program is crucial to maintaining the quality level and integrity of the product the processor shipper is responsible for the sanitary conditions of tankers product loading off loading and sealing sci responsibilities are limited to grading and related inspection activities this includes monitoring tanker sanitation assigning product grade assisting in proper sealing and documentation of inspection results sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of plant s role a notify inspector if tanker sealing is requested and if any sealing requirements are specified b provide adequate lighting and the tools necessary to provide tanker inspection c provide a sanitary loading facility and a clean tanker capable of being properly sealed d make valves accessible for inspection properly load the tanker insure proper sealing and provide acceptable seals usda seals may be used in lieu of company seals e determine acceptable packer s risk in respect to loading tanker based on tankers back haul record f ensure that occupational safety and health administration osha requirements are addressed sci s role a monitor and conduct sanitation checks of equipment and tankers for proper sanitation b document and report unacceptable sanitation conditions to management c notify management of tankers that cannot be properly sealed tanker condition and loading sites although not required it is recommended that the loading area be sheltered from the weather in unsheltered locations the load may be contaminated by objects falling into the product or insects and foreign objects intruding into uncovered loading nozzles product shall not be loaded unless the tanker has been inspected the loading equipment must be clean verification of these conditions is a responsibility jointly shared by both processor and inspector sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of prior to loading the designated plant person should obtain a wash ticket from the transport company prior to acceptance for loading these are usually attached to the rear port the ticket may be examined to confirm acceptable previous back hauls adequate washing and trailer identification if the tanker is to be sealed it should be determined that it can be properly sealed during the pre loading sanitation check properly sealed means that the openings are sealed to prevent access to the product sealing requires tight seals and secure fittings and should meet customer specifications tanker inspection a safety precautions usda personnel should never enter the tanker entry into a closed tanker requires a confined space permit see the regulations cfr found at the following internet address http www gpo gov fdsys browse collectioncfr action collectioncode cfr this is required by the occupational safety and health administration osha and is the responsibility of the industry to provide when a tanker is presented for inspection usda personnel shall allow plant personnel to break seals and open lids before performing inspections at no time will usda personnel enter a tanker b inspection of tanker parts use a flashlight to inspect the tanker visually inspect lids valves fittings vent covers gaskets and openings look inside the tank both to the front and to the rear through the dome lid examine for any product residue indicating an unclean surface loose equipment and helmets should be secured or removed before approaching any openings c wash water when residual wash or rinse water is present it should be drained from the tanker it may be checked for metal shavings detergent residue and traces of product tankers are not expected to be completely dry and may contain some amount of clean water in the absence of residual water the dry surface of the rear valve may be checked for residues a magnet may be used on the residue if the presence of metal shavings is suspected sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when unacceptable conditions exist such as metal shavings detergent and or residues product and or residues and or mold residues the tanker must be rejected until properly cleaned if it is determined that the tanker is not clean any product loaded would be grade not certified d ability to seal in controlled situations it may not be necessary to remove all seals otherwise remove the seals and open rear side or under tank assemblies dust cover plunger and cap to product lines top dome lids and vent caps all access areas should be inspected for the ability to seal when the tanker cannot be properly sealed notify the applicant note when the applicant has requested tanker sealing and the tanker cannot be properly sealed but the processor elects to ship without seals the appropriate inspection documents will show tanker cannot be properly sealed incoming tankers with product acceptable verification and product receiving procedures should be established between in plant inspectors and plant personnel verification should include trailer identity and a review of inspection documents with seal numbers when applicable note acceptance or rejection of product is at the receiver s discretion sci inspectors will consider the product as officially graded if the usda documents accompanying the load are consistent with the load identity regardless of whether or not applied seals are intact sealing loaded tankers when sealing is requested and proper sealing is completed seal numbers shall be recorded on the score sheet and other appropriate inspection documents all previous seals shall be replaced with new seals except under controlled situations when tankers are being used for continuous loading and off loading for example if the tanker remains within acceptable conditions while operating back and forth between inspection sites only the seals necessary for on and off loading need to be changed this decision is a joint responsibility between the shipper and the trucking company the inspector will monitor verification of seals that remain intact throughout the operation sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a dome area the top dome should be sealed with at least two seals placed on opposite sides of the hatch lid if the hinge can be removed additional seals may be necessary b lower areas after the processor has properly secured valves and closed the covers the access door will be sealed on tankers that have all valves inside a locked box after the processor has closed the valve and installed the dust cover and retainer nut the dust cover will be sealed on tankers with rear or lower valves with dust covers c vents to be considered properly sealed all vents must be equipped so that seals may be installed other areas of concern a temperature product temperatures can be verified during the loading process as specified by standards or other applicable specifications results will be recorded on appropriate inspection documents b score sheets the score sheet and certificate confirm that the product in the tanker is the product that has been inspected d syrup designations syrup designation is based on brix readings determined on equalized product that is after the equalization of the natural sugars in the fruit and sugars in the in going packing medium for the inspection purposes of canned fruits in syrup equalization is considered complete days after packing however rather than delay inspection for the day time needed for this process equalization may be achieved by comminuting all of the product and all of the packing medium together this is known as simulated equalization see the brix section in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual for additional information on simulated equalization procedures sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of simulated equalization compliance of each item with a specified syrup designation shall be determined on a shift basis on samples drawn at regular intervals entire individual containers must be blended for each determination a sampling sample units may be drawn from the processing line at any point after the seaming operation and preferably where they emerge from the cooking and cooling operation samples for simulated equalization may be obtained as follows the same container that is used for grade determination may be used for brix determination if all fruit and syrup can be retrieved for comminuting after quality factors have been determined loss of either fruit or syrup component will lead to inaccurate results separate containers may be drawn from the line for brix determination only b sampling frequency the sampling frequency for brix determination is based on the required number of sample units needed to meet the on line sampling rate in the regulations and knowledge of previous production at least three determinations must be made refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual for information regarding time sampling plans that cover non quality factors sampling frequency shall be as follows low volume one sample unit per to minutes medium volume one sample unit per minutes high volume one sample unit per minutes no change in sampling frequency is necessary unless production for three consecutive basic production periods production shift indicates a change from one volume designation to another c sub group samples if the plant wants more than one determination each time for example sub groups of two the number of sub groups shall be equal to or exceed one third of the number of sample units required sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of by the regulations on line sampling plan do not average the two readings each container must meet the acceptance criteria as shown in acceptance criteria on the following page d lateral samples lateral samples may be drawn at the option of the plant however these samples may be used only for the plant s guidance or to confirm rejection of a lot they may not be used to determine compliance with the average specified as shown under acceptance criteria e sampling failed lots if a lot fails because of low average brix or insufficient sample units less than minimum number required the lot may be rejected however the packer has the option to request that additional containers be drawn throughout the lot to make up to at least the minimum required for on line in plant inspection if the inspector elects to draw more than this minimum it shall be in increments as outlined in the regulations i e f general procedure record the net weights when line samples are in the laboratory this information may be valuable to the processor since to some extent low or high net weights influence the final brix readings cool the samples to approximately degrees f before opening if they are available use several blender bowls to save time in comminuting multiple samples designate each bowl for use on those products that are consistently close in degrees brix after one sample unit is comminuted it may be poured back into its original container the bowl should be completely drained before another sample unit is comminuted continue this procedure until all containers are blended and the comminuted product s is ready for refractometer readings leave the bowls inverted after brix measurements have been completed or wash with hot water and thoroughly dry before each use g communication when a brix determination is below the required value immediately notify the proper designated plant official record the name of this plant employee and the time of notification on work sheet or score sheet sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of if requested check additional blends and record these additional values in a separate column on blend sheet or work sheet these would be considered lateral samples and cannot be used to erase results of official samples day equalization to bring a lot up to date fifteen days or more after pack measure the brix on all sample units using techniques described in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual incorporate these readings with the original blend readings if they confirm the original results if these readings fail to confirm the original results make a full inspection for brix at the appropriate single sampling rate and certify on this basis disregarding the readings obtained by simulated equalization acceptance criteria a code or group of codes may be considered separately from other codes in a shift if it meets the full single sampling rate to be considered acceptable the re sampled portion must meet the requirements listed below portions that fail to meet these requirements are rejected a simulated equalization the average brix of the sample must be within the range of the specified syrup designation except as indicated in paragraph a no individual sample unit may be below the range of the next lower or above the next higher syrup designation if no lower designation exists none may fall more than degrees brix below the minimum of the specified syrup designation not more than three successive brix readings on sample units drawn at regular intervals may be below the minimum or above the maximum for the specified designation if an individual container fails paragraph a draw three additional containers representing the production of approximately the same time period record results on blend or work sheet adjacent to the low sample unit use these additional three test results to appraise the status of the sub group period as follows sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a if or more of the additional three brix readings are below the minimum or above the maximum requirement for the intended syrup designation reject the period code b if no more than one of these additional three brix readings is below the minimum or above the maximum the period is accepted or failed based on evaluation of the entire shift b day equalization the average brix must be within the range of the specified syrup designation no individual may be below the range of the next lower or above the next higher syrup designation if no lower designation exists none may fall more than degrees brix below the minimum of the specified syrup designation in plant inspectors filing system a list of key management and plant personnel names should be kept on file for ready access by new inspection personnel since title and structure of management levels differ between plants the lists may vary accordingly the form and style should be based on plant management structure and chain of command include names of plant contact individuals on each shift since many inspectors go from plant to plant it is important that the filing systems be relatively uniform to minimize confusion for inspectors this system consists of two basic parts a yearly file and a permanent file in many plants these files may be adequately housed in a single file drawer larger plants requiring a greater number of records may need a three drawer filing cabinet whatever type of storage is used it must be lockable the iic is allowed flexibility in establishing these files the inspector only needs to set up folders for those topics applying to the particular plant and

usda grade or inspection marks when reviewing product manufacturer labels the inspector must check for all issues that are required under the inspection agreement with industry contract if a state or federal statute requires certain label information and requires that product meet certain criteria for their special mark the inspector s review should include these criteria any deviations should be reported to plant management inspectors should not enter into any discussion or controversy over label statements that are under mandatory labeling regulations such as under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or applicable state laws and regulations however inspectors should be aware of any incidences of potentially deceptive or inaccurate labeling if you are directly aware of such an incident through knowledge of the plant s processes report it to your supervisor if processors distributors or others in private industry have questions about proper labeling they should be tactfully referred to the agency usually fda with authority on the subject for further label information see the labeling section of this manual although the national office approves the use of official label marks by the applicant the iic of a plant will be responsible for reviewing and verifying all labeling materials bearing approved identification questions or problems that cannot be resolved are to be directed through the normal chain of command when labels are completed and available at the plant they should be reviewed as far in advance of use as possible the ideal situation would be to review preliminary label sketches paste ups or proofs of proposed labels before they are manufactured this step could prevent significant errors and save the firm considerable expense and inconvenience whether materials are checked prior to manufacture or not inspectors should be sure to verify finished labels because there may have been changes since the initial review products packed or certified under contract in plant or lot inspection may bear certain types of approved identification these products must meet the requirements stated in the regulations and additional qualifications set forth within in plant

variety of ways a blocking out with an ink stamp frozen containers may be treated in this manner by wiping the spot with a dry rag and immediately stamping with a quick drying ink such as that used for felt tipped marking pens b blocking out with paper stickers c labeling over the offending label or overwrapping over the offending overwrap the label underneath must not show through d completely stripping the labels e replacing friction type lids or screw closure lids f in many instances of mislabeling it is possible to correct the label so that it complies with regulations and therefore eliminates the need for removal of approved identification the processor should be encouraged to do so whenever possible examples of these corrections are blocking out the word inaccurately describing a syrup density and ink stamping the correct word adjacent to the block blocking out the inaccurate net weight and inserting the correct net weight blocking out the word inaccurately describing style and inserting the correct word sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of give the processor written release acknowledge the removal or label correction and

and began operations march with the converting of an existing warehouse to a ripening and cold storage unit the fresh asparagus could be held in an atmosphere of highly moisturized air and at a temperature of less than degrees f this optimum condition prevented the rapid deterioration of the product and enabled the cannery to better utilize and maintain the quality and productive capacity of their plant the month of april produced ideal growing temperatures but operations were curtailed in the month of may due to unsatisfactory growing conditions imposed by cool and windy weather despite this development the operations progressed satisfactorily with the use of the molding room for the accumulation of the fresh product a sharp cent per pound increase was noted in this year s field price over last year with no apparent rise in the important midwest and atlantic coast producing areas contrary to earlier expectations all producing areas of the united states developed packs of canned asparagus this year that exceeded the year output elberta peaches because of large increase bearing acreage and better sizing early season reports showed an estimated total crop greater than any previous year but due to an abnormally heavy green crop the elberta tonnage picked out well below these pre season estimates however overall quality was substantially superior to last year s and with significant changes in the processing facilities the pack reflects a much higher proportion of better grades this same trend is indicated generally from other canneries and as a result the marketing of this year s pack is not expected to be as severely impacted by off grade merchandise as last year s the market for elbertas continues to be unsatisfactory however due largely to continued efforts to move the heavy carry overs of the year pack kadota figs the canning operations on kadota figs commenced on october but were curtailed by difficulties in attending the harvest in the latter stages of the season lower than normal temperatures and cool nights together with water shortages have resulted in a sharp overall drop off in production this in turn caused abnormally small sizes and below average quality as a result the final production fell below pre season expectations one problem encountered in the first weeks of processing was the heavy infestation of the raw product by dried fruit beetles this contamination was caused by poor field and harvesting methods by the farmer as a result of this condition the inspector found it necessary to suggest stringent changes in preliminary washing procedures management cooperated fully and after these improvements were made there were no further problems with the finished product sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of iv products processed cont tomatoes varying conditions in various producing areas of the state resulted in a rather confused picture for early production prospects it was evident that many of the older producing areas had experienced substantial reductions in acreage due largely to the unavailability or high rental of suitable land on the other hand major acreage expansion was reported in the westfield valley where new land was being put into production the cannery started production on the first of september but as the season progressed deliveries were not sufficient to permit continuous operations one of the features of the tomato operation was the gallon drum filling installation this facility fills each of the four drums with approximately pounds of percent solid tomato paste every minutes v sanitation general appearance and housekeeping the past year was exceptionally good the usual problems of running around the clock on certain products were encountered but generally speaking the sanitation and clean up was good the plant improved the sanitation condition of the plant because of three factors the first one was the message passed down the chain of command concerning the crucial role of good plant sanitation as well as the management of a plant sanitation program an effective program was implemented and plant employees did their parts to make it work the second factor was the installation and use of a multi drop high pressure low volume kobe pumping system throughout the processing area this helped keep hand cleaning down to a minimum and also reduced the cleaning time necessary for each area the third factor was the two shift approximately nine hour schedule that was maintained during the fruit processing season this allowed a clean up crew ample time to properly clean the plant vi major changes of facilities and equipment general installation of new boiler installation of three rotary type

the can some monitoring of the legibility of the code was necessary with adjustments made when needed the plant was made aware of the inkjet type system of coding to increase legibility this could be a more accurate method to help track inventory more precisely handling and warehousing of the finished product was efficient even though the company added warehouses two years ago anticipation of a bumper crop and inventory called for the use of outside storage of their product their storage and code tracking methods allow separate tracking of all five individual production lines sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of viii application of u s standards and inspector s instructions asparagus and figs no particular problem in applying the standards and instructions peaches the standards are difficult to apply with respect to grade d and below standards in quality specifically application of the off suture cut tolerance and uniformity of size rule are not uniform and do not reflect as poor a quality as indicated instructions should provide for standard sample sizes and uniform procedures tomatoes no problem with the standards except that no provisions are made for stemmed instructions should increase the tolerance on sprouted seeds on page no standards for chopped tomatoes with basil copy of buyer s specifications for the product attached approximately cases packed ix miscellaneous with the introduction of the can dispensing units this year the overall coding system for the cannery was improved by using a basic type die mark and different combinations of side marks the cook room could better utilize the full capacity of their cookers it also proved to be more efficient in the warehouse as a mere glance at the uncased merchandise could determine its particular style grade etc x housing for inspectors the plant is located approximately miles from the city limits where there are several hotels and restaurants available at moderate rates the most affordable accommodations are at a motel located a half mile from the plant the motel has been recently renovated and complies with the federal fire and safety act this proximity to the plant also saves mileage costs this availability makes the current per diem rate for this area adequate sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date

on labels using official marks will be brought to the processor s attention as will questionable labels observed in the course of inspection depending upon the nature of the deviation corrective action may be recommended or required various additives are sometimes used in the preparation of non standardized processed foods these additives such as acids salt sugar approved colorings calcium lactate etc are usually used during the manufacturing process for example some frozen vegetables may pass through brine separators during processing and accumulate trace amounts of salt in the finished product similarly citric acid may be used in the manufacture of canned apple sauce other examples include additives such as sugar coloring and calcium lactate sometimes used during the processing of french fried potatoes the use of these substances can pose a labeling problem because of the method of application the additive s may carry over to the finished product in negligible quantities this may seem to be inconsequential however since many of these products are not standardized under food and drug labeling requirements it is necessary to declare each ingredient including additives when used it is the responsibility of the packer to conform to fda requirements sci approval of labels with official marks does not relieve the company of this responsibility we will not

completion the purpose of this instruction is to provide guidelines for completing score sheets and tally sheets it is extremely important for score sheets and tally sheets to be complete accurate and legible often a score sheet is the primary means by which sci inspection results are communicated copies of score sheets and tally sheets are often requested by applicants and other financially interested parties and are frequently requested through the freedom of information act sci score sheets and tally sheets are official documents and may be introduced and accepted as evidence in litigation score sheets and tally sheets must be prepared so that the information shown is clear complete and accurate entries on score sheets and tally sheets must be based on facts observed and test results to preserve authenticity only officially approved versions of fruit and vegetable fv forms are to be used approved fv score sheets and tally sheets may not be manipulated manually or electronically do not alter original format or data approved versions of fv score sheets and tally sheets may be found in the ams forms catalog at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx each grader participating in the grading of a product is responsible for assuring that score tally sheets have all the necessary data entered correctly including accurate computations and assuring that all tests have been completed each grader will print and sign his her name on the score sheet s or tally sheet s the utmost care and diligence must be observed in the preparation of these official documents in the case of legal action inspectors may be subpoenaed by the court to testify to the accuracy of the score sheet tally sheet or resulting inspection certificate on which their signatures appear everyone from those who collect the data during inspection to those who are responsible for reviewing the work shares the responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of these documents a completing standardized score sheets and tally sheets sci policy is to record in the appropriate blocks on the score sheet or tally sheet the results of quantitative examinations analytical tests and actual quality level s observed during the grading of the product in variable grade point standards score sheets are used to assess product the overall quality factors are assigned a number and the final grade is determined in attribute standards a tally sheet is used to assess product prerequisite quality factors are examined quality factors are counted and the final grade is determined note when information that is common to both types of documents is described in this instruction the documents will be referred to as score tally sheets a thoroughly completed score tally sheet is one that has all the data required to support the grade of the product report each value in the appropriate sample unit sci division inspection series general procedures

may contact their immediate supervisor for assistance as needed note do not use the universal score sheet form fv when a product has a current standardized score tally sheet only use this form for products that do not have an applicable grade standard or for which a standardized score tally sheet is not currently available after selecting the appropriate score tally sheet enter the pre grading information this information is located on the application for inspection and certificate of sampling form fv or from in plant sources under in plant inspection the pre grading information may include but is not limited to complete name and address of applicant contract or purchase order number case count size and kind of container pertinent label information and type style or variety sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of it is helpful to the grader and anyone reviewing the score tally sheet to note the target values concerning quantitative examinations and or analytical tests for such parameters as net weight vacuum drained weight brix etc example net weight ounces min principal label marks record only essential label information on the score tally sheet essential label information includes brand name commodity name including type style count size syrup designation quality statement if any all references to net weight or drained weight or net contents country of origin and packers and or distributor s name and address additional printed data may be added to score tally sheets as long as the original score tally sheet data and format has not been altered it may be helpful to prepare a sort of template score tally sheet with added information for frequent applicants labels or other information verify this with your supervisor before preparing photocopying and using these templates with their pre printed information can be a time saver however if the score tally sheet has pre printed information added this information must be verified before continuing you must check to make sure that none of the information has changed since the score tally sheet template was prepared label information should be recorded exactly as found on the label if a container has extensive label markings and it is not possible to attach a label label markings may be shown on the reverse of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in the label section of the score tally sheet stating that label marks are listed on the reverse side it is permissible to write in the label section of the score tally sheet the brand name as shown on the label followed by the statement see attached label and attach a label in lieu of copying the label information onto the score tally sheet see the following example sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of example no size and kind of container ounce beaded body enamel lined metal cans label valley brand grape juice see attached label container mark or identification primary case sample codes when grading lot inspection samples containing numerous mixed codes it is helpful to sort and arrange the sample units logically alphabetically numerically and or chronologically this ensures that like codes are grouped together and codes are easier to track when transferred to the score tally sheet record code markings in the row titled container mark or identification within this row there are two separate rows identified as primary and case see the example above the u s standards for condition of food containers defines the primary container as the immediate container in which the product is packaged and which serves to protect preserve and maintain the condition of the product it may be metal glass fiber wood textile plastic paper or any other suitable type of material and may be supplemented by liners overwraps or other protective materials the case would then be considered the container in which the primary container is packaged in the case of bulk packed products the case may be the primary container as for example processed raisins in pound cases the case code marks for such products would be recorded in the area designated for primary codes there would be no entry for case codes accurately record the code markings on the score tally sheet code markings are to be recorded exactly as they are written on the container refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual and certification manual for examples of how to record code marks and allowable exceptions all marks and spaces have a significant meaning in the code and should be accurately recorded on the score tally sheet if a code includes a time designation or marking it must be recorded if the color of the ink used is part of the code marks record the color of the ink when repeating identical code marks use arrows to show sample units in the lot that have the identical primary or case code markings this is the only area on the score tally sheet that arrows may be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when codes contain excessive numbers letters or symbols and are too long to be legibly written within the space provided on the score tally sheet the codes may be shown on the reverse side codes will be identified by sample number and listed left to right just as they would appear on the front of the score tally sheet in the row entitled container mark or identification if there is only one code in the lot that exceeds the space provided on the score tally sheet the code may be written in the remarks section whenever a code mark is written anywhere other than in the container mark or identification section of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in that section indicating where the code s is listed example container mark or identification primary code marks on reverse side of score sheet case corrections when an entry on a score tally sheet requires correction the only approved method is to draw a single line through the error write the correct entry next to the error and initial the correction white out is not allowed if the date of the correction is different from the date of the score tally sheet show the date of the correction example recording data follow the directions as shown in aim inspection series technical procedures manual which references procedures for recording weights vacuum readings and headspace when recording analytical data on the score tally sheet use the correct units of measure for example if a u s grade standard states that drained weight is recorded in ounces then record the data onto the score tally sheet in ounces rather than pounds or grams color tb sci division inspection

in whole numbers only score point averages are rounded to the nearest whole number record as record as for specified defects record only to the point of significant accuracy as determined by the method and equipment used for the analysis see the aim inspection series certification manual for additional information on recording analytical data unless otherwise specified net contents net weights drained weights brix readings and other similar factors shall be recorded to the first decimal place example net weight ounces min for analytical determinations in which the value is

to identify or flag any score points causing a limiting rule to affect the sample grade the following list of optional limiting rule symbols may be used to identify score point results that cause a limiting rule to affect the sample unit grade grade b quality factor a circle around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned grade b even though the total score point value indicates grade a grade c quality factor a triangle around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned grade c even though the total score point value indicates a higher grade substandard quality factor a square around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned substandard even though the total score point value indicates a higher grade note when any abbreviations or symbols are used to flag information on the score tally sheet a key

products are re inspected in order to issue either an up to date certificate or an appeal certificate frequently the applicant doesn t question the quality and condition of the lot but needs a current certificate in order to satisfy a buyer seller contract occasionally the quality of previously inspected merchandise is questioned by a financially interested party and they request an appeal inspection inspection certificates are accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts contained within although it is division policy to assign only one grade representing a specific lot as a whole there have been cases involving the perishable agricultural commodities act paca in which both the plaintiff and defendant produced usda certificates each with a different grade it is very difficult to settle such claims unless the grade on one certificate can be reversed there should be no conflicting certificates on the lot unless the quality of the lot has changed due to age storage handling or other condition factors if such a change has taken place the original certificate is valid for the date of original inspection and the later certificate is also valid for the date of the later inspection these instructions will address such situations a formal appeal inspections if possible formal appeal inspections should be discouraged an appeal may often be avoided by having the inspector or supervisor review a few samples of the product with the applicant he or she can explain why the sample units were assigned a certain grade or why certain factors were evaluated as they were if the applicant requests a formal appeal the inspection should be handled as outlined in the regulations for appeal inspections these instructions supplement the regulations filing for appeal an appeal inspection may be requested by any financially interested party who is not satisfied with the results of the inspection as represented by a certificate on the lot in question they may file for an appeal provided a the lot of processed products can be identified as the same lot previously inspected b the request is within days of the previous inspection this period may be extended by the

certificate is reversed and copies of the appeal certificate are sent to all financially interested parties denying request for appeal requests for an appeal inspection may be denied under the following circumstances a the complaint concerns a factor which may have undergone a change of condition since the original inspection such as oxidation of frozen fruits severe de tinning of apple sauce or other canned product hydrogen swells or other types of spoilage frozen broccoli or asparagus spears that are shattered due to possible mishandling flavor deterioration of canned citrus juice due to long storage at high temperatures and severe dehydration of frozen vegetables b the lot cannot be identified c the first inspection certification was based on restricted sampling for an example of a certificate showing restricted sampling see the aim inspection series certification manual d code marks do not agree with the original inspection e count does not agree with the original certificate there are certain exceptions to this provision if the original certificate covered a large lot and the re inspection covers a substantial quantity of merchandise an appeal on a portion of the original certificate may be granted provided that there is no question about identity however an appeal would not be granted on a very small segment of the original quantity for example if the quantity would be substantially less than the quantity represented by a single sample unit on the original inspection f lot is not accessible for proper sampling g if there has been a revision to the grade standards between the two sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of inspections and such revision would affect the grade assigned to the product h the original certificate is grade not certified gnc account unsanitary conditions of the plant or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material for example a frog or mouse may be found in a container during the original inspection plant conditions may warrant a gnc certificate even though this incident is strictly accidental it would be most unlikely that a re inspection of the lot would find another frog or mouse however the division would not deem it advisable to completely ignore previous production or inspection history and reverse the original inspection certificate i reasons for appeal are inadequate or frivolous for example i just don t trust the inspectors in the location office j when it is not in the interest of usda to perform the appeal this is a broad category and the national office would need to evaluate all facts in order to render an appropriate decision even if denied an appeal inspection due to any of these reasons the applicant may request a re inspection or an up to date inspection on the lot in question the result of this new inspection would establish the grade of the lot except that no grade would be assigned if usda records show that the original certificate was gnc account unsanitary processing conditions or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material see h above performing the appeal a information required the application may be made orally or in writing

next sample size larger than the normal sampling rate for the lot size based on the single sampling plan in other words if the sample size in the regulations would normally be for the size of lot involved at least sample units would be drawn on the same lot for an appeal inspection if the applicant merely requests an up to date inspection and it is not known until the sample is examined that an appeal is in order as determined by the division the certificate should not be issued until additional sample units are drawn since stratification can occur in large containers at least a portion of samples of bulk container lots such as pound frozen should be full containers for example frozen strawberries may contain rocks that would tend to settle to the bottom of the can during handling prior to freezing a subsample from the top or center of the can is not likely to reveal the presence of this type of foreign material c who may perform the appeal inspection any inspector other than the inspector who performed the original inspection may perform an appeal inspection whenever practical two inspectors who are thoroughly familiar with the product should be assigned to conduct the appeal if one inspector starts the inspection and the need to issue an appeal inspection certificate doesn t become evident until the inspection is partially complete a second inspector should be called in to confirm the results d notify the regional and national offices if a formal appeal is filed or if during a routine re inspection procedure it appears that an appeal is in order notify the regional and national offices they may require a few samples to verify the new inspection results e examination of product because of the economic significance of the appeal all samples of the product

packers use large bulk containers called tote bins for frozen vegetables these bins are used during the packing season to store frozen vegetables for repack at a later date the bins vary in size and construction but can hold as much as a ton of product for financial reasons users of tote bins need to know whether or not the product is free flowing or frozen in a solid mass the type of pack should always be shown in the body of the inspection certificate a free flowing describes a pack in which the individual units of the pack are not frozen together in a solid mass but may be easily separated into individual units there may be some crusting on the interior surface of the tote bin or a few clumps of units frozen together within the container but these can be separated with moderate pressure b solid mass describes a pack in which the individual units of the product in the container are predominantly or entirely frozen together in a solid mass such product will require additional cost in repacking the product due a special break up step in the process for the purpose of inspection and certification a lot can be a group of tote bins or a single tote bin tote bins must be properly

procedures the order of examination for quality analytical and microanalyses is much the same for most products generally factors that are affected by exposure to the air are evaluated first such as color for some products such as jams jellies and applesauce consistency is the first consideration another general rule is to make the physical and organoleptic examination before analytical and micro tests cooking or any other tests that do not require the product to be intact or that would not be affected by the results of other testing familiarity with the product its grade standard and any additional grading instructions is essential in starting grading procedures the color factor is more critical in some products such as mushrooms and sweet potatoes but in all cases there is a tendency for product to become dull and somewhat darkened on exposure to air color should be evaluated soon as possible after the container is opened after obtaining net weights be alert for any abnormal product or container characteristics upon opening containers a in the case of dried fruits look for darkening sugaring etc b for jams and jellies check for mold in the head space area in low moisture fruits and fruit juice crystals or powder look for caking c for frozen product look for abnormal appearance color and or odor observe amount of frost ice crystals layer of ice dehydration shattered or broken units as in broccoli and asparagus d for canned product look for darkening in the head space area particularly with light colored products such as applesauce e also visually check the head space of canned fruits and vegetables often the actual measurement is unnecessary since the can is obviously filled to more than percent of its capacity as a general rule check the headspace of any sample units that have a low net weight or appear to have a low content level this is done easily with a head space gauge f after emptying cans to determine fill of container and or drained weight check metal cans for internal defects such as severe detinning or rust sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining net contents a definitions gross weight is the weight of the packaged unit including both the food and the primary container tare or tare weight is the weight of the empty clean dry primary container in which the food is packaged net weight is the difference between the gross weight and the tare weight it is the weight of the food itself including any packing medium b scales scale accuracy and sensitivity to one tenth of an ounce is adequate for most grading purposes in some instances greater sensitivity may be necessary for example it may be necessary to weigh small packages in gram units rather than ounces individual procedures for specific products will incorporate such requirements check scales frequently to verify that they are accurate and in proper working order a standardized weight or set of calibrated weights may be used for this purpose these weights must be kept clean and damage free and not used for routine weighing operations c rules for reading scales tares electronic scales can zero tare weights exactly if using a mechanical scale read to the higher mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and the weight of the tare can is between and ounces read the weight as ounces when the tare has been established the tare bar may be adjusted accordingly and the net weights can be read directly if there is no predetermined tare take gross weights first and determine the tare weight after containers are empty clean and dry record net weight by subtracting the tare weight from the gross weight gross net and drained weight read to the lower mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and if a package of asparagus weights between and ounces read as ounces d taking net weights place containers on the scale in the center of the pan for an accurate reading if there is any residue on the containers such as frost on the exterior surfaces of frozen food packages remove such material before weighing sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of e measuring net contents when the product is fluid in nature use the following methods to determine net contents or volume convert net weight to fluid ounces after determining net weights as indicated above convert to volume measurement with the following formula net weight oz x fill fl oz specific gravity degrees c example tomato juice no cylinder net weight ounces refractive index degrees c see aim inspection series technical procedures manual sucrose conversion table to obtain specific gravity specific gravity fill fl oz measuring flask glass flasks are available that are accurately calibrated for measuring volume of liquids the flask is calibrated for volume of a liquid at a standard temperature usually degrees c the legend is etched on each flask the fluid product being measured must be at this temperature for accuracy it is also important to avoid incorporating air into the liquid when filling the flask to do so always pour the liquid slowly down the side of the flask heavier products such as tomato juice nectars etc must stand after filling the flask to permit any trapped air to escape determining tare weight these procedures applies to all types of primary containers cans glass fiber etc except polyethylene or other thin plastic film when the weight of the primary container is quite uniform and is a very small percentage of the total gross weight in such uniform light weight poly bags a single bag from the lot may be used as the tare when the tare involves cartons the liquid from frozen products such as frozen sliced strawberries soaks into the fiber during the freezing period rather than using new or air dried cartons use soaked cartons wiped with a dry towel to determine the tare for such a lot sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a field office procedures option average tare wash dry and weigh empty containers from the lot subtract the smallest weight from

greater or greater b field office procedures option two heaviest if it is impractical or impossible to weigh the number of containers called for in the above table or if the applicant desires use the average weight of the heaviest of the containers as the tare c in plant inspection option average tare select at random empty containers and lids and weigh them collectively if possible use the average weight from these containers as the tare make this tare determination at least once per day normally early in the shift and again at any time there is a change in the supply of containers d in plant inspection option pre weighed tare weigh the tare containers and mark these containers with their respective weights or identify the containers with the tare weight recorded on the worksheet pass these pre weighed tare containers through the filler and capture them after a point where there is no further chance to alter the fill subtract the appropriate tare weight from the gross weight to determine the net weight of each container e in plant inspection option heaviest tare in some instances the plant may wish to use the heaviest of the weighed cans as tare or if in line control is based on subgroups of for example cans the heaviest of the may be used as the tare this option should only be used when the plant requests such restrictive control sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining drained weight tare a dry empty mesh sieve except use a mesh sieve for canned tomatoes use the inch diameter sieve for smaller capacity containers and the inch diameter sieve for larger containers rest one edge of the tared sieve on the side of a grading tray approximately inches deep this will produce a sieve slope angle of about to degrees distribute the product evenly on the screen except for canned spinach which is not spread on the screen drain for two minutes without disturbing the product except to invert halves of fruit that are obviously holding pockets of syrup at the end of two minutes place the sieve on the scale and read the drained weight directly to expedite grading and examination of the product it is ideal to have several sieves standardized to a particular weight this can be done through careful selection of sieves and the addition of solder or stainless steel washers and wire to increase the lighter sieves to the weight of the heaviest by using a single tare on the scale standardized sieve weights will allow multiple drained weight samples to be weighed sequentially at the end of the two minute draining period do not re tare the sieves after the first weighing any slight residue remaining on the mesh is considered a part of drained weight re taring the sieve would offset this small increment of weight however the sieve should be washed if there is excessive build up of material and syrup this is often seen when draining canned apples for example grade or compliance determination when inspection for quality is based on any u s grade standard with a scoring system there is an allowance for samples that fall below the quality of the indicated grade lot sizes range from sample

point where the physical characteristics and quality will not be altered by any further hand or mechanical means but may be subject to further processing such as final freezing line checks for grade determination are considered official samples they provide a record of what has happened during the packing shift they keep the inspector and the processor informed of conditions during processing and helps the processor keep quality at the desired level the number of line check samples examined will depend on the sampling plan in effect at a particular processing plant see the aim inspection series sampling manual for on line sampling procedures use approved score sheets and tally sheets for recording inspection results the ams forms catalog which may be found at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx contains a list of approved score sheets and tally sheets see the score sheet and tally sheet section of this manual for guidelines on the development approval and completion of plant specific score sheets whenever possible make samples available for examination by plant officials and supervisors after grading this affords the inspector an opportunity to discuss any pertinent observations or changes needed during production and encourages communication between all parties the plant supervisors and subordinate inspectors a line checks for grade determination of finished product samples of the finished product are taken after processing is complete and no further change in quality is likely to occur samples are selected on a random basis so that each sample unit has an equal chance of being selected if the production rate is reasonably uniform spaced sampling intervals during a set period of packing time will generally produce good lot representation if the rate of production fluctuates considerably the sampling interval should be adjusted accordingly regardless of production patterns inspectors must not be too predictable in their sampling intervals such predictability may allow for processor manipulation timed to temporarily improve the product at the anticipated sample selection time this may be more of a problem if the grading site is located far away from the processing lines and in view of the production workers line check personnel would be seen while on their way to draw samples in time for workers to intensify their efforts to improve quality the inspector s goal is to draw samples that accurately reflect the quality of the product and such samples are not representative of the lot samples of finished product should receive all the same processing and handling as the lot which they represent and should ideally be taken from the location of the stored lot if this is not practical due to the size of the facility or location of storage consult your supervisor for guidance sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b line checks of unprocessed product line checks of samples prior to final processing give the inspector and the processor an immediate picture of the likely finished product quality the processor can promptly implement correction procedures if needed to improve subsequent production these line checks are generally considered official samples that are used to help determine the final grade of the product since they are not processed all unprocessed line check sample units from the canning line must be opened immediately after the sample units are drawn samples drawn at this stage are limited in the extent to which they fully reflect finished product inspectors must examine samples of the finished product before assigning a final grade regardless of the number of line check samples evaluated samples of the finished product should be taken from the same location as the stored lot to ensure that they received the same processing and handling as the lot they represent in some cases this will not be practical especially in large canneries if not finished samples may be taken at the end of the processing line at proper intervals if needed consult your supervisor for guidance for a quality assurance or qap type contract only finished product is used for verifying reliability there are many important reasons for examining the finished product the lot is subject to further handling and processing after line checks are examined character in many products may be adversely affected by rough handling or overcooking canned foods may be overcooked or undercooked frozen foods may not be completely frozen the color of the product may deteriorate because of improper processing or may be improved by heat exchange and equalization oxidation and pinking will sometimes be prominent in certain products after processing even though not apparent in the raw product bruises in the raw product often diminish or disappear after heat processing frozen fruits may develop considerable oxidation between the line check and freezing operation adulteration by foreign material is possible if various fruit products are held too long in warm weather after sugaring and packaging higher mold counts may be found in samples after freezing than were found in line sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of check samples objectionable material may be introduced where packing medium is added at a point after line checks are taken improper cooling may cause external rust on canned foods soon after processing cooker jams or rough handling may dent many cans in the lot under certain conditions cans may panel or buckle after improper cooling after freezing and the resulting expansion frozen foods in packing media may show poor condition because of leakers liquid may soak through and discolor primary containers of some frozen foods if held too long in the containers before freezing dried foods may be excessively moist in containers with faulty seals it may be necessary to disregard line check indications and base the final grade of the product entirely on examination of finished product samples in this situation the line check score sheets should include an explanation about why they were considered unreliable c incomplete grade a final grade cannot be determined without finished product inspection if inspection results are only available from unprocessed line checks an incomplete grade ig may be established by supplementing line check results with any other factors affecting quality of which the inspector is aware experience with the product is the key to determining accurate incomplete grades products bearing approved identification must be completely inspected and assigned a final grade issue only incomplete grades on lots that have been shipped before finished product samples can be drawn unless official inspection can be completed at the point where the lots arrive never issue a final grade based on a few cases left from a lot that has been shipped unless the certificate covers only those few cases remaining if part of a lot is shipped before samples can be drawn assign an incomplete grade to the shipped portion and a final grade to the remaining portion noting complete details on the score sheets and daily inspection reports involved if sufficient finished product sample units are later examined from a lot previously assigned an incomplete grade and if they indicate lot quality to be higher or lower than the incomplete grade the final grade is based on the examination of finished product samples

been sorted out of the regular pack this is particularly true with rtp cherries strawberries and other berries although we do not wish to encourage this type of inspection we also have no grounds for refusing to inspect a product according to u s standards quite often the question is whether the grade should be substandard or whether the product is gnc or there may be a buyer specification and we need to determine if the product meets that specification for these situations use the following guidelines a be sure to check the product for foreign material as indicated in the aim inspection series foreign material manual b even if the product meets the buyer s specification it should also be on hold for re examination account foreign material where examination for filth indicates the product might exceed the guidelines then proceed in accordance with aim inspection series foreign material manual c if the product is frozen in bulk such as barrels certification and inspection should be restricted to that portion of the containers from which the sample is drawn d do not show mold counts or rot counts or actual numerical results of any filth examination on the certificate e do not restrict foreign material examination to one factor such as mold count leaving other applicable filth analyses undetermined reporting results a reporting inspection results it s crucial to report result to the plant in a timely manner to the processor this is one of the main advantages of having in plant inspection plant employees designated to receive reports must be identified for new inspectors an individual line check sample that is below desired quality should be reported immediately to the designated plant contact so he or she may take any necessary corrective action this person is usually a qa or qc manager or technician it s a good policy to note on the line check sheet both the name of the plant contact and the time the notification was given after verbal reporting written notification is usually provided to the plant in three ways notification to the designated plant contact person immediately after results are obtained the inspector should establish a daily routine for sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of reporting grading results to the person responsible for placing lots into storage for example writing the grade of each item packed on the warehouse manager s copy of the pack report or plant production report copies of the score sheets if desired copies of the daily inspection report b reporting special cases products that are grade not certified or fail fda standards or fail requirements pertaining to the use of approved identification on the label marks all require special reporting procedures the plant will want to prevent recurrence and to make sure these items are not inadvertently shipped or mixed with like items in the warehouse a letter should be written to the responsible

natural sugars in the fruit and sugars in the in going packing medium for the inspection purposes of canned fruits in syrup equalization is considered complete days after packing however rather than delay inspection for the day time needed for this process equalization may be achieved by comminuting all of the product and all of the packing medium together this is known as simulated equalization see the brix section in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual for additional information on simulated equalization procedures sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of simulated equalization compliance of each item with a specified syrup designation shall be determined on a shift basis on samples drawn at regular intervals entire individual containers must be blended for each determination a sampling sample units may be drawn from the processing line at any point after the seaming operation and preferably where they emerge from the cooking and cooling operation samples for simulated equalization may be obtained as follows the same container that is used for grade determination may be used for brix determination if all fruit and syrup can be retrieved for comminuting after quality factors have been determined loss of either fruit or syrup component will lead to inaccurate results separate containers may be drawn from the line for brix determination only b sampling frequency the sampling frequency for brix determination is based on the required number of sample units needed to meet the on line sampling rate in

cover non quality factors sampling frequency shall be as follows low volume one sample unit per to minutes medium volume one sample unit per minutes high volume one sample unit per minutes no change in sampling frequency is necessary unless production for three consecutive basic production periods production shift indicates a change from one volume designation to another c sub group samples if

shown in acceptance criteria on the following page d lateral samples lateral samples may be drawn at the option of the plant however these samples may be used only for the plant s guidance or to confirm rejection of a lot they may not be used to determine compliance with the average specified as shown under acceptance criteria e sampling failed lots if a lot fails because of low average brix or insufficient sample units less than minimum number required the lot may be rejected however the packer has the option to request that additional containers be drawn throughout the lot to make up to at least the minimum required for on line in plant inspection if the inspector elects to draw more than this minimum it shall be in increments as outlined in the regulations i e f general procedure record the net weights when line samples are in the laboratory this information may be valuable to the processor since to some extent low or high net weights influence the final brix readings cool the samples to approximately degrees f before opening if they are available use several blender bowls to save time in comminuting multiple samples designate each bowl for use on those products that are consistently close in degrees brix after one sample unit is comminuted it may be poured back into its original container the bowl should be completely drained before another sample unit is comminuted continue this procedure until all containers are blended and the comminuted product s is ready for refractometer readings leave the bowls inverted after brix measurements have been completed or wash with hot water and thoroughly dry before each use g communication when a brix determination is below the required value immediately notify the proper designated plant official record the name of this plant employee and the time of notification on work sheet or score sheet sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of if requested check additional blends and record these additional values in a separate column on blend sheet or work sheet these would be considered lateral samples and cannot be used to erase results of official samples day equalization to bring a lot up to date fifteen days or more after pack measure the brix on all sample units using techniques described in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual incorporate these readings with the original blend readings if they confirm the original results if these readings fail to confirm the original results make a full inspection for brix at the appropriate single sampling rate and certify on this basis disregarding the readings obtained by simulated equalization acceptance criteria a code or group of codes may be considered separately from other codes in a shift if it meets the full single sampling rate to be considered acceptable the re sampled portion must meet the requirements listed below portions that fail to meet these requirements are rejected a simulated equalization the average brix of the sample must be within the range of the specified syrup designation except as indicated in paragraph a no individual sample unit may be below the range of the next lower or above the next higher syrup designation if no lower designation exists none may fall more than degrees brix below the minimum of the specified syrup designation not more than three successive brix readings on sample units drawn at regular intervals may be below the minimum or above the maximum for the specified designation if an individual container fails paragraph a draw three additional containers representing the production of approximately the same time period record results on blend or work sheet adjacent to the low sample unit use these additional three test results to appraise the status of the sub group period as follows sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a if or more of the additional three brix readings are below the

below the range of the next lower or above the next higher syrup designation if no lower designation exists none may fall more than degrees brix below the minimum of the specified syrup designation in plant inspectors filing system a list of key management and plant personnel names should be kept on file for ready access by new inspection personnel since title and structure of management levels differ between plants the lists may vary accordingly the form and style should be based on plant management structure and chain of command include names of plant contact individuals on each shift since many inspectors go from plant to plant it is important that the filing systems be relatively uniform to minimize confusion for inspectors this system consists of two basic parts a yearly file and a permanent file in many plants these files may be adequately housed in a single file drawer larger plants requiring a greater number of records may need a three drawer filing cabinet whatever type of storage is used it must be lockable the iic is allowed flexibility in establishing these files the inspector only needs to set up folders for those topics applying to the particular plant and

usda grade or inspection marks when reviewing product manufacturer labels the inspector must check for all issues that are required under the inspection agreement with industry contract if a state or federal statute requires certain label information and requires that product meet certain criteria for their special mark the inspector s review should include these criteria any deviations should be reported to plant management inspectors should not enter into any discussion or controversy over label statements that are under mandatory labeling regulations such as under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or applicable state laws and regulations however inspectors should be aware of any incidences of potentially deceptive or inaccurate labeling if you are directly aware of such an incident through knowledge of the plant s processes report it to your supervisor if processors distributors or others in private industry have questions about proper labeling they should be tactfully referred to the agency usually fda with authority on the subject for further label information see the labeling section of this manual although the national office approves the use of official label marks by the applicant the iic of a plant will be responsible for reviewing and verifying all labeling materials bearing approved identification questions or problems that cannot be resolved are to be directed through the normal chain of command when labels are completed and available at the plant they should be reviewed as far in advance of use as possible the ideal situation would be to review preliminary label sketches paste ups or proofs of proposed labels before they are manufactured this step could prevent significant errors and save the firm considerable expense and inconvenience whether materials are checked prior to manufacture or not inspectors should be sure to verify finished labels because there may have been changes since the initial review products packed or certified under contract in

and began operations march with the converting of an existing warehouse to a ripening and cold storage unit the fresh asparagus could be held in an atmosphere of highly moisturized air and at a temperature of less than degrees f this optimum condition prevented the rapid deterioration of the product and enabled the cannery to better utilize and maintain the quality and productive capacity of their plant the month of april produced ideal growing temperatures but operations were curtailed in the month of may due to unsatisfactory growing conditions imposed by cool and windy weather despite this development the operations progressed satisfactorily with the use of the molding room for the accumulation of the fresh product a sharp cent per pound increase was noted in this year s field price over last year with no apparent rise in the important midwest and atlantic coast producing areas contrary to earlier expectations all producing areas of the united states developed packs of canned asparagus this year that exceeded the year output elberta peaches because of large increase bearing acreage and better sizing early season reports showed an estimated total crop greater than any previous year but due to an abnormally heavy green crop the elberta tonnage picked out well below these pre season estimates however overall quality was substantially superior to last year s and with significant changes in the processing facilities the pack reflects a much higher proportion of better grades this same trend is indicated generally from other canneries and as a result the marketing of this year s pack is not expected to be as severely impacted by off grade merchandise as last year s the market for elbertas continues to be unsatisfactory however due largely to continued efforts to move the heavy carry overs of the year pack kadota figs the canning operations on kadota figs commenced on october but were curtailed by difficulties in attending the harvest in the latter stages of the season lower than normal temperatures and cool nights together with water shortages have resulted in a sharp overall drop off in production this in turn caused abnormally small sizes and below average quality as a result the final production fell below pre season expectations one problem encountered in the first weeks of processing was the heavy infestation of the raw product by dried fruit beetles this contamination was caused by poor field and harvesting methods by the farmer as a result of this condition the inspector found it necessary to suggest stringent changes in preliminary washing procedures management cooperated fully and after these improvements were made there were no further problems with the finished product sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of iv products processed cont tomatoes varying conditions in various producing areas of the state resulted in a rather confused picture for early production prospects it was evident that many of the older producing areas had experienced substantial reductions in acreage due largely to the unavailability or high rental of suitable land on the other hand major acreage expansion was reported in the westfield valley where new land was being put into production the cannery started production on the first of september but as the season progressed deliveries were not sufficient to permit continuous operations one of the features of the tomato operation was the gallon drum filling installation this facility fills each of the four drums with approximately pounds of percent solid tomato paste every minutes v sanitation general appearance and housekeeping the past year was exceptionally good the usual problems of running around the clock on certain products were encountered but generally speaking the sanitation and clean up was good the plant improved the sanitation condition of the plant because of three factors the first one was the message passed down the chain of command concerning the crucial role of good plant sanitation as well as the management of a plant sanitation program an effective program was implemented and plant employees did their parts to make it work the second factor was the installation and use of a multi drop high pressure low volume kobe pumping system throughout the processing area this helped keep hand cleaning down to a minimum and also reduced the cleaning time necessary for each area the third factor was the two shift approximately nine hour schedule that was maintained during the fruit processing season this allowed a clean up crew ample time to properly clean the plant vi major changes of facilities and equipment general installation of new boiler installation of three rotary type

the can some monitoring of the legibility of the code was necessary with adjustments made when needed the plant was made aware of the inkjet type system of coding to increase legibility this could be a more accurate method to help track inventory more precisely handling and warehousing of the finished product was efficient even though the company added warehouses two years ago anticipation of a bumper crop and inventory called for the use of outside storage of their product their storage and code tracking methods allow separate tracking of all five individual production lines sci division

product attached approximately cases packed ix miscellaneous with the introduction of the can dispensing units this year the overall coding system for the cannery was improved by using a basic type die mark and different combinations of side marks the cook room could better utilize the full capacity of their cookers it also proved to be more efficient in the warehouse as a mere glance at the uncased merchandise could determine its particular style grade etc x housing for inspectors the plant is located approximately miles from the city limits where there are several hotels and restaurants available at moderate rates the most affordable accommodations are at a motel located a half mile from the plant the motel has been recently renovated and complies with the federal fire and safety act

on labels using official marks will be brought to the processor s attention as will questionable labels observed in the course of inspection depending upon the nature of the deviation corrective action may be recommended or required various additives are sometimes used in the preparation of non standardized processed foods these additives such as acids salt sugar approved colorings calcium lactate etc are usually used during the manufacturing process for example some frozen vegetables may pass through brine separators during processing and accumulate trace amounts of salt in the finished product similarly citric acid may be used in the manufacture of canned apple sauce other examples include additives such as sugar coloring and calcium lactate sometimes used during the processing of french fried potatoes the use of these substances can pose a labeling problem because of the method of application the additive s may carry over to the finished product in negligible quantities this may seem to be inconsequential however since many of these products are not standardized under food and drug labeling requirements it is necessary to declare each ingredient including additives when used it is the responsibility of the packer to conform to fda requirements sci approval of labels with official marks does not relieve the company of this responsibility we will not

completion the purpose of this instruction is to provide guidelines for completing score sheets and tally sheets it is extremely important for score sheets and tally sheets to be complete accurate and legible often a score sheet is the primary means by which sci inspection results are communicated copies of score sheets and tally sheets are often requested by applicants and other financially interested parties and are frequently requested through the freedom of information act sci score sheets and tally sheets are official documents and may be introduced and accepted as evidence in litigation score sheets and tally sheets must be prepared so that the information shown is clear complete and accurate entries on score sheets and tally sheets must be based on facts observed and test results to preserve authenticity only officially approved versions of fruit and vegetable fv forms are to be used approved fv score sheets and tally sheets may not be manipulated manually or electronically do not alter original format or data approved versions of fv score sheets and tally sheets may be found in the ams forms catalog at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx each grader participating in the grading of a product is responsible for assuring that score tally sheets have all the necessary data entered correctly including accurate computations and assuring that all tests have been completed each grader will print and sign his her name on the score sheet s or tally sheet s the utmost care and diligence must be observed in the preparation of these official documents in the case of legal action inspectors may be subpoenaed by the court to testify to the accuracy of the score sheet tally sheet or resulting inspection certificate on which their signatures appear everyone from those who collect the data during inspection to those who are responsible for reviewing the work shares the responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of these documents a completing standardized score sheets and tally sheets sci policy is to record in the appropriate blocks on the score sheet or tally sheet the results of quantitative examinations analytical tests and actual quality level s observed during the grading of the product in variable grade point standards score sheets are used to assess product the overall quality factors are assigned a number and the final grade is determined in attribute standards a tally sheet is used to assess product prerequisite quality factors are examined quality factors are counted and the final grade is determined note when information that is common to both types of documents is described in this instruction the documents will be referred to as score tally sheets a thoroughly completed score tally sheet is one that has all the data required to support the grade of the product report each value in the appropriate sample unit sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of box do not use symbols such as ditto marks check marks or arrows to repeat a value except arrows may be used to show repeating codes example container mark or identification primary case do not leave empty boxes on the score tally sheet unless the row is marked n a a long dash such as will be used to indicate no data when a test was not performed on a sample unit it is not necessary to put dashes in boxes that are marked type style etc when it is clear that no values are required to be entered for each sample unit example style sliced count to reduce the likelihood of being altered draw diagonal lines through remaining empty columns rows on the score tally sheet after the final sample unit example sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of date score tally sheets with the date the grading is performed if more than one date is required to complete the grading more than one date must appear on the score tally sheet example official usda inspector print and sign name john doe john doe date note all entries on the score tally sheet must be in permanent blue ink record factual information do not include any personal opinions or assumptions on the score tally sheet score tally sheets must be complete accurate and legible the first step in completing a score tally sheet is locating the most up to date version available these forms are located in printable pdf format in the ams forms catalog the ams forms catalog is available at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx click on the view box on the right of the screen for a drop down list then click on fruit and vegetable and scroll to the fv form number needed inspectors without intranet access may contact their immediate supervisor for assistance as needed note do not use the universal score sheet form fv when a product has a current standardized score tally sheet only use this form for products that do not have an applicable grade standard or for which a standardized score tally sheet is not currently available after selecting the appropriate score tally sheet enter the pre grading information this information is located on the application for inspection and certificate of sampling form fv or from in plant sources under in plant inspection the pre grading information may include but is not limited to complete name and address of applicant contract or purchase order number case count size and kind of container pertinent label information and type style or variety sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of it is helpful to the grader and anyone reviewing the score tally sheet to note the target values concerning quantitative examinations and or analytical tests for such parameters as net weight vacuum drained weight brix etc example net weight ounces min principal label marks record only essential label information on the score tally sheet essential label information includes brand name commodity name including type style count size syrup designation quality statement if any all references to net weight or drained weight or net contents country of origin and packers and or distributor s name and address additional printed data may be added to score tally sheets as long as the original score tally sheet data and format has not been altered it may be helpful to prepare a sort of template score tally sheet with added information for frequent applicants labels or other information verify this with your supervisor before preparing photocopying and using these templates with their pre printed information can be a time saver however if the score tally sheet has pre printed information added this information must be verified before continuing you must check to make sure that none of the information has changed since the score tally sheet template was prepared label information should be recorded exactly as found on the label if a container has extensive label markings and it is not possible to attach a label label markings may be shown on the reverse of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in the label section of the score tally sheet stating that label marks are listed on the reverse side it is permissible to write in the label section of the score tally sheet the brand name as shown on the label followed by the statement see attached label and attach a label in lieu of copying the label information onto the score tally sheet see the following example sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of example no size and kind of container ounce beaded body enamel lined metal cans label valley brand grape juice see attached label container mark or identification primary case sample codes when grading lot inspection samples containing numerous mixed codes it is helpful to sort and arrange the sample units logically alphabetically numerically and or chronologically this ensures that like codes are grouped together and codes are easier to track when transferred to the score tally sheet record code markings in the row titled container mark or identification within this row there are two separate rows identified as primary and case see the example above the u s standards for condition of food containers defines the primary container as the immediate container in which the product is packaged and which serves to protect preserve and maintain the condition of the product it may be metal glass fiber wood textile plastic paper or any other suitable type of material and may be supplemented by liners overwraps or other protective materials the case would then be considered the container in which the primary container is packaged in the case of bulk packed products the case may be the primary container as for example processed raisins in pound cases the case code marks for such products would be recorded in the area designated for primary codes there would be no entry for case codes accurately record the code markings on the score tally sheet code markings are to be recorded exactly as they are written on the container refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual and certification manual for examples of how to record code marks and allowable exceptions all marks and spaces have a significant meaning in the code and should be accurately recorded on the score tally sheet if a code includes a time designation or marking it must be recorded if the color of the ink used is part of the code marks record the color of the ink when repeating identical code marks use arrows to show sample units in the lot that have the identical primary or case code markings this is the only area on the score tally sheet that arrows may be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when codes contain excessive numbers letters or symbols and are too long to be legibly written within the space provided on the score tally sheet the codes may be shown on the reverse side codes will be identified by sample number and listed left to right just as they would appear on the front of the score tally sheet in the row entitled container mark or identification if there is only one code in the lot that exceeds the space provided on the score tally sheet the code may be written in the remarks section whenever a code mark is written anywhere other than in the container mark or identification section of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in that section indicating where the code s is listed example container mark or identification primary code marks on reverse side of score sheet case corrections when an entry on a score tally sheet requires correction the only approved method is to draw a single line through the error write the correct entry next to the error and initial the correction white out is not allowed if the date of the correction is different from the date of the score tally sheet show the date of the correction example recording data follow the directions as shown in aim inspection series technical procedures manual which references procedures for recording weights vacuum readings and headspace when recording analytical data on the score tally sheet use the correct units of measure for example if a u s grade standard states that drained weight is recorded in ounces then record the data onto the score tally sheet in ounces rather than pounds or grams color tb sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when rounding numbers it is important to observe the significance of the numbers being recorded score points on a score sheet are recorded in whole numbers only score point averages are rounded to the nearest whole number record as record as for specified defects record only to the point of significant accuracy as determined by the method and equipment used for the analysis see the aim inspection series certification manual for additional information on recording analytical data unless otherwise specified net contents net weights drained weights brix readings and other similar factors shall be recorded to the first decimal place example net weight ounces min for analytical determinations in which the value is relatively low usually less than percent record to the second decimal place example total acidity as malic g ml recoverable oil is recorded to the third decimal place example recoverable oil percent

commercial item description cid or other specification shall be flagged to bring attention to the nonconformance sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of example net weight ounces min vacuum inches min quality factors subject to limiting rules are shown as part of the score sheet for the product as an option during grading the inspector may use symbols to identify or flag any score points causing a limiting rule to affect the sample grade the following list of optional limiting rule symbols may be used to identify score point results that cause a limiting rule to affect the sample unit grade grade b quality factor a circle around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned grade b even though the total score point value indicates grade a grade c quality factor a triangle around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned grade c even though the total score point value indicates a higher grade substandard quality factor a square around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned substandard even though the total score point value indicates a higher grade note when any abbreviations or symbols are used to flag information on the score tally sheet a key

the following guidance is intended to assist policy writers to develop policy documents and should be read in conjunction with the policy document template summary table all the important information relating to the policy should be displayed at the top of the policy document so that it is easily accessible for the reader this information should include the policy title date of approval effective date date for review name of the policy officer policy title where possible the first word of the title should refer to the substance of the policy this will assist the reader access the policy from the policy a z e g accreditation of prior learning policy rather than policy on the accreditation of prior learning structure information should be presented in a logical sequence to assist the reader policy writers should use the section structure provided within the template but may create sub headings if necessary context may contain some contextual or background information and may include a sentence on how the policy supports the university s strategic plan definitions if necessary include an explanation of terms or abbreviations used within the policy and procedure where there are existing definitions of the terms in other university regulations or policy those definitions should be used purpose a concise statement on why the policy exists and what is its intent this statement should not contain background information or detailed explanations and should be suitable to act as a summary for viewing on the policy a z prior to the user reviewing the whole document scope specify the parameters of the policy which university cohort does the policy apply to this section should also reference any exclusions from the operation of the policy policy principles principles should provide broad directional information and the rationale for the policy by embodying the university s expected outcomes of its application roles and responsibilities some policies may require the articulation of roles to be undertaken by those responsible for applying the policy outline the university s expectations and detail the responsibilities of relevant parties process optional detailed operational procedures are separate from policy documents however some procedural information may be appropriately provided in the policy document particularly with regard to academic decision making policy toolkit guidelines for completion of policy documents document management policy documents and appendices are structured and presented consistently using the policy document template document control during the development stage there may be a number of people contributing to the development of a draft policy and so document version control is very important it is the responsibility of the policy officer to keep track of the developing drafts of the document via a continuously updated master document version numbers should be used to signify each revised version of the draft and a record of summarised revisions should be kept by the policy officer document version history all policy documents should include a comprehensive revision list at the end of the document this should chart the formal approval route and note any changes proposed by university committees this version history should remain on the published policy document and be updated following any subsequent changes to the policy style when drafting policy documents it is useful to bear in mind that different audiences are likely to access the policy and that policy users are not necessarily subject matter experts and may be accessing information on a topic for the first time it is important that policy documents are written in a clear and concise manner using plain english and avoiding jargon to ensure consistency of style and presentation those drafting policy documents are asked to consider the following use the policy document template use plain english and simple short sentences main headings and paragraphs should be numbered sequentially to facilitate referencing policy should be directive in style and therefore words such as will and must are appropriate to create a recognisable identity for policy documents a uniform format should be used font arial headings in bold and paragraphs separated by one line space policies should be as succinct as possible

products are re inspected in order to issue either an up to date certificate or an appeal certificate frequently the applicant doesn t question the quality and condition of the lot but needs a current certificate in order to satisfy a buyer seller contract occasionally the quality of previously inspected merchandise is questioned by a financially interested party and they request an appeal inspection inspection certificates are accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts contained within although it is division policy to assign only one grade representing a specific lot as a whole there have been cases involving the perishable agricultural commodities act paca in which both the plaintiff and defendant produced usda certificates each with a different grade it is very difficult to settle such claims unless the grade on one certificate can be reversed there should be no conflicting certificates on the lot unless the quality of the lot has changed due to age storage handling or other condition factors if such a change has taken place the original certificate is valid for the date of original inspection and the later certificate is also valid for the date of the later inspection these instructions will address such situations a formal appeal inspections if possible formal appeal inspections should be discouraged an appeal may often be avoided by having the inspector or supervisor review a few samples of the product with the applicant he or she can explain why the sample units were assigned a certain grade or why certain factors were evaluated as they were if the applicant requests a formal appeal the inspection should be handled as outlined in the regulations for appeal inspections these instructions supplement the regulations filing for appeal an appeal inspection may be requested by any financially interested party who is not satisfied with the results of the inspection as represented by a certificate on the lot in question they may file for an appeal provided a the lot of processed products can be identified as the same lot previously inspected b the request is within days of the previous inspection this period may be extended by the regional or national offices and c the complaint concerns a factor s which would not be a result of a change in a condition factor s since the previous inspection see section below sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the division will issue an appeal certificate when it has been established that the previous inspection is in error the original certificate is reversed and copies of the appeal certificate are sent to all financially interested parties denying request for appeal requests for an appeal inspection may be denied under the following circumstances a the complaint concerns a factor which may have undergone a change of condition since the original inspection such as oxidation of frozen fruits severe de tinning of apple sauce or other canned product hydrogen swells or other types of spoilage frozen broccoli or asparagus spears that are shattered due to possible mishandling flavor deterioration of canned citrus juice due to long storage at high temperatures and severe dehydration of frozen vegetables b the lot cannot be identified c the first inspection certification was based on restricted sampling for an example of a certificate showing restricted sampling see the aim inspection series certification manual d code marks do not agree with the original inspection e count does not agree with the original certificate there are certain exceptions to this provision if the original certificate covered a large lot and the re inspection covers a substantial quantity of merchandise an appeal on a portion of the original certificate may be granted provided that there is no question about identity however an appeal would not be granted on a very small segment of the original quantity for example if the quantity would be substantially less than the quantity represented by a single sample unit on the original inspection f lot is not accessible for proper sampling g if there has been a revision to the grade standards between the two sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of inspections and such revision would affect the grade assigned to the product h the original certificate is grade not certified gnc account unsanitary conditions of the plant or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material for example a frog or mouse may be found in a container during the original inspection plant conditions may warrant a gnc certificate even though this incident is strictly accidental it would be most unlikely that a re inspection of the lot would find another frog or mouse however the division would not deem it advisable to completely ignore previous production or inspection history and reverse the original inspection certificate i reasons for appeal are inadequate or frivolous for example i just don t trust the inspectors in the location office j when it is not in the interest of usda to perform the appeal this is a broad category and the national office would need to evaluate all facts in order to render an appropriate decision even if denied an appeal inspection due to any of these reasons the applicant may request a re inspection or an up to date inspection on the lot in question the result of this new inspection would establish the grade of the lot except that no grade would be assigned if usda records show that the original certificate was gnc account unsanitary processing conditions or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material see h above performing the appeal a information required the application may be made orally or in writing if made orally it must be confirmed in writing it must include the location of the lot the reason s for the appeal the date and serial number of the certificate covering the original inspection of the product and the name of issuing office sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b sampling the sampling rate on an appeal inspection should be at least the next sample size larger than the normal sampling rate for the lot size based on the single sampling plan in other words if the sample size in the regulations would normally be for the size of lot involved at least sample units would be drawn on the same lot for an appeal inspection if the applicant merely requests an up to date inspection and it is not known until the sample is examined that an appeal is in order as determined by the division the certificate should not be issued until additional sample units are drawn since stratification can occur in large containers at least a portion of samples of bulk container lots such as pound frozen should be full containers for example frozen strawberries may contain rocks that would tend to settle to the bottom of the can during handling prior to freezing a subsample from the top or center of the can is not likely to reveal the presence of this type of foreign material c who may perform the appeal inspection any inspector other than the inspector who performed the original inspection may perform an appeal inspection whenever practical two inspectors who are thoroughly familiar with the product should be assigned to conduct the appeal if one inspector starts the inspection and the need to issue an appeal inspection certificate doesn t become evident until the inspection is partially complete a second inspector should be called in to confirm the results d notify the regional and national offices if a formal appeal is filed or if during a routine re inspection procedure it appears that an appeal is in order notify the regional and national offices they may require a few samples to verify the new inspection results e examination of product because of the economic significance of the appeal all samples of the product should be very carefully graded and checked for all factors if objective tests are available they should be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of f gnc ordinarily an appeal would not be granted because of unsanitary plant or product conditions where the original inspection findings make an appeal unjustified see h on page fees a appeal fees are as follows grade sustained charge regular fee plus expenses grade reversed no charge for inspection but charge applicant for expenses incurred in sampling or shipping samples note an appeal certificate reversing the original inspection can only be issued after receiving authority from the national office if the inspection results indicate that this is the case submit details to the regional office the regional office will confer with the national office before results are reported or a certificate is issued certification see the aim inspection series certification manual for specific information related to the certification of appeals and re inspections sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of bulk containers frozen products packed in used containers used pound metal and or plastic containers with friction type lids are refilled by some processors of frozen foods reused containers must be clean at time of refilling obtain a letter of conformance from the processor stating that the containers were not previously used for non food products products filled into unsanitary containers are to be classed as grade not certified gnc it may be difficult to accurately describe reused containers some of these may have been used several times and appear to be old abused or otherwise damaged they may bear an assortment of code marks and label statements certification statements regarding used containers may be found in the aim inspection series certification manual note reused containers are not acceptable for government purchases state federal and department of defense unless specified in the contract or solicitation do not certify without a written waiver unless specified in the contract tote bins many packers use large bulk containers called tote bins for frozen vegetables these bins are used during the packing season to store frozen vegetables for repack at a later date the bins vary in size and construction but can hold as much as a ton of product for financial reasons users of tote bins need to know whether or not the product is free flowing or frozen in a solid mass the type of pack should always be shown in the body of the inspection certificate a free flowing describes a pack in which the individual units of the pack are not frozen together in a solid mass but may be easily separated into individual units there may be some crusting on the interior surface of the tote bin or a few clumps of units frozen together within the container but these can be separated with moderate pressure b solid mass describes a pack in which the individual units of the product in the container are predominantly or entirely frozen together in a solid mass such product will require additional cost in repacking the product due a special break up step in the process for the purpose of inspection and certification a lot can be a group of tote bins or a single tote bin tote bins must be properly identified for future re inspection segregation etc codes should be at least inch in height and stamped on the tote bins or on tags placed in upper right or left hand corner of the side normally facing the fork lift driver the area for applying the codes may be painted to facilitate application and legibility sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the coding system may include the following plant when more than plant is operated by the same company quality designation date of pack day month and year product type style size etc when not readily apparent such as covered bins or numerous product styles period shift or lot number bin numbers special notation of abnormal quality variations i e grade b for color only etc different colored tape tags or marking ink for different quality levels or other special notations to determine the sampling rate for an item packed in tote bins or bulk storage the poundage is converted to institutional size pound containers using the number of pound containers the lot would represent refer to the regulations or the aim inspection series sampling manual when sampling tote bins use a sample scoop and dig into the product as far as possible in at least locations the sample drawn from each of the three locations may be considered as a sample unit for inspection and certification if each tote bin is a separate lot it may be composited as one sample unit if the lot consists of a group of tote bins sampling may be more representative with the use of a trier or thief which will penetrate deeply into each bin this implement should be constructed to permit sampling of the product from all levels in the bin if the product is a solid mass or if representative portions of the bin cannot be sampled the certificate should be flagged to indicate the extent of restricted sampling for restricted certification of tote bins see the aim inspection series certification manual sci division inspection series

procedures the order of examination for quality analytical and microanalyses is much the same for most products generally factors that are affected by exposure to the air are evaluated first such as color for some products such as jams jellies and applesauce consistency is the first consideration another general rule is to make the physical and organoleptic examination before analytical and micro tests cooking or any other tests that do not require the product to be intact or that would not be affected by the results of other testing familiarity with the product its grade standard and any additional grading instructions is essential in starting grading procedures the color factor is more critical in some products such as mushrooms and sweet potatoes but in all cases there is a tendency for product to become dull and somewhat darkened on exposure to air color should be evaluated soon as possible after the container is opened after obtaining net weights be alert for any abnormal product or container characteristics upon opening containers a in the case of dried fruits look for darkening sugaring etc b for jams and jellies check for mold in the head space area in low moisture fruits and fruit juice crystals or powder look for caking c for frozen product look for abnormal appearance color and or odor observe amount of frost ice crystals layer of ice dehydration shattered or broken units as in broccoli and asparagus d for canned product look for darkening in the head space area particularly with light colored products such as applesauce e also visually check the head space of canned fruits and vegetables often the actual measurement is unnecessary since the can is obviously filled to more than percent of its capacity as a general rule check the headspace of any sample units that have a low net weight or appear to have a low content level this is done easily with a head space gauge f after emptying cans to determine fill of container and or drained weight check metal cans for internal defects such as severe detinning or rust sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining net contents a definitions gross weight is the weight of the packaged unit including both the food and the primary container tare or tare weight is the weight of the empty clean dry primary container in which the food is packaged net weight is the difference between the gross weight and the tare weight it is the weight of the food itself including any packing medium b scales scale accuracy and sensitivity to one tenth of an ounce is adequate for most grading purposes in some instances greater sensitivity may be necessary for example it may be necessary to weigh small packages in gram units rather than ounces individual procedures for specific products will incorporate such requirements check scales frequently to verify that they are accurate and in proper working order a standardized weight or set of calibrated weights may be used for this purpose these weights must be kept clean and damage free and not used for routine weighing operations c rules for reading scales tares electronic scales can zero tare weights exactly if using a mechanical scale read to the higher mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and the weight of the tare can is between and ounces read the weight as ounces when the tare has been established the tare bar may be adjusted accordingly and the net weights can be read directly if there is no predetermined tare take gross weights first and determine the tare weight after containers are empty clean and dry record net weight by subtracting the tare weight from the gross weight gross net and drained weight read to the lower mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and if a package of asparagus weights between and ounces read as ounces d taking net weights place containers on the scale in the center of the pan for an accurate reading if there is any residue on the containers such as frost on the exterior surfaces of frozen food packages remove such material before weighing sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of e measuring net contents when the product is fluid in nature use the following methods to determine net contents or volume convert net weight to fluid ounces after determining net weights as indicated above convert to volume measurement with the following formula net weight oz x fill fl oz specific gravity degrees c example tomato juice no cylinder net weight ounces refractive index degrees c see aim inspection series technical procedures manual sucrose conversion table to obtain specific gravity specific gravity fill fl oz measuring flask glass flasks are available that are accurately calibrated for measuring volume of liquids the flask is calibrated for volume of a liquid at a standard temperature usually degrees c the legend is etched on each flask the fluid product being measured must be at this temperature for accuracy it is also important to avoid incorporating air into the liquid when filling the flask to do so always pour the liquid slowly down the side of the flask heavier products such as tomato juice nectars etc must stand after filling the flask to permit any trapped air to escape determining tare weight these procedures applies to all types of primary containers cans glass fiber etc except polyethylene or other thin plastic film when the weight of the primary container is quite uniform and is a very small percentage of the total gross weight in such uniform light weight poly bags a single bag from the lot may be used as the tare when the tare involves cartons the liquid from frozen products such as frozen sliced strawberries soaks into the fiber during the freezing period rather than using new or air dried cartons use soaked cartons wiped with a dry towel to determine the tare for such a lot sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a field office procedures option average tare wash dry and weigh empty containers from the lot subtract the smallest weight from

greater or greater b field office procedures option two heaviest if it is impractical or impossible to weigh the number of containers called for in the above table or if the applicant desires use the average weight of the heaviest of the containers as the tare c in plant inspection option average tare select at random empty containers and lids and weigh them collectively if possible use the average weight from these containers as the tare make this tare determination at least once per day normally early in the shift and again at any time there is a change in the supply of containers d in plant inspection option pre weighed tare weigh the tare containers and mark these containers with their respective weights or identify the containers with the tare weight recorded on the worksheet pass these pre weighed tare containers through the filler and capture them after a point where there is no further chance to alter the fill subtract the appropriate tare weight from the gross weight to determine the net weight of each container e in plant inspection option heaviest tare in some instances the plant may wish to use the heaviest of the weighed cans as tare or if in line control is based on subgroups of for example cans the heaviest of the may be used as the tare this option should only be used when the plant requests such restrictive control sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining drained weight tare a dry empty mesh sieve except use a mesh sieve for canned tomatoes use the inch diameter sieve for smaller capacity containers and the inch diameter sieve for larger containers rest one edge of the tared sieve on the side of a grading tray approximately inches deep this will produce a sieve slope angle of about to degrees distribute the product evenly on the screen except for canned spinach which is not spread on the screen drain for two minutes without disturbing the product except to invert halves of fruit that are obviously holding pockets of syrup at the end of two minutes place the sieve on the scale and read the drained weight directly to expedite grading and examination of the product it is ideal to have several sieves standardized to a particular weight this can be done through careful selection of sieves and the addition of solder or stainless steel washers and wire to increase the lighter sieves to the weight of the heaviest by using a single tare on the scale standardized sieve weights will allow multiple drained weight samples to be weighed sequentially at the end of the two minute draining period do not re tare the sieves after the first weighing any slight residue remaining on the mesh is considered a part of drained weight re taring the sieve would offset this small increment of weight however the sieve should be washed if there is excessive build up of material and syrup this is often seen when draining canned apples for example grade or compliance determination

sauce because the u s standards do not generally include sauces and garnishes as a part of product description misunderstandings have led to incorrect certification of such products as no applicable grade a policy division policy is to consider the u s standards for the principal item as applicable to those products packed with or in or seasoned with another ingredient consider the u s standards for both items as applicable to those products packed and another ingredient examples for frozen peas with onions the primary ingredient would be considered peas and the u s standards for frozen peas would be applicable onions would be considered a garnish sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of for canned peas and onions the product is considered a

grade peas u s grade a or u s fancy onions u s grade b or u s extra standard b inspection procedure it may be difficult to grade certain products because of the presence of a sauce seasoning or garnish in general these should be removed by washing and draining from the main product prior to grading then the principal ingredient can be evaluated in accordance with its u s standard observing the quality of various ingredients prior to mixing can be helpful under in plant inspection consideration should be given to the effect of the garnish or seasoning on the appearance and eating quality of the end item for example if lima beans are packed in butter sauce that has a rancid flavor which carries over into the end product certify the product as substandard example grade substandard account off flavor rancid flavor in butter sauce some sauces may contribute a flavor that one inspector finds distasteful such as a pungent or sharp cheese sauce this would be normal for the

point where the physical characteristics and quality will not be altered by any further hand or mechanical means but may be subject to further processing such as final freezing line checks for grade determination are considered official samples they provide a record of what has happened during the packing shift they keep the inspector and the processor informed of conditions during processing and helps the processor keep quality at the desired level the number of line check samples examined will depend on the sampling plan in effect at a particular processing plant see the aim inspection series sampling manual for on line sampling procedures use approved score sheets and tally sheets for recording inspection results the ams forms catalog which may be found at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx contains a list of approved score sheets and tally sheets see the score sheet and tally sheet section of this manual for guidelines on the development approval and completion of plant specific score sheets whenever possible make samples available for examination by plant officials and supervisors after grading this affords the inspector an opportunity to discuss any pertinent observations or changes needed during production and encourages communication between all parties the plant supervisors and subordinate inspectors a line checks for grade determination of finished product samples of the finished product are taken after processing is complete and no further change in quality is likely to occur samples are selected on a random basis so that each sample unit has an equal chance of being selected if the production rate is reasonably uniform spaced sampling intervals during a set period of packing time will generally produce good lot representation if the rate of production fluctuates considerably the sampling interval should be adjusted accordingly regardless of production patterns inspectors must not be too predictable in their sampling intervals such predictability may allow for processor manipulation timed to temporarily improve the product at the anticipated sample selection time this may be more of a problem if the grading site is located far away from the processing lines and in view of the production workers line check personnel would be seen while on their way to draw samples in time for workers to intensify their efforts to improve quality the inspector s goal is to draw samples that accurately reflect the quality of the product and such samples are not representative of the lot samples of finished product should receive all the same processing and handling as the lot which they represent and should ideally be taken from the location of the stored lot if this is not practical due to the size of the facility or location of storage consult your supervisor for guidance sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b line checks of unprocessed product line checks of samples prior to final processing give the inspector and the processor an immediate picture of the likely finished product quality the processor can promptly implement correction procedures if needed to improve subsequent production these line checks are generally considered official samples that are used to help determine the final grade of the product since they are not processed all unprocessed line check sample units from the canning line must be opened immediately after the sample units are drawn samples drawn at this stage are limited in the extent to which they fully reflect finished product inspectors must examine samples of the finished product before assigning a final grade regardless of the number of line check samples evaluated samples of the finished product should be taken from the same location as the stored lot to ensure that they received the same processing and handling as the lot they represent in some cases this will not be practical especially in large canneries if not finished samples may be taken at the end of the processing line at proper intervals if needed consult your supervisor for guidance for a quality assurance or qap type contract only finished product is used for verifying reliability there are many important reasons for examining the finished product the lot is subject to further handling and processing after line checks are examined character in many products may be adversely affected by rough handling or overcooking canned foods may be overcooked or undercooked frozen foods may not be completely frozen the color of the product may deteriorate because of improper processing or may be improved by heat exchange and equalization oxidation and pinking will sometimes be prominent in certain products after processing even though not apparent in the raw product bruises in the raw product often diminish or disappear after heat processing frozen fruits may develop considerable oxidation between the line check and freezing operation adulteration by foreign material is possible if various fruit products are held too long in warm weather after sugaring and packaging higher mold counts may be found in samples after freezing than were found in line sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of check samples objectionable material may be introduced where packing medium is added at a point after line checks are taken improper cooling may cause external rust on canned foods soon after processing cooker jams or rough handling may dent many cans in the lot under certain conditions cans may panel or buckle after improper cooling after freezing and the resulting expansion frozen foods in packing media may show poor condition because of leakers liquid may soak through and discolor primary containers of some frozen foods if held too long in the containers before freezing dried foods may be excessively moist in containers with faulty seals it may be necessary to disregard line check indications and base the final grade of the product entirely on examination of finished product samples in this situation the line check score sheets should include an explanation about why they were considered unreliable c incomplete grade a final grade cannot be determined without finished product inspection if inspection results are only available from unprocessed line checks an incomplete grade ig may be established by supplementing line check results with any other factors affecting quality of which the inspector is aware experience with the product is the key to determining accurate incomplete grades products bearing approved identification must be completely inspected and assigned a final grade issue only incomplete grades on lots that have been shipped before finished product samples can be drawn unless official inspection can be completed at the point where the lots arrive never issue a final grade based on a few cases left from a lot that has been shipped unless the certificate covers only those few cases remaining if part of a lot is shipped before samples can be drawn assign an incomplete grade to the shipped portion and a final grade to the remaining portion noting complete details on the score sheets and daily inspection reports involved if sufficient finished product sample units are later examined from a lot previously assigned an incomplete grade and if they indicate lot quality to be higher or lower than the incomplete grade the final grade is based on the examination of finished product samples

been sorted out of the regular pack this is particularly true with rtp cherries strawberries and other berries although we do not wish to encourage this type of inspection we also have no grounds for refusing to inspect a product according to u s standards quite often the question is whether the grade should be substandard or whether the product is gnc or there may be a buyer specification and we need to determine if the product meets that specification for these situations use the following guidelines a be sure to check the product for foreign material as indicated in the aim inspection series foreign material manual b even if the product meets the buyer s specification it should also be on hold for re examination account foreign material where examination for filth indicates the product might exceed the guidelines then proceed in accordance with aim inspection series foreign material manual c if the product is frozen in bulk such as barrels certification and inspection should be restricted to that portion of the containers from which the sample is drawn d do not show mold counts or rot counts or actual numerical results of any filth examination on the certificate e do not restrict foreign material examination to one factor such as mold count leaving other applicable filth analyses undetermined reporting results a reporting inspection results it s crucial to report result to the plant in a timely manner to the processor this is one of the main advantages of having in plant inspection plant employees designated to receive reports must be identified for new inspectors an individual line check sample that is below desired quality should be reported immediately to the designated plant contact so he or she may take any necessary corrective action this person is usually a qa or qc manager or technician it s a good policy to note on the line check sheet both the name of the plant contact and the time the notification was given after verbal reporting written notification is usually provided to the plant in three ways notification to the designated plant contact person immediately after results are obtained the inspector should establish a daily routine for sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of reporting grading results to the person responsible for placing lots into storage for example writing the grade of each item packed on the warehouse manager s copy of the pack report or plant production report copies of the score sheets if desired copies of the daily inspection report b reporting special cases products that are grade not certified or fail fda standards or fail requirements pertaining to the use of approved identification on the label marks all require special reporting procedures the plant will want to prevent recurrence and to make sure these items are not inadvertently shipped or mixed with like items in the warehouse a letter should be written to the responsible plant official according to division regulations the designated plant individual responsible for hold disposition should sign the letter and enter the date received four copies of the letter should be made with the plant retaining the original the inspector shall make the prescribed departmental distribution on the remainder of the copies see hold and release instructions in this manual in the case

equipment at all times safety first b inspection of products processed elsewhere there may be times when plant management purchases a processed fruit or vegetable for resale or further processing the inspector should honor an occasional request by the plant to inspect and or certify such a product provided that the product was not officially inspected before there should be no additional charge for this service unless the inspector s workday is lengthened in the process however if the plant inspector is not proficient in grading the product or if the plant facilities lack necessary

natural sugars in the fruit and sugars in the in going packing medium for the inspection purposes of canned fruits in syrup equalization is considered complete days after packing however rather than delay inspection for the day time needed for this process equalization may be achieved by comminuting all of the product and all of the packing medium together this is known as simulated equalization see the brix section in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual for additional information on simulated equalization procedures sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of simulated equalization compliance of each item with a specified syrup designation shall be determined on a shift basis on samples drawn at regular intervals entire individual containers must be blended for each determination a sampling sample units may be drawn from the processing line at any point after the seaming operation and preferably where they emerge from the cooking and cooling operation samples for simulated equalization may be obtained as follows the same container that is used for grade determination may be used for brix determination if all fruit and syrup can be retrieved for comminuting after quality factors have been determined loss of either fruit or syrup component will lead to inaccurate results separate containers may be drawn from the line for brix determination only b sampling frequency the sampling frequency for brix determination is based on the required number of sample units needed to meet the on line sampling rate in the regulations and knowledge of previous production at least three determinations must be made refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual for information regarding time sampling plans that cover non quality factors sampling frequency shall be as follows low volume one sample unit per to minutes medium volume one sample unit per minutes high volume one sample unit per minutes no change in sampling frequency is necessary unless production for three consecutive basic production periods production shift indicates a change from one volume designation to another c sub group samples if

shown in acceptance criteria on the following page d lateral samples lateral samples may be drawn at the option of the plant however these samples may be used only for the plant s guidance or to confirm rejection of a lot they may not be used to determine compliance with the average specified as shown under acceptance criteria e sampling failed lots if a lot fails because of low average brix or insufficient sample units less than minimum number required the lot may be rejected however the packer has the option to request that additional containers be drawn throughout the lot to make up to at least the minimum required for on line in plant inspection if the inspector elects to draw more than this minimum it shall be in increments as outlined in the regulations i e f general procedure record the net weights when line samples are in the laboratory this information may be valuable to the processor since to some extent low or high net weights influence the final brix readings cool the samples to approximately degrees f before opening if they are available use several blender bowls to save time in comminuting multiple samples designate each bowl for use on those products that are consistently close in degrees brix after one sample unit is comminuted it may be poured back into its original container the bowl should be completely drained before another sample unit is comminuted continue this procedure until all containers are blended and the comminuted product s is ready for refractometer readings leave the bowls inverted after brix measurements have been completed or wash with hot water and thoroughly dry before each use g communication when a brix determination is below the required value immediately notify the proper designated plant official record the name of this plant employee and the time of notification on work sheet or score sheet sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of if requested check additional blends and

bring a lot up to date fifteen days or more after pack measure the brix on all sample units using techniques described in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual incorporate these readings with the original blend readings if they confirm the original results if these readings fail to confirm the original results make a full inspection for brix at the appropriate single sampling rate and certify on this basis disregarding the readings obtained by simulated equalization acceptance criteria a code or group of codes may be considered separately from other codes in a shift if it meets the full single sampling rate to be considered acceptable the re sampled portion must meet the requirements listed below portions that fail to meet these requirements are rejected a simulated

plant inspectors filing system a list of key management and plant personnel names should be kept on file for ready access by new inspection personnel since title and structure of management levels differ between plants the lists may vary accordingly the form and style should be based on plant management structure and chain of command include names of plant contact individuals on each shift since many inspectors go from plant to plant it is important that the filing systems be relatively uniform to minimize confusion for inspectors this system consists of two basic parts a yearly file and a permanent file in many plants these files may be adequately housed in a single file drawer larger plants requiring a greater number of records may need a three drawer filing cabinet whatever type of storage is used it must be lockable the iic is allowed flexibility in establishing these files the inspector only needs to set up folders for those topics applying to the particular plant and arrange them in the given sequence the letter and number of each folder enables the inspector to return it to the current filing location easily tab the folders with the approximate terminology as

usda grade or inspection marks when reviewing product manufacturer labels the inspector must check for all issues that are required under the inspection agreement with industry contract if a state or federal statute requires certain label information and requires that product meet certain criteria for their special mark the inspector s review should include these criteria any deviations should be reported to plant management inspectors should not enter into any discussion or controversy over label statements that are under mandatory labeling regulations such as under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or applicable state laws and regulations however inspectors should be aware of any incidences of potentially deceptive or inaccurate labeling if you are directly aware of such an incident through knowledge of the plant s processes report it to your supervisor if processors distributors or others in private industry have questions about proper labeling they should be tactfully referred to the agency usually fda with authority on the subject for further label information see the labeling section of this manual although the national office approves the use of official label marks by the applicant the iic of a plant will be responsible for reviewing and verifying all labeling materials bearing approved identification questions or problems that cannot be resolved are to be directed through the normal chain of command when labels are completed and available at the plant they should be reviewed as far in advance of use as possible the ideal situation would be to review preliminary label sketches paste ups or proofs of proposed labels before they are manufactured this step could prevent significant errors and save the firm considerable expense and inconvenience whether materials are checked prior to manufacture or not inspectors should be sure to verify finished labels because there may have been changes since the initial review products packed or certified under contract in plant or lot inspection may bear certain types of approved identification these products must meet the requirements stated in the regulations and additional qualifications set forth within in plant

with significant changes in the processing facilities the pack reflects a much higher proportion of better grades this same trend is indicated generally from other canneries and as a result the marketing of this year s pack is not expected to be as severely impacted by off grade merchandise as last year s the market for elbertas continues to be unsatisfactory however due largely to continued efforts to move the heavy carry overs of the year pack kadota figs the canning operations on kadota figs commenced on october but were curtailed by difficulties in attending the harvest in the latter stages of the season lower than normal temperatures and cool nights together with water shortages have resulted in a sharp overall drop off in production this in turn caused abnormally small sizes and below average quality as a result the final production fell below pre season expectations one problem encountered in the first weeks of processing was the heavy infestation of the raw product by dried fruit beetles this contamination was caused by poor field and harvesting methods by the farmer as a result of this condition the inspector found it necessary to suggest stringent changes in preliminary washing procedures management cooperated fully and after these improvements were made there were no further problems with the finished product sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of iv products processed cont tomatoes varying conditions in various producing areas of the state resulted in a rather confused picture for early production prospects it was evident that many of the older producing areas had experienced substantial reductions in acreage due largely to the unavailability or high rental of suitable land on the other hand major acreage expansion was reported in the westfield valley where new land was being put into production the cannery started production on the first of september but as the season progressed deliveries were not sufficient to permit continuous operations one of the features of the tomato operation was the gallon drum filling installation this facility fills each of the four drums with approximately pounds of percent solid tomato paste every minutes v sanitation general appearance and housekeeping the past year was exceptionally good the usual problems of running around the clock on certain products were encountered but generally speaking the sanitation and clean up was good the plant improved the sanitation condition of the plant because of three factors the first one was the message passed down the chain of command concerning the crucial role of good plant sanitation as well as the management of a plant sanitation program an effective program was implemented and plant employees did their parts to make it work the second factor was the installation and use of a multi drop high pressure low volume kobe pumping system throughout the processing area this helped keep hand cleaning down to a minimum and also reduced the cleaning time necessary for each area the third factor was the two shift approximately nine hour schedule that was maintained during the fruit processing season this allowed a clean up crew ample time to properly clean the plant vi major changes of facilities and equipment general installation of new boiler installation of three rotary type

the can some monitoring of the legibility of the code was necessary with adjustments made when needed the plant was made aware of the inkjet type system of coding to increase legibility this could be a more accurate method to help track inventory more precisely handling and warehousing of the finished product was efficient even though the company added warehouses two years ago anticipation of a bumper crop and inventory called for the use of outside storage of their product their storage and code tracking methods allow separate tracking of all five individual production lines sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of viii application of u s standards and inspector s instructions asparagus and figs no particular problem in applying the standards and instructions peaches the standards are difficult to apply with respect to grade d and below standards in quality specifically application of the off suture cut tolerance and uniformity

except that no provisions are made for stemmed instructions should increase the tolerance on sprouted seeds on page no standards for chopped tomatoes with basil copy of buyer s specifications for the product attached approximately cases packed ix miscellaneous with the introduction of the can dispensing units this year the overall coding system for the cannery was improved by using a basic type die mark and different combinations of side marks the cook room could better utilize the full capacity of their cookers it also proved to be more efficient in the warehouse as a mere glance at the uncased merchandise could determine its particular style grade etc x housing for inspectors the plant is located approximately miles from the city limits where there are several hotels and restaurants available at moderate rates the most affordable accommodations are at a motel located a half mile from the plant the motel has been recently renovated and complies with the federal fire and safety act

on labels using official marks will be brought to the processor s attention as will questionable labels observed in the course of inspection depending upon the nature of the deviation corrective action may be recommended or required various additives are sometimes used in the preparation of non standardized processed foods these additives such as acids salt sugar approved colorings calcium lactate etc are usually used during the manufacturing process for example some frozen vegetables may pass through brine separators during processing and accumulate trace amounts of salt in the finished product similarly citric acid may be used in the manufacture of canned apple sauce other examples include additives such as sugar coloring and calcium lactate sometimes used during the processing of french fried potatoes the use of these substances can pose a labeling problem because of the method of application the additive s may carry over to the finished product in negligible quantities this may seem to be inconsequential however since many of these products are not standardized under food and drug labeling requirements it is necessary to declare each ingredient including additives when used it is the responsibility of the packer to conform to fda requirements sci approval of labels with official marks does not relieve the company of this responsibility we will not

accurate computations and assuring that all tests have been completed each grader will print and sign his her name on the score sheet s or tally sheet s the utmost care and diligence must be observed in the preparation of these official documents in the case of legal action inspectors may be subpoenaed by the court to testify to the accuracy of the score sheet tally sheet or resulting inspection certificate on which their signatures appear everyone from those who collect the data during inspection to those who are responsible for reviewing the work shares the responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of these documents a completing standardized score sheets and tally sheets sci policy is to record in the appropriate blocks on the score sheet or tally sheet the results of quantitative examinations analytical tests and actual quality level s observed during the grading of the product in variable grade point standards score sheets are used to assess product the overall quality factors are assigned a number and the final grade is determined in attribute standards a tally sheet is used to assess product prerequisite quality factors are examined quality factors are counted and the final grade is determined note when information that is common to both types of documents is described in this instruction the documents will be referred to as score tally sheets a thoroughly

weight or net contents country of origin and packers and or distributor s name and address additional printed data may be added to score tally sheets as long as the original score tally sheet data and format has not been altered it may be helpful to prepare a sort of template score tally sheet with added information for frequent applicants labels or other information verify this with your supervisor before preparing photocopying and using these templates with their pre printed information can be a time saver however if the score tally sheet has pre printed information added this information must be verified before continuing you must check to make sure that none of the information has changed since the score tally sheet template was prepared label information should be recorded exactly as found on the label if a container has extensive label markings and it is not possible to attach a label label markings may be shown on the reverse of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in the label section of the score tally sheet stating that label marks are listed on the reverse side it is permissible to write in the label section of the score tally sheet the

logically alphabetically numerically and or chronologically this ensures that like codes are grouped together and codes are easier to track when transferred to the score tally sheet record code markings in the row titled container mark or identification within this row there are two separate rows identified as primary and case see the example above the u s standards for condition of food containers defines the primary container as the immediate container in which the product is packaged and which serves to protect preserve and maintain the condition of the product it may be metal glass fiber wood textile plastic paper or any other suitable type of material and may be supplemented by liners overwraps or other protective materials the case would then be considered the container in which the primary container is packaged in the case of bulk packed products the case may be the primary container as for example processed raisins in pound cases the case code marks for such products would be recorded in the area designated for primary codes there would be no entry for case codes accurately record the code markings on the score tally sheet code markings are to be recorded exactly as they are written on the container refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual and certification manual for examples of how to record code marks and allowable exceptions all marks and spaces have a significant meaning in the code and should be accurately recorded on the score tally sheet if a code includes a time designation or marking it must be recorded if the color of the ink used is part of the code marks record the color of the ink when repeating identical code marks use arrows to show sample units in the lot that have the identical primary or case code markings this is the only area on the score tally sheet that arrows may be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when codes contain excessive numbers letters or symbols and are too long to be legibly written within the space provided on the score tally sheet the codes may be shown on the reverse side codes will be identified by sample number and listed left to right just as they would appear on the front of the score tally sheet in the row entitled container mark or identification if there is only one code in the lot that exceeds the space provided on the score tally sheet the code may be written in the remarks section whenever a code mark is written anywhere other than in the container mark or identification section of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in that section indicating where the code s is listed example container mark or identification primary code marks on reverse side of score sheet case corrections when an entry on a score tally sheet requires correction the only approved method is to draw a single line through the error write the correct entry next to the error and initial the correction white out is not allowed if the date of the correction is different from the date of the score tally sheet show the date of the correction example recording data follow the directions as shown in aim inspection series technical procedures manual which references procedures for recording weights vacuum readings and headspace when recording analytical data on the score tally sheet use the correct units of measure for

the following guidance is intended to assist policy writers to develop policy documents and should be read in conjunction with the policy document template summary table all the important information relating to the policy should be displayed at the top of the policy document so that it is easily accessible for the reader this information should include the policy title date of approval effective date date for review name of the policy officer policy title where possible the first word of the title should refer to the substance of the policy this will assist the reader access the policy from the policy a z e g accreditation of prior learning policy rather than policy on the accreditation of prior learning structure information should be presented in a logical sequence to assist the reader policy writers should use the section structure provided within the template but may create sub headings if necessary context may contain some contextual or background information and may include a sentence on how the policy supports the university s strategic plan definitions if necessary include an explanation of terms or abbreviations used within the policy and procedure where there are existing definitions of the terms in other university regulations or policy those definitions should be used purpose a concise statement on why the policy exists and what is its intent this statement should not contain background information or detailed explanations and should be suitable to act as a summary for viewing on the policy a z prior to the user reviewing the whole document scope specify the parameters of the policy which university cohort does the policy apply to this section should also reference any exclusions from the operation of the policy policy principles principles should provide broad directional information and the rationale for the policy by embodying the university s expected outcomes of its application roles and responsibilities some policies may require the articulation of roles to be undertaken by those responsible for applying the policy outline the university s expectations and detail the responsibilities of relevant parties process optional detailed operational procedures are separate from policy documents however some procedural information may be appropriately provided in the policy document particularly with regard to academic decision making policy toolkit guidelines for completion of policy documents document management policy documents and appendices are structured and presented consistently using the policy document template document control during the development stage there may be a number of people contributing to the development of a draft policy and so document version control is very important it is the responsibility of the policy officer to keep track of the developing drafts of the document via a continuously updated master document version numbers should be used to signify each revised version of the draft and a record of summarised revisions should be kept by the policy officer document version history all policy documents should include a comprehensive revision list at the end of the document this should chart the formal approval route and note any changes proposed by university committees this version history should remain on the published policy document and be updated following any subsequent changes to the policy style when drafting policy documents it is useful to bear in mind that different audiences are likely to access the policy and that policy users are not necessarily subject matter experts and may be accessing information on a topic for the first time it is important that policy documents are written in a clear and concise manner using plain english and avoiding jargon to ensure consistency of style and presentation those drafting policy documents are asked to consider the following use the policy document template use plain english and simple short sentences main headings and paragraphs should be numbered sequentially to facilitate referencing policy should be directive in style and therefore words such as will and must are appropriate to create a recognisable identity for policy documents a uniform format should be used font arial headings in bold and paragraphs separated by one line space policies should be as succinct as possible

are transferred between bank accounts approved transfer documents are authorised and maintained on the treasury file transactions are denoted daily on the daily cash sheets the treasury management spreadsheet is updated on a monthly basis for accrued interest amounts deposit control accounts are prepared on a monthly basis by the finance administrator and approved by the financial controller on a monthly basis confirmation of deposits received from the bank are compared to the deposit control account spreadsheet on a monthly basis and issues identified are queried by the finance administrator and the relevant bank on maturity all deposit interest figures are calculated and verified with relevant banks all queries in relation to any deposit interest calculation are clarified directly with the bank the financial system is updated on a monthly basis for interest received in the relevant month interest accruals are posted at the end of each financial year borrowings borrowing guaranteeing and underwriting shall be in carried out in accordance with the framework for borrowing and loan guarantees laid down in the code of governance for irish universities the university will ensure that all borrowing and loan transactions take place in accordance with the objects and functions of the university and the university s strategic plan in addition the level of borrowing shall not impinge on the university s ability to meet its annual servicing cost nor its ability to maintain financial and operational viability any proposals for long term borrowing for funding of projects will be evaluated by the bursar in line with the university s financial plan and the objectives of this policy and will not be undertaken without an express decision of the governing authority it will normally be expected that several sources of funds will be evaluated in each case appropriate interest rate hedging through fixed rates caps and other non aggressive instruments will be undertaken to protect the university from sharp increases in interest rates on borrowings any subsequent refinancing of a borrowing arrangement will be considered if the terms are competitive and as favourable as can reasonably be achieved in the light of market conditions prevailing at the time and will require approval by the governing authority in exceptional circumstances projects may be funded or part funded from cash balances held by the university in these instances an appropriate interest rate shall be repayable as approved by the governing authority following consideration by the university executive and the appropriate sub committee of the governing authority in striking an interest rate in these circumstances the governing authority will have regard to the feasibility of the project the loss of commercial deposit interest receivable and the long term financial sustainability of the university electronic fund transfers the university s long term strategy is to complete all transactions via electronic banking and eliminate all cheque transactions and minimise cash transactions where electronic payments occur all transfers and direct debit payments will only be initiated and authorised by mandated personnel supporting documentation will be retained where moneys are received by the university via electronic means e g realex mycard etc relevant finance office personnel will perform monthly reconciliations of bank accounts and control accounts to ensure that monetary amounts are reconciled agreed to supporting documentation where available and posted to the appropriate ledger account incoming cash and cheques until such time as cash and cheques are eliminated any cheques received through the mail and opened by the bursars office are forwarded to the income fees office any cash receivable into a department outside of the bursars income office should be remitted to income fees office indicating a reference to a relevant business unit with relevant dockets from a departmental remittance book cash receipts should be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation only irish drafts postal orders euro cheques or cash should be accepted foreign drawn cheques incur substantial collection fees which may make them uneconomical to lodge daily cash sheets are maintained to indicate the summary of all cash lodgments to the bank cash received through mycard vending machines is collected twice weekly by an outside cash handling security company and lodged directly into the mycard current bank account banking of other cash and cheques should be done at least twice a week foreign exchange generally the university will seek to keep transactions involving foreign currency to a minimum and will seek wherever possible to have transactions conducted in euro rather than foreign currency the university will not hold foreign currency except in the anticipation of related expenditure or onward payment for currencies where there are both extensive purchases and sales the university will keep under review whether to open foreign currency bank accounts in order to reduce transaction costs where external service providers are appointed in relation to foreign exchange transactions their work will be checked by the finance team in all circumstances the university will retain full responsibility for day to day treasury matters and for the safeguarding of its funds

products are re inspected in order to issue either an up to date certificate or an appeal certificate frequently the applicant doesn t question the quality and condition of the lot but needs a current certificate in order to satisfy a buyer seller contract occasionally the quality of previously inspected merchandise is questioned by a financially interested party and they request an appeal inspection inspection certificates are accepted as prima facie evidence of the facts contained within although it is division policy to assign only one grade representing a specific lot as a whole there have been cases involving the perishable agricultural commodities act paca in which both the plaintiff and defendant produced usda certificates each with a different grade it is very difficult to settle such claims unless the grade on one certificate can be reversed there should be no conflicting certificates on the lot unless the quality of the lot has changed due to age storage handling or other condition factors if such a change has taken place the original certificate is valid for the date of original inspection and the later certificate is also valid for the date of the later inspection these instructions will address such situations a formal appeal inspections if possible formal appeal inspections should be discouraged an appeal may often be avoided by having the inspector or supervisor review a few samples of the product with the applicant he or she can explain why the sample units were assigned a certain grade or why certain factors were evaluated as they were if the applicant requests a formal appeal the inspection should be handled as outlined in the regulations for appeal inspections these instructions supplement the regulations filing for appeal an appeal inspection may be requested by any financially interested party who is not satisfied with the results of the inspection as represented by a certificate on the lot in question they may file for an appeal provided a the lot of processed products can be identified as the same lot previously inspected b the request is within days of the previous inspection this period may be extended by the regional or national offices and c the complaint concerns a factor s which would not be a result of a change in a condition factor s since the previous inspection see section below sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the division will issue an appeal certificate when it has been established that the previous inspection is in error the original certificate is reversed and copies of the appeal certificate are sent to all financially interested parties denying request for appeal requests for an appeal inspection may be denied under the following circumstances a the complaint concerns a factor which may have undergone a change of condition since the original inspection such as oxidation of frozen fruits severe de tinning of apple sauce or other canned product hydrogen swells or other types of spoilage frozen broccoli or asparagus spears that are shattered due to possible mishandling flavor deterioration of canned citrus juice due to long storage at high temperatures and severe dehydration of frozen vegetables b the lot cannot be identified c the first inspection certification was based on restricted sampling for an example of a certificate showing restricted sampling see the aim inspection series certification manual d code marks do not agree with the original inspection e count does not agree with the original certificate there are certain exceptions to this provision if the original certificate covered a large lot and the re inspection covers a substantial quantity of merchandise an appeal on a portion of the original certificate may be granted provided that there is no question about identity however an appeal would not be granted on a very small segment of the original quantity for example if the quantity would be substantially less than the quantity represented by a single sample unit on the original inspection f lot is not accessible for proper sampling g if there has been a revision to the grade standards between the two sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of inspections and such revision would affect the grade assigned to the product h the original certificate is grade not certified gnc account unsanitary conditions of the plant or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material for example a frog or mouse may be found in a container during the original inspection plant conditions may warrant a gnc certificate even though this incident is strictly accidental it would be most unlikely that a re inspection of the lot would find another frog or mouse however the division would not deem it advisable to completely ignore previous production or inspection history and reverse the original inspection certificate i reasons for appeal are inadequate or frivolous for example i just don t trust the inspectors in the location office j when it is not in the interest of usda to perform the appeal this is a broad category and the national office would need to evaluate all facts in order to render an appropriate decision even if denied an appeal inspection due to any of these reasons the applicant may request a re inspection or an up to date inspection on the lot in question the result of this new inspection would establish the grade of the lot except that no grade would be assigned if usda records show that the original certificate was gnc account unsanitary processing conditions or use of unsound or unwholesome raw material see h above performing the appeal a information required the application may be made orally or in writing if made orally it must be confirmed in writing it must include the location of the lot the reason s for the appeal the date and serial number of the certificate covering the original inspection of the product and the name of issuing office sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b sampling the sampling rate on an appeal inspection should be at least the next sample size larger than the normal sampling rate for the lot size based on the single sampling plan in other words if the sample size in the regulations would normally be for the size of lot involved at least sample units would be drawn on the same lot for an appeal inspection if the applicant merely requests an up to date inspection and it is not known until the sample is examined that an appeal is in order as determined by the division the certificate should not be issued until additional sample units are drawn since stratification can occur in large containers at least a portion of samples of bulk container lots such as pound frozen should be full containers for example frozen strawberries may contain rocks that would tend to settle to the bottom of the can during handling prior to freezing a subsample from the top or center of the can is not likely to reveal the presence of this type of foreign material c who may perform the appeal inspection any inspector other than the inspector who performed the original inspection may perform an appeal inspection whenever practical two inspectors who are thoroughly familiar with the product should be assigned to conduct the appeal if one inspector starts the inspection and the need to issue an appeal inspection certificate doesn t become evident until the inspection is partially complete a second inspector should be called in to confirm the results d notify the regional and national offices if a formal appeal is filed or if during a routine re inspection procedure it appears that an appeal is in order notify the regional and national offices they may require a few samples to verify the new inspection results e examination of product because of the economic significance of the appeal all samples of the product should be very carefully graded and checked for all factors if objective tests are available they should be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of f gnc ordinarily an appeal would not be granted because of unsanitary plant or product conditions where the original inspection findings make an appeal unjustified see h on page fees a appeal fees are as follows grade sustained charge regular fee plus expenses grade reversed no charge for inspection but charge applicant for expenses incurred in sampling or shipping samples note an appeal certificate reversing the original inspection can only be issued after receiving authority from the national office if the inspection results indicate that this is the case submit details to the regional office the regional office will confer with the national office before results are reported or a certificate is issued certification see the aim inspection series certification manual for specific information related to the certification of appeals and re inspections sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of bulk containers frozen products packed in used containers used pound metal and or plastic containers with friction type lids are refilled by some processors of frozen foods reused containers must be clean at time of refilling obtain a letter of conformance from the processor stating that the containers were not previously used for non food products products filled into unsanitary containers are to be classed as grade not certified gnc it may be difficult to accurately describe reused containers some of these may have been used several times and appear to be old abused or otherwise damaged they may bear an assortment of code marks and label statements certification statements regarding used containers may be found in the aim inspection series certification manual note reused containers are not acceptable for government purchases state federal and department of defense unless specified in the contract or solicitation do not certify without a written waiver unless specified in the contract tote bins many packers use large bulk containers called tote bins for frozen vegetables these bins are used during the packing season to store frozen vegetables for repack at a later date the bins vary in size and construction but can hold as much as a ton of product for financial reasons users of tote bins need to know whether or not the product is free flowing or frozen in a solid mass the type of pack should always be shown in the body of the inspection certificate a free flowing describes a pack in which the individual units of the pack are not frozen together in a solid mass but may be easily separated into individual units there may be some crusting on the interior surface of the tote bin or a few clumps of units frozen together within the container but these can be separated with moderate pressure b solid mass describes a pack in which the individual units of the product in the container are predominantly or entirely frozen together in a solid mass such product will require additional cost in repacking the product due a special break up step in the process for the purpose of inspection and certification a lot can be a group of tote bins or a single tote bin tote bins must be properly identified for future re inspection segregation etc codes should be at least inch in height and stamped on the tote bins or on tags placed in upper right or left hand corner of the side normally facing the fork lift driver the area for applying the codes may be painted to facilitate application and legibility sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of the coding system may include the following plant when more than plant is operated by the same company quality designation date of pack day month and year product type style size etc when not readily apparent such as covered bins or numerous product styles period shift or lot number bin numbers special notation of abnormal quality variations i e grade b for color only etc different colored tape tags or marking ink for different quality levels or other special notations to determine the sampling rate for an item packed in tote bins or bulk storage the poundage is converted to institutional size pound containers using the number of pound containers the lot would represent refer to the regulations or the aim inspection series sampling manual when sampling tote bins use a sample scoop and dig into the product as far as possible in at least locations the sample drawn from each of the three locations may be considered as a sample unit for inspection and certification if each tote bin is a separate lot it may be composited as one sample unit if the lot consists of a group of tote bins sampling may be more representative with the use of a trier or thief which will penetrate deeply into each bin this implement should be constructed to permit sampling of the product from all levels in the bin if the product is a solid mass or if representative portions of the bin cannot be sampled the certificate should be flagged to indicate the extent of restricted sampling for restricted certification of tote bins see the aim inspection series certification manual sci division inspection series

procedures the order of examination for quality analytical and microanalyses is much the same for most products generally factors that are affected by exposure to the air are evaluated first such as color for some products such as jams jellies and applesauce consistency is the first consideration another general rule is to make the physical and organoleptic examination before analytical and micro tests cooking or any other tests that do not require the product to be intact or that would not be affected by the results of other testing familiarity with the product its grade standard and any additional grading instructions is essential in starting grading procedures the color factor is more critical in some products such as mushrooms and sweet potatoes but in all cases there is a tendency for product to become dull and somewhat darkened on exposure to air color should be evaluated soon as possible after the container is opened after obtaining net weights be alert for any abnormal product or container characteristics upon opening containers a in the case of dried fruits look for darkening sugaring etc b for jams and jellies check for mold in the head space area in low moisture fruits and fruit juice crystals or powder look for caking c for frozen product look for abnormal appearance color and or odor observe amount of frost ice crystals layer of ice dehydration shattered or broken units as in broccoli and asparagus d for canned product look for darkening in the head space area particularly with light colored products such as applesauce e also visually check the head space of canned fruits and vegetables often the actual measurement is unnecessary since the can is obviously filled to more than percent of its capacity as a general rule check the headspace of any sample units that have a low net weight or appear to have a low content level this is done easily with a head space gauge f after emptying cans to determine fill of container and or drained weight check metal cans for internal defects such as severe detinning or rust sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining net contents a definitions gross weight is the weight of the packaged unit including both the food and the primary container tare or tare weight is the weight of the empty clean dry primary container in which the food is packaged net

is adequate for most grading purposes in some instances greater sensitivity may be necessary for example it may be necessary to weigh small packages in gram units rather than ounces individual procedures for specific products will incorporate such requirements check scales frequently to verify that they are accurate and in proper working order a standardized weight or set of calibrated

weights exactly if using a mechanical scale read to the higher mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and the weight of the tare can is between and ounces read the weight as ounces when the tare has been established the tare bar may be adjusted accordingly and the net weights can be read directly if there is no predetermined tare take gross weights first and determine the tare weight after containers are empty clean and dry record net weight by subtracting the tare weight from the gross weight gross net and drained weight read to the lower mark for example if the scale is graduated in tenths of an ounce and if a package of asparagus weights between and ounces read as ounces d taking net weights place containers on the scale in the center of the pan for an accurate reading if there is any residue on the containers such as frost on the exterior surfaces of frozen food packages remove such material before weighing sci division inspection series general procedures

available that are accurately calibrated for measuring volume of liquids the flask is calibrated for volume of a liquid at a standard temperature usually degrees c the legend is etched on each flask the fluid product being measured must be at this temperature for accuracy it is also important to avoid incorporating air into the liquid when filling the flask to do so always pour the liquid slowly down the side of the flask heavier products such as tomato juice nectars etc must stand after filling the flask to permit any trapped air to escape determining tare weight these procedures applies to all types of primary containers cans glass fiber etc except polyethylene or other thin plastic film when the weight of the primary container is quite uniform and is a very small percentage of the total gross weight in such uniform light weight poly bags a single bag from the lot may be used as the tare when the tare involves cartons the liquid from frozen products such as frozen sliced strawberries soaks into the fiber during the freezing period rather than using new or air dried cartons use soaked cartons wiped with a dry towel to determine the tare for such a lot sci division

average weight of the heaviest of the containers as the tare c in plant inspection option average tare select at random empty containers and lids and weigh them collectively if possible use the average weight from these containers as the tare make this tare determination at least once per day normally early in the shift and again at any time there is a change in the supply of containers d in plant inspection option pre weighed tare weigh the tare containers and mark these containers with their respective weights or identify the containers with the tare weight recorded on the worksheet pass these pre weighed tare containers through the filler and capture them after a point where there is no further chance to alter the fill subtract the appropriate tare weight from the gross weight to determine the net weight of each container e in plant inspection option heaviest tare in some instances the plant may wish to use the heaviest of the weighed cans as tare or if in line control is based on subgroups of for example cans the heaviest of the may be used as the tare this option should only be used when the plant requests such restrictive control sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of determining drained weight tare a dry empty mesh sieve except use a mesh sieve for canned tomatoes use the inch diameter sieve for smaller capacity containers and the inch diameter sieve for larger containers rest one edge of the tared sieve on the side of a grading tray approximately inches deep this will produce a sieve slope angle of about to degrees distribute the product evenly on the screen except for canned spinach which is not spread on the screen drain for two minutes without disturbing the product except to invert halves of fruit that are obviously holding pockets of syrup at the end of two minutes place the sieve on the scale and read the drained weight directly to expedite grading and examination of the product it is ideal to have several sieves standardized to a particular weight this can be done through careful selection of sieves and the addition of solder or stainless steel washers and wire to increase the lighter sieves to the weight of the heaviest by using a single tare on the scale standardized sieve weights will allow multiple drained weight samples to be weighed sequentially at the end of the two minute draining period do not re tare the sieves after the first weighing any slight residue remaining on the mesh is considered a part of drained weight re taring the sieve would offset this small increment of weight however the sieve should be washed if there is excessive build up of material and syrup this is often seen when draining canned apples for example grade or compliance determination when inspection for quality is based on any u s grade standard with a scoring system there is an allowance for samples that fall below the quality of the indicated grade lot sizes range from sample

point where the physical characteristics and quality will not be altered by any further hand or mechanical means but may be subject to further processing such as final freezing line checks for grade determination are considered official samples they provide a record of what has happened during the packing shift they keep the inspector and the processor informed of conditions during processing and helps the processor keep quality at the desired level the number of line check samples examined will depend on the sampling plan in effect at a particular processing plant see the aim inspection series sampling manual for on line sampling procedures use approved score sheets and tally sheets for recording inspection results the ams forms catalog which may be found at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx contains a list of approved score sheets and tally sheets see the score sheet and tally sheet section of this manual for guidelines on the development approval and completion of plant specific score sheets whenever possible make samples available for examination by plant officials and supervisors after grading this affords the inspector an opportunity to discuss any pertinent observations or changes needed during production and encourages communication between all parties the plant supervisors and subordinate inspectors a line checks for grade determination of finished product samples of the finished product are taken after processing is complete and no further change in quality is likely to occur samples are selected on a random basis so that each sample unit has an equal chance of being selected if the production rate is reasonably uniform spaced sampling intervals during a set period of packing time will generally produce good lot representation if the rate of production fluctuates considerably the sampling interval should be adjusted accordingly regardless of production patterns inspectors must not be too predictable in their sampling intervals such predictability may allow for processor manipulation timed to temporarily improve the product at the anticipated sample selection time this may be more of a problem if the grading site is located far away from the processing lines and in view of the production workers line check personnel would be seen while on their way to draw samples in time for workers to intensify their efforts to improve quality the inspector s goal is to draw samples that accurately reflect the quality of the product and such samples are not representative of the lot samples of finished product should receive all the same processing and handling as the lot which they represent and should ideally be taken from the location of the stored lot if this is not practical due to the size of the facility or location of storage consult your supervisor for guidance sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of b line checks of unprocessed product line checks of samples prior to final processing give the inspector and the processor an immediate picture of the likely finished product quality the processor can promptly implement correction procedures if needed to improve subsequent production these line checks are generally considered official samples that are used to help determine the final grade of the product since they are not processed all unprocessed line check sample units from the canning line must be opened immediately after the sample units are drawn samples drawn at this stage are limited in the extent to which they fully reflect finished product inspectors must examine samples of the finished product before assigning a final grade regardless of the number of line check samples evaluated samples of the finished product should be taken from the same location as the stored lot to ensure that they received the same processing and handling as the lot they represent in some cases this will not be practical especially in large canneries if not finished samples may be taken at the end of the processing line at proper intervals if needed consult your supervisor for guidance for a quality assurance or qap type contract only finished product is used for verifying reliability there are many important reasons for examining the finished product the lot is subject to further handling and processing after line checks are examined character in many products may be adversely affected by rough handling or overcooking canned foods may be overcooked or undercooked frozen foods may not be completely frozen the color of the product may deteriorate because of improper processing or may be improved by heat exchange and equalization oxidation and pinking will sometimes be prominent in certain products after processing even though not apparent in the raw product bruises in the raw product often diminish or disappear after heat processing frozen fruits may develop considerable oxidation between the line check and freezing operation adulteration by foreign material is possible if various fruit products are held too long in warm weather after sugaring and packaging higher mold counts may be found in samples after freezing than were found in line sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of check samples objectionable material may be introduced where packing medium is added at a point after line checks are taken improper cooling may cause external rust on canned foods soon after processing cooker jams or rough handling may dent many cans in the lot under certain conditions cans may panel or buckle after improper cooling after freezing and the resulting expansion frozen foods in packing media may show poor condition because of leakers liquid may soak through and discolor primary containers of some frozen foods if held too long in the containers before freezing dried foods may be excessively moist in containers with faulty seals it may be necessary to disregard line check indications and base the final grade of the product entirely on examination of finished product samples in this situation the line check score sheets should include an explanation about why they were considered unreliable c incomplete grade a final grade cannot be determined without finished product inspection if inspection results are only available from unprocessed line checks an incomplete grade ig may be established by supplementing line check results with any other factors affecting quality of which the inspector is aware experience with the product is the key to determining accurate incomplete grades products bearing approved identification must be completely inspected and assigned a final grade issue only incomplete grades on lots that have been shipped before finished product samples can be drawn unless official inspection can be completed at the point where the lots arrive never issue a final grade based on a few cases left from a lot that has been shipped unless the certificate covers only those few cases remaining if part of a lot is shipped before samples can be drawn assign an incomplete grade to the shipped portion and a final grade to the remaining portion noting complete details on the score sheets and daily inspection reports involved if sufficient finished product sample units are later examined from a lot previously assigned an incomplete grade and if they indicate lot quality to be higher or lower than the incomplete grade the final grade is based on the examination of finished product samples

been sorted out of the regular pack this is particularly true with rtp cherries strawberries and other berries although we do not wish to encourage this type of inspection we also have no grounds for refusing to inspect a product according to u s standards quite often the question is whether the grade should be substandard or whether the product is gnc or there may be a buyer specification and we need to determine if the product meets that specification for these situations use the following guidelines a be sure to check the product for foreign material as indicated in the aim inspection series foreign material manual b even if the product meets the buyer s specification it should also be on hold for re examination account foreign material where examination for filth indicates the product might exceed the guidelines then proceed in accordance with aim inspection series foreign material manual c if the product is frozen in bulk such as barrels certification and inspection should

restrict foreign material examination to one factor such as mold count leaving other applicable filth analyses undetermined reporting results a reporting inspection results it s crucial to report result to the plant in a timely manner to the processor this is one of the main advantages of having in plant inspection plant employees designated to receive reports must be identified for new inspectors an individual line check sample that is below desired quality should be reported immediately to the designated plant contact so he or she may take any necessary corrective action this person is usually a qa or qc manager or technician it s a good policy to note on the line check sheet both the name of the plant contact and the time the notification was given after verbal reporting written notification is usually provided to the plant in three ways notification to the designated plant contact person immediately after results are obtained the inspector should establish a daily routine for sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of reporting grading results to the person responsible for placing lots into storage for example writing the grade of each item packed on the warehouse manager s copy of the pack report or plant production report copies of the score sheets if desired copies of the daily inspection report b reporting special cases products that are grade not certified or fail fda standards or fail requirements pertaining to the use of approved identification on the label marks all require special reporting procedures the plant will want to prevent recurrence and to make sure these items are not inadvertently shipped or mixed with like items in the warehouse a letter should be written to the responsible plant official according to division regulations the designated plant individual responsible for hold disposition should sign the letter and enter the date received four copies of the letter should be

equipment when sampling and sanitation requirements dictate follow the plant s procedures for lock out tag out procedures and do not place your hands or any body part within the confines of operating equipment at all times safety first b inspection of products processed elsewhere there may be times when plant management purchases a processed fruit or vegetable for resale or further processing the inspector should honor an occasional request by the plant to inspect and or certify such a product provided that the product was not officially inspected before there should be no additional charge for this service unless the inspector s workday is lengthened in the process however if the plant inspector is not proficient in grading the product or if the plant facilities lack necessary inspection equipment plant management should be advised to request that the product be inspected under lot inspection on a fee basis through the area oic c in plant tanker inspection and sealing a good sanitation and sealing program is crucial to maintaining the quality level and integrity of the product the processor shipper is responsible for the sanitary conditions of tankers product loading off loading and sealing sci responsibilities are limited to grading and related inspection activities this includes monitoring tanker sanitation assigning product grade assisting in proper sealing and documentation of inspection results sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of plant s role a notify inspector if tanker sealing is requested and if any sealing requirements are specified b provide adequate lighting and the tools necessary to provide tanker inspection c provide a sanitary loading facility and a clean tanker capable of being properly sealed d make valves accessible for inspection properly load the tanker insure proper sealing and provide acceptable seals usda seals may be used in lieu of company seals e determine acceptable packer s risk in respect to loading tanker based on tankers back haul record f ensure that occupational safety and health administration osha requirements are addressed sci s role a monitor and conduct sanitation checks of equipment and tankers for proper sanitation b document and report unacceptable sanitation conditions to management c notify management of tankers that cannot be properly sealed tanker condition and loading sites although not required it is recommended that the loading area be sheltered from the weather in unsheltered locations the load may be contaminated by objects falling into the product or insects and foreign objects intruding into uncovered loading nozzles product shall not be loaded unless the tanker has been inspected the loading equipment must be clean verification of these conditions is a responsibility jointly shared by both processor and inspector sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of prior to loading the designated plant person should obtain a wash ticket from the transport company prior to acceptance for loading these are usually attached to the rear port the ticket may be examined to confirm acceptable previous back hauls adequate washing and trailer identification if the tanker is to be sealed it should be determined that it can be properly sealed during the pre loading sanitation check properly sealed means that the openings are sealed to prevent access to the product sealing requires tight seals and secure fittings and should meet customer specifications tanker inspection a safety precautions usda personnel should never enter the tanker entry into a closed tanker requires a confined space permit see the regulations cfr found at the following internet address http www gpo gov fdsys browse collectioncfr action collectioncode cfr this is required by the occupational safety and health administration osha and is the responsibility of the industry to provide when a tanker is presented for inspection usda personnel shall allow plant personnel to break seals and open lids before performing inspections at no time will usda personnel enter a tanker b inspection of tanker parts use a flashlight to inspect the tanker visually inspect lids valves fittings vent covers gaskets and openings look inside the tank both to the front and to the rear through the dome lid examine for any product residue indicating an unclean surface loose equipment and helmets should be secured or removed before approaching any openings c wash water when residual wash or rinse water is present it should be drained from the tanker it may be checked for metal shavings detergent residue and traces of product tankers are not expected to be completely dry and may contain some amount of clean water in the absence of residual water the dry surface of the rear valve may be checked for residues a magnet may be used on the residue if the presence of metal shavings is suspected sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when unacceptable conditions exist such as metal shavings detergent and or residues product and or residues and or mold residues the tanker must be rejected until properly cleaned if it is determined that the tanker is not clean any product loaded would be grade not certified d ability to seal in controlled situations it may not be necessary to remove all seals otherwise remove the seals and open rear side or under tank assemblies dust cover plunger and cap to product lines top dome lids and vent caps all access areas should be inspected for the ability to seal when the tanker cannot be properly sealed notify the applicant note when the applicant has requested tanker sealing and the tanker cannot be properly sealed but the processor elects to ship without seals the appropriate inspection documents will show tanker cannot be properly sealed incoming tankers with product acceptable verification and product receiving procedures should be established between in plant inspectors and plant personnel verification should include trailer identity and a review of inspection documents with seal numbers when applicable note acceptance or rejection of product is at the receiver s discretion sci inspectors will consider the product as officially graded if the usda documents accompanying the load are consistent with the load identity regardless of whether or not applied seals are intact sealing loaded tankers when sealing is requested and proper sealing is completed seal numbers shall be recorded on the score sheet and other appropriate inspection documents all previous seals shall be replaced with new seals except under controlled situations when tankers are being used for continuous loading and off loading for example if the tanker remains within acceptable conditions while operating back and forth between inspection sites only the seals necessary for on and off loading need to be changed this decision is a joint responsibility between the shipper and the trucking company the inspector will monitor verification of seals that remain intact throughout the operation sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a dome area the top dome should be sealed with at least two seals placed on opposite sides of the hatch lid if the hinge can be removed additional seals may be necessary b lower areas after the processor has properly secured valves and closed the covers the access door will be sealed on tankers that have all valves inside a locked box after the processor has closed the valve and installed the dust cover and retainer nut the dust cover will be sealed on tankers with rear or lower valves with dust covers c vents to be considered properly sealed all vents must be equipped so that seals may be installed other areas of concern a temperature product temperatures can be verified during the loading process as specified by standards or other applicable specifications results will be recorded on appropriate inspection documents b score sheets the score sheet and certificate confirm that the product in the tanker is the product that has been inspected d syrup designations syrup designation is based on brix readings determined on equalized product that is after the equalization of the natural sugars in the fruit and sugars in the in going packing medium for the inspection purposes of canned fruits in syrup equalization is considered complete days after packing however rather than delay inspection for the day time needed for this process equalization may be achieved by comminuting all of the product and all of the packing medium together this is known as simulated equalization see the brix section in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual for additional information on simulated equalization procedures sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of simulated equalization compliance of each item with a specified syrup designation shall be determined on a shift basis on samples drawn at regular intervals entire individual containers must be blended for each determination a sampling sample units may be drawn from the processing line at any point after the seaming operation and preferably where they emerge from the cooking and cooling operation samples for simulated equalization may be obtained as follows the same container that is used for grade determination may be used for brix determination if all fruit and syrup can be retrieved for comminuting after quality factors have been determined loss of either fruit or syrup component will lead to inaccurate results separate containers may be drawn from the line for brix determination only b sampling frequency the sampling frequency for brix determination is based on the required number of sample units needed to meet the on line sampling rate in the regulations and knowledge of previous production at least three determinations must be made refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual for information regarding time sampling plans that cover non quality factors sampling frequency shall be as follows low volume one sample unit per to minutes medium volume one sample unit per minutes high volume one sample unit per minutes no change in sampling frequency is necessary unless production for three consecutive basic production periods production shift indicates a change from one volume designation to another c sub group samples if the plant wants more than one determination each time for example sub groups of two the number of sub groups shall be equal to or exceed one third of the number of sample units required sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of by the regulations on line sampling plan do not average the two readings each container must meet the acceptance criteria as shown in acceptance criteria on the following page d lateral samples lateral samples may be drawn at the option of the plant however these samples may be used only for the plant s guidance or to confirm rejection of a lot they may not be used to determine compliance with the average specified as shown under acceptance criteria e sampling failed lots if a lot fails because of low average brix or insufficient sample units less than minimum number required the lot may be rejected however the packer has the option to request that additional containers be drawn throughout the lot to make up to at least the minimum required for on line in plant inspection if the inspector elects to draw more than this minimum it shall be in increments as outlined in the regulations i e f general procedure record the net weights when line samples are in the laboratory this information may be valuable to the processor since to some extent low or high net weights influence the final brix readings cool the samples to approximately degrees f before opening if they are available use several blender bowls to save time in comminuting multiple samples designate each bowl for use on those products that are consistently close in degrees brix after one sample unit is comminuted it may be poured back into its original container the bowl should be completely drained before another sample unit is comminuted continue this procedure until all containers are blended and the comminuted product s is ready for refractometer readings leave the bowls inverted after brix measurements have been completed or wash with hot water and thoroughly dry before each use g communication when a brix determination is below the required value immediately notify the proper designated plant official record the name of this plant employee and the time of notification on work sheet or score sheet sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of if requested check additional blends and record these additional values in a separate column on blend sheet or work sheet these would be considered lateral samples and cannot be used to erase results of official samples day equalization to bring a lot up to date fifteen days or more after pack measure the brix on all sample units using techniques described in the aim inspection series technical procedures manual incorporate these readings with the original blend readings if they confirm the original results if these readings fail to confirm the original results make a full inspection for brix at the appropriate single sampling rate and certify on this basis disregarding the readings obtained by simulated equalization acceptance criteria a code or group of codes may be considered separately from other codes in a shift if it meets the full single sampling rate to be considered acceptable the re sampled portion must meet the requirements listed below portions that fail to meet these requirements are rejected a simulated equalization the average brix of the sample must be within the range of the specified syrup designation except as indicated in paragraph a no individual sample unit may be below the range of the next lower or above the next higher syrup designation if no lower designation exists none may fall more than degrees brix below the minimum of the specified syrup designation not more than three successive brix readings on sample units drawn at regular intervals may be below the minimum or above the maximum for the specified designation if an individual container fails paragraph a draw three additional containers representing the production of approximately the same time period record results on blend or work sheet adjacent to the low sample unit use these additional three test results to appraise the status of the sub group period as follows sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of a if or more of the additional three brix readings are below the minimum or above the maximum requirement for the intended syrup designation reject the period code b if no more than one of these additional three brix readings is below the minimum or above the maximum the period is accepted or failed based on evaluation of the entire shift b day equalization the average brix must be within the range of the specified syrup designation no individual may be below the range of the next lower or above the next higher syrup designation if no lower designation exists none may fall more than degrees brix below the minimum of the specified syrup designation in plant inspectors filing system a list of key management and plant personnel names should be kept on file for ready access by new inspection personnel since title and structure of management levels differ between plants the lists may vary accordingly the form and style should be based on plant management structure and chain of command include names of plant contact individuals on each shift since many inspectors go from plant to plant it is important that the filing systems be relatively uniform to minimize confusion for inspectors this system consists of two basic parts a yearly file and a permanent file in many plants these files may be adequately housed in a single file drawer larger plants requiring a greater number of records may need a three drawer filing cabinet whatever type of storage is used it must be lockable the iic is allowed flexibility in establishing these files the inspector only needs to set up folders for those topics applying to the particular plant and

usda grade or inspection marks when reviewing product manufacturer labels the inspector must check for all issues that are required under the inspection agreement with industry contract if a state or federal statute requires certain label information and requires that product meet certain criteria for their special mark the inspector s review should include these criteria any deviations should be reported to plant management inspectors should not enter into any discussion or controversy over label statements that are under mandatory labeling regulations such as under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or applicable state laws and regulations however inspectors should be aware of any incidences of potentially deceptive or inaccurate labeling if you are directly aware of such an incident through knowledge of the plant s processes report it to your supervisor if processors distributors or others in private industry have questions about proper labeling they should be tactfully referred to the agency usually fda with authority on the subject for further label information see the labeling section of this manual although the national office approves the use of official label marks by the applicant the iic of a plant will be responsible for reviewing and verifying all labeling materials bearing approved identification questions or problems that cannot be resolved are to be directed through the normal chain of command when labels are completed and available at the plant they should be reviewed as far in advance of use as possible the ideal situation would be to review preliminary label sketches paste ups or proofs of proposed labels before they are manufactured this step could prevent significant errors and save the firm considerable expense and inconvenience whether materials are checked prior to manufacture or not inspectors should be sure to verify finished labels because there may have been changes since the initial review products packed or certified under contract in plant or lot inspection may bear certain types of approved identification these products must meet the requirements stated in the regulations and additional qualifications set forth within in plant

variety of ways a blocking out with an ink stamp frozen containers may be treated in this manner by wiping the spot with a dry rag and immediately stamping with a quick drying ink such as that used for felt tipped marking pens b blocking out with paper stickers c labeling over the offending label or overwrapping over the offending overwrap the label underneath must not show through d completely stripping the labels e replacing friction type lids or screw closure lids f in many instances of mislabeling it is possible to correct the label so that it complies with regulations and therefore eliminates the need for removal of approved identification the processor should be encouraged to do so whenever possible examples of these corrections are blocking out the word inaccurately describing a syrup density and ink stamping the correct word adjacent to the block blocking out the inaccurate net weight and inserting the correct net weight blocking out the word inaccurately describing style and inserting the correct word sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of give the processor written release acknowledge the removal or label correction and

and began operations march with the converting of an existing warehouse to a ripening and cold storage unit the fresh asparagus could be held in an atmosphere of highly moisturized air and at a temperature of less than degrees f this optimum condition prevented the rapid deterioration of the product and enabled the cannery to better utilize and maintain the quality and productive capacity of their plant the month of april produced ideal growing temperatures but operations were curtailed in the month of may due to unsatisfactory growing conditions imposed by cool and windy weather despite this development the operations progressed satisfactorily with the use of the molding room for the accumulation of the fresh product a sharp cent per pound increase was noted in this year s field price over last year with no apparent rise in the important midwest and atlantic coast producing areas contrary to earlier expectations all producing areas of the united states developed packs of canned asparagus this year that exceeded the year output elberta peaches because of large increase bearing acreage and better sizing early season reports showed an estimated total crop greater than any previous year but due to an abnormally heavy green crop the elberta tonnage picked out well below these pre season estimates however overall quality was substantially superior to last year s and with significant changes in the processing facilities the pack reflects a much higher proportion of better grades this same trend is indicated generally from other canneries and as a result the marketing of this year s pack is not expected to be as severely impacted by off grade merchandise as last year s the market for elbertas continues to be unsatisfactory however due largely to continued efforts to move the heavy carry overs of the year pack kadota figs the canning operations on kadota figs commenced on october but were curtailed by difficulties in attending the harvest in the latter stages of the season lower than normal temperatures and cool nights together with water shortages have resulted in a sharp overall drop off in production this in turn caused abnormally small sizes and below average quality as a result the final production fell below pre season expectations one problem encountered in the first weeks of processing was the heavy infestation of the raw product by dried fruit beetles this contamination was caused by poor field and harvesting methods by the farmer as a result of this condition the inspector found it necessary to suggest stringent changes in preliminary washing procedures management cooperated fully and after these improvements were made there were no further problems with the finished product sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of iv products processed cont tomatoes varying conditions in various producing areas of the state resulted in a rather confused picture for early production prospects it was evident that many of the older producing areas had experienced substantial reductions in acreage due largely to the unavailability or high rental of suitable land on the other hand major acreage expansion was reported in the westfield valley where new land was being put into production the cannery started production on the first of september but as the season progressed deliveries were not sufficient to permit continuous operations one of the features of the tomato operation was the gallon drum filling installation this facility fills each of the four drums with approximately pounds of percent solid tomato paste every minutes v sanitation general appearance and housekeeping the past year was exceptionally good the usual problems of running around the clock on certain products were encountered but generally speaking the sanitation and clean up was good the plant improved the sanitation condition of the plant because of three factors the first one was the message passed down the chain of command concerning the crucial role of good plant sanitation as well as the management of a plant sanitation program an effective program was implemented and plant employees did their parts to make it work the second factor was the installation and use of a multi drop high pressure low volume kobe pumping system throughout the processing area this helped keep hand cleaning down to a minimum and also reduced the cleaning time necessary for each area the third factor was the two shift approximately nine hour schedule that was maintained during the fruit processing season this allowed a clean up crew ample time to properly clean the plant vi major changes of facilities and equipment general installation of new boiler installation of three rotary type

the can some monitoring of the legibility of the code was necessary with adjustments made when needed the plant was made aware of the inkjet type system of coding to increase legibility this could be a more accurate method to help track inventory more precisely handling and warehousing of the finished product was efficient even though the company added warehouses two years ago anticipation of a bumper crop and inventory called for the use of outside storage of their product their storage and code tracking methods allow separate tracking of all five individual production lines sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of viii application of u s standards and inspector s instructions asparagus and figs no particular problem in applying the standards and instructions peaches the standards are difficult to apply with respect to grade d and below standards in quality specifically application of the off suture cut tolerance and uniformity of size rule are not uniform and do not reflect as poor a quality as indicated instructions should provide for standard sample sizes and uniform procedures tomatoes no problem with the standards except that no provisions are made for stemmed instructions should increase the tolerance on sprouted seeds on page no standards for chopped tomatoes with basil copy of buyer s specifications for the product attached approximately cases packed ix miscellaneous with the introduction of the can dispensing units this year the overall coding system for the cannery was improved by using a basic type die mark and different combinations of side marks the cook room could better utilize the full capacity of their cookers it also proved to be more efficient in the warehouse as a mere glance at the uncased merchandise could determine its particular style grade etc x housing for inspectors the plant is located approximately miles from the city limits where there are several hotels and restaurants available at moderate rates the most affordable accommodations are at a motel located a half mile from the plant the motel has been recently renovated and complies with the federal fire and safety act this proximity to the plant also saves mileage costs this availability makes the current per diem rate for this area adequate sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date

on labels using official marks will be brought to the processor s attention as will questionable labels observed in the course of inspection depending upon the nature of the deviation corrective action may be recommended or required various additives are sometimes used in the preparation of non standardized processed foods these additives such as acids salt sugar approved colorings calcium lactate etc are usually used during the manufacturing process for example some frozen vegetables may pass through brine separators during processing and accumulate trace amounts of salt in the finished product similarly citric acid may be used in the manufacture of canned apple sauce other examples include additives such as sugar coloring and calcium lactate sometimes used during the processing of french fried potatoes the use of these substances can pose a labeling problem because of the method of application the additive s may carry over to the finished product in negligible quantities this may seem to be inconsequential however since many of these products are not standardized under food and drug labeling requirements it is necessary to declare each ingredient including additives when used it is the responsibility of the packer to conform to fda requirements sci approval of labels with official marks does not relieve the company of this responsibility we will not

completion the purpose of this instruction is to provide guidelines for completing score sheets and tally sheets it is extremely important for score sheets and tally sheets to be complete accurate and legible often a score sheet is the primary means by which sci inspection results are communicated copies of score sheets and tally sheets are often requested by applicants and other financially interested parties and are frequently requested through the freedom of information act sci score sheets and tally sheets are official documents and may be introduced and accepted as evidence in litigation score sheets and tally sheets must be prepared so that the information shown is clear complete and accurate entries on score sheets and tally sheets must be based on facts observed and test results to preserve authenticity only officially approved versions of fruit and vegetable fv forms are to be used approved fv score sheets and tally sheets may not be manipulated manually or electronically do not alter original format or data approved versions of fv score sheets and tally sheets may be found in the ams forms catalog at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx each grader participating in the grading of a product is responsible for assuring that score tally sheets have all the necessary data entered correctly including accurate computations and assuring that all tests have been completed each grader will print and sign his her name on the score sheet s or tally sheet s the utmost care and diligence must be observed in the preparation of these official documents in the case of legal action inspectors may be subpoenaed by the court to testify to the accuracy of the score sheet tally sheet or resulting inspection certificate on which their signatures appear everyone from those who collect the data during inspection to those who are responsible for reviewing the work shares the responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of these documents a completing standardized score sheets and tally sheets sci policy is to record in the appropriate blocks on the score sheet or tally sheet the results of quantitative examinations analytical tests and actual quality level s observed during the grading of the product in variable grade point standards score sheets are used to assess product the overall quality factors are assigned a number and the final grade is determined in attribute standards a tally sheet is used to assess product prerequisite quality factors are examined quality factors are counted and the final grade is determined note when information that is common to both types of documents is described in this instruction the documents will be referred to as score tally sheets a thoroughly completed score tally sheet is one that has all the data required to support the grade of the product report each value in the appropriate sample unit sci division inspection series general procedures

sample unit it is not necessary to put dashes in boxes that are marked type style etc when it is clear that no values are required to be entered for each sample unit example style sliced count to

not include any personal opinions or assumptions on the score tally sheet score tally sheets must be complete accurate and legible the first step in completing a score tally sheet is locating the most up to date version available these forms are located in printable pdf format in the ams forms catalog the ams forms catalog is available at the following intranet address http agnis amsformscatalog forms allitems aspx click on the view box on the right of the screen for a drop down list then click on fruit and vegetable and scroll to the fv form number needed inspectors without intranet access may contact their immediate supervisor for assistance as needed note do not use the universal score sheet form fv when a product has a current standardized score tally sheet only use this form for products that do not have an applicable grade standard or for which a standardized score tally sheet is not currently available after selecting the appropriate score tally sheet enter the pre grading information this information is located on the application for inspection and certificate of sampling form fv or from in plant sources under in plant inspection the pre grading information may include but is not limited to complete name and address of applicant contract or purchase order number case count size and kind of container pertinent label information and type style or variety sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of it is helpful to the grader and anyone reviewing the score tally sheet to note the target values concerning quantitative examinations and or analytical tests for such parameters as net weight vacuum drained weight brix etc example net weight ounces min principal label marks record only essential label information on the score tally sheet essential label information includes brand name commodity name including type style count size syrup designation quality statement if any all references to net weight or drained weight or net contents country of origin and packers and or distributor s name and address additional printed data may be added to score tally sheets as long as the original score tally sheet data and format has not been altered it may be helpful to prepare a sort of template score tally sheet with added information for frequent applicants labels or other information verify this with your supervisor before preparing photocopying and using these templates with their pre printed information can be a time saver however if the score tally sheet has pre printed information added this information must be verified before continuing you must check to make sure that none of the information has changed since the score tally sheet template was prepared label information should be recorded exactly as found on the label if a container has extensive label markings and it is not possible to attach a label label markings may be shown on the reverse of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in the label section of the score tally sheet stating that label marks are listed on the reverse side it is permissible to write in the label section of the score tally sheet the brand name as shown on the label followed by the statement see attached label and attach a label in lieu of copying the label information onto the score tally sheet see the following example sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of example no size and kind of container ounce beaded body enamel lined metal cans label valley brand grape juice see attached label container mark or identification primary case sample codes when grading lot inspection samples containing numerous mixed codes it is helpful to sort and arrange the sample units logically alphabetically numerically and or chronologically this ensures that like codes are grouped together and codes are easier to track when transferred to the score tally sheet record code markings in the row titled container mark or identification within this row there are two separate rows identified as primary and case see the example above the u s standards for condition of food containers defines the primary container as the immediate container in which the product is packaged and which serves to protect preserve and maintain the condition of the product it may be metal glass fiber wood textile plastic paper or any other suitable type of material and may be supplemented by liners overwraps or other protective materials the case would then be considered the container in which the primary container is packaged in the case of bulk packed products the case may be the primary container as for example processed raisins in pound cases the case code marks for such products would be recorded in the area designated for primary codes there would be no entry for case codes accurately record the code markings on the score tally sheet code markings are to be recorded exactly as they are written on the container refer to the aim inspection series sampling manual and certification manual for examples of how to record code marks and allowable exceptions all marks and spaces have a significant meaning in the code and should be accurately recorded on the score tally sheet if a code includes a time designation or marking it must be recorded if the color of the ink used is part of the code marks record the color of the ink when repeating identical code marks use arrows to show sample units in the lot that have the identical primary or case code markings this is the only area on the score tally sheet that arrows may be used sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when codes contain excessive numbers letters or symbols and are too long to be legibly written within the space provided on the score tally sheet the codes may be shown on the reverse side codes will be identified by sample number and listed left to right just as they would appear on the front of the score tally sheet in the row entitled container mark or identification if there is only one code in the lot that exceeds the space provided on the score tally sheet the code may be written in the remarks section whenever a code mark is written anywhere other than in the container mark or identification section of the score tally sheet a notation must be made in that section indicating where the code s is listed example container mark or identification primary code marks on reverse side of score sheet case corrections when an entry on a score tally sheet requires correction the only approved method is to draw a single line through the error write the correct entry next to the error and initial the correction white out is not allowed if the date of the correction is different from the date of the score tally sheet show the date of the correction example recording data follow the directions as shown in aim inspection series technical procedures manual which references procedures for recording weights vacuum readings and headspace when recording analytical data on the score tally sheet use the correct units of measure for example if a u s grade standard states that drained weight is recorded in ounces then record the data onto the score tally sheet in ounces rather than pounds or grams color tb sci division inspection series general procedures manual effective date july page of when rounding numbers it is important to observe the significance of the numbers being recorded score points on a score sheet are recorded in whole numbers only score point averages are rounded to the nearest whole number record as record as for specified defects record only to the point of significant accuracy as determined by the method and equipment used for the analysis see the aim inspection series certification manual for additional information on recording analytical data unless otherwise specified net contents net weights drained weights brix readings and other similar factors shall be recorded to the first decimal place example net weight ounces min for analytical determinations in which the value is relatively low usually less than percent record to the second decimal place example total acidity as malic g ml recoverable oil is recorded to the third decimal place example recoverable oil percent

example net weight ounces min vacuum inches min quality factors subject to limiting rules are shown as part of the score sheet for the product as an option during grading the inspector may use symbols to identify or flag any score points causing a limiting rule to affect the sample grade the following list of optional limiting rule symbols may be used to identify score point results that cause a limiting rule to affect the sample unit grade grade b quality factor a circle around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned grade b even though the total score point value indicates grade a grade c quality factor a triangle around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned grade c even though the total score point value indicates a higher grade substandard quality factor a square around a score point value is used to identify a quality factor that requires the sample unit to be assigned substandard even though the total score point value indicates a higher grade note when any abbreviations or symbols are used to flag information on the score tally sheet a key
